2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in May 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch' the child every second day and that after that the respondent had access to her every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. Since then, the child has resided with the petitioner. The respondent wishes to change the status quo on an interim basis to have Keanna reside with him every second week. HELD: 1) The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the extent that the petitioner has 'exercised access with their daughter on fairly regular basis'. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in Keanna's best interests. The affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives satisfy the court that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. 2) The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application. The child's current living arrangements are of no assistance in determining the specific time periods wherein the respondent purported to have had plenty of access to the child."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application. They claim solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff “C” of $3000 to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of their costs of litigation as in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The disputes are generally conducted in civil fashion as evidenced by the Sheas' consent to late filing of the Notice of Contest and the Bowsers' consent of late filing the Rebuttal Affidavit. Ultimately, the sheas, by omitting some important information, undermined the strength of their claim. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct."
9_1990canlii2351.txt,28 year old male with 19 previous theft and property related convictions - broke into a vehicle and stole a computer - damaged motor vehicle  -  18 months for theft and 12 months concurrent for mischief upheld on appeal.,"The appellant pled guilty to theft and mischief. He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. He appealed the sentence, arguing it was too long. Allowing the appeal, that while leave to appeal is granted, the appeal should be dismissed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was right when he said general deterrence must be a priority. The appellant cannot be described as a youthful first offender. His record of criminal convictions begins in 1980. Since then he has been convicted 19 times without counting those instances when there have been multiple charges. In all the circumstances the sentence contains no errors in law that warrant any variation on appeal. 2)The sentence imposed was not excessive."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s.268(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused claimed that he struck the accused in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the accused intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the complainant causing him to suffer wounds. The issue to be determined is whether, despite the claim of self defence and evidence adduced in support of the Crown, the accused was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault, assault by wounding and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to ss.267(a) and s.88. The defence evidence includes testimony given by the accused."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had taken the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) Claims Centre and an SGI adjuster appraised the damage to the vehicle. The insurer deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The 20% deduction for depreciation amounted to $503.73. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) of the Act amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair the vehicle, regardless of the cost to repair or replace the exhaust system as fixed by regulations. 2)Where an insurer acts for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of loss or damage, or to substitute a different mode of discharging their liability, the insurer is deemed to have elected to reinstate. This is not an election under which it is bound to pay or reinstate by its conduct. There may be a binding election by conduct where the insurer has so conducted themselves as to mislead the assured into thinking that they intend to reinstate. However, this is not the case here. A reinstatement under a motor vehicle insurance contract is a different election under the Act. An election under a different type of insurance contract (e.g. fire, burglary, plate glass, steam boilers, etc.) refers to the formal preliminary proof of loss and not to the actual value of the property damaged or destroyed. 3)The definition of an 'election' has received its own treatment. It may be made an express term of the policy that the insurers are not called upon to elect, unless and until they have obtained all the necessary information, and all such plans and estimates as may be deemed necessary or expedient. The statutory scheme is quite clear. 4)Reinstatement clauses are included in insurance contracts for the benefit of the insurer. The benefits to the insurer are that a reinstatement clause provides the insurer with an option to choose the least expensive means of complying with the insurance policy. In Lepin, the basis for finding an election to repair was the insurer's conduct as manifested by its control over the repairs and repairers. It is not unreasonable to expect that the insurer would elect to repair a vehicle if and until it had all the materials before them requisite for their guidence [sic] in deciding which of the two courses open to them would be more advantageous. 5)An express election is not necessary. An insurer's election to fix is an election."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.",The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter while each of the parties independently seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. The maternal grandmother seeks to co-parent along with her husband. HELD: The Court finds that the father is the father of the child and that the child should be placed in the custody of the mother. The father is 26 years old. He resides with his father in Alberta. He works three weeks straight and then returns to Moose Jaw for one week. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the City of Calgary.
d_2003skqb4.txt,"FIAT. The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applies for an order pursuant to s29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. HELD: 1) The respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She continued to be in contempt when she moved with the child to Manitoba without prior notice to the petitioner. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The respondent did not abduct the child. 2) The limited access proposal of the respondent is not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, whom the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor is the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child here for access visits."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues raised in this action were custody and access, child and spousal support, and division of matrimonial property. The petitioner was 43 years old and the respondent 44 years of age. HELD: An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission shall transfer such sum to an R.R.S.P. as may be prescribed by Jeanette. A kind of specified access should be put in place. There was discussion at the trial as to how it should be determined. The farm home is 22 miles from the petitioner's residence. Terrance Heshka has from this date a beneficial interest created by this order, sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. The value for the purposes of distribution is $1,600.00 commencing the first of June 1994. The amount payable to the petitioner by the respondent is to be placed in Terrance's name solely.

2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant in the amount of $51,608. He was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the sum of $61,608 from the date of judgment.  1)The plaintiff was an organic farmer from the Kamsack region of Saskatchewan. At the time of entering into this contract, he had the necessary certificates of conformity required to be certified organic in Canada, the United States and Europe. The documents submitted by Bio Canada, purportedly copies of the German documentation, were not admitted into evidence. 2)There was no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of the entire sum owing to Wlaswich. There was no evidence that the farmer had complied with his contractual obligations to the company, was required to provide oats with a certain quality standard, or that there was nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed.  3)Wlaswich was aware that Bio Canada was reselling his oats. Bio Canada did not explain how they came to pay him $10,000 even though it was not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the company. It is clear in Canada that no one but the parties to contract can be bound by it.  4)HELD: Costs of the action were to be taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs."
5_1994canlii7588.txt,"The defendant was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting his common law spouse. They had separated; she continued to reside in the home with the children. Because of his repeated phone calls, she became afraid to stay in the house. She took the children to her father's house. The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the offence was a period of incarceration of two years and eight months, the total being thirty-two months. In addition, under s.100(1), the accused shall not have in his possession any firearms, ammunition, or explosive substance for a period for ten years. In fixing sentence, find the older cases of less guidance, as the custodial term for such crime has been increasing of late in response to the number of cases appearing before the courts, and the recognition that past sentences have little deterrent effect."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The prospective appellant seeks leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in chambers dated December 11, 2012. The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. In issue is approximately $20 million in legal fees, disbursements and interest which MLG is claiming, and the prospective respondent seeks verification of the claim. MLG challenges the Administrative Judge's order ordering MLG to contact ESI Software, Inc. and arrange for ESI to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. The parties see the implementation of the VA as at Step 1. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by MLG are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal makes an impugned order clearly within its jurisdiction. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. 1) Contrary to the argument of MLG, the amount of fees to be paid to MLG is reasonable and equitable taking into consideration the amounts and basis on which fees are being paid to other lawyers in respect to this settlement. The Administrative Judge directed the parties to determine how verification could be completed without breaching solicitor client privilege. 2) There was no issue of importance requiring the attention of the Court on the issue of the evidence or information upon which the administrative judge relied. The applicant failed to establish there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the state of law, or the administration of justice generally to warrant a determination by the Court. 3) The applicant fails to establish that the proposed appeal will further delay and add to the cost of proceedings. 4) There were no issues of importance to be considered in leave applications as articulated in Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 (CanLII), 227 Sask. R. 238.

7_2004nsca118.txt,"The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before. He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The appellant litigant appealed an order which, in response to an application by the respondent to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The respondent argued that the judge erred in principle by allowing the appellant's variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part. 1) The respondent had never paid any child support voluntarily under these orders and that what had been recovered was as result of the efforts of the Maintenance Enforcement Program placing garnishments against his wages. He also sought to rely on medical disability of which he had given no previous notice. 2) Counsel for the appellant objected to the variation application being entertained because of the respondent's lack of disclosure of income documentation and of his alleged medical problems. The judge indicated that if counsel were disadvantaged, he could adjourn the proceedings. However, the judge heard the evidence and gave his decision. The appellant did not request costs and would order a new variation application on proper material."

The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals. The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.,"FIAT: The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act that the caveats set out in itsoriginating notice shall continue until further order of the Court, or until withdrawn.

Further documentation was required by a trial judge in determining the issue of the validity of Home's interest in the leases involved, including the matter of whether Home's lease violates the rule against perpetuities. The court found that there was a prima facie agreement in existence and that Home was the valid successor of the interest of the Freeholders. The caveat was ordered to be continued unconditionally until a further order was issued pursuant to Rule No. 159 of the Act or until the respondent commenced an action for relief such as having the leases declared void. The applicant was not seeking summary dismissal of the application to continue the caveats but rather a fixed period of time during which the caveator must commence action to establish his claim."
9_1999canlii2477.txt,"The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike. The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appellant argued that the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law by not striking out the originating notice of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The appeal was allowed on three grounds: 1) the application was not made promptly or in time; and 2) the appellant had not satisfied the Court that it was plain and obvious that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable causes of action; the issue of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear in law (the foundation of Justice Hart’s decision); and 3) the Court had no further involvement with the matter."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with knowingly uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused lived on a farm approximately 30 km. east of Prince Albert for some 64 years. The mother of the accused had recently passed away and a bitter family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to his rather substantial estate.

While none of the convictions is for an offence that would prima facie prejudicially prejudice the accused, there was no evidence that the accused was able to hear those portions of the conversation regarding the alleged threats."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve land contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 1) The defendants had been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 2) Although the defendants' activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as it was an abuse and violation of the rights of the people involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 3) The only regulation made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: “A public reserve or municipal reserve may be used for any purpose that would facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area.” 4) The actual wording of the charges to so describe them was that: 1) Prior to the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the Municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. The municipality did not seek permission from anyone. Rather, it took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. The civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves were not directly in issue. The Municipality stepped into that position. 5) The municipality was responsible for maintenance on public reserves, not policing Sec. 197 and, in some cases, for the development of boathouses and other constructions. In the event of widespread violations, great expense and controversy was predictable. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.",The 46 year old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the defendant. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by Mr. Rooke's negligence.

5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. During the search, the accused covered her breasts and vagina, in whole or part, and that her son did not touch her on those areas but did so elsewhere. There was also a misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures searched for that suggested an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief and was potentially confusing for justice weighing the information. The cumulative effect of these errors was that the accused could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to search a nullity, and the search unlawful. The search of the computer immediately without further authorization and/or without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of a warrant render the search illegal."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The evidence-in-chief of the plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. HELD: The action was dismissed. The defendant was not a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sold life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd. The deceased was the author of his own misfortune in ignoring advice and where the only evidence of the advice is from the advisor, there is an evidential onus upon the professional to demonstrate that the caution or advice was in fact given and ought reasonably to have been understood by the client. The plaintiff suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom‘s negligence. The claim was also made for excess probate fees paid by the estate. That was debt of the estate and no action having been brought on its behalf."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order for July to December 2001 covering both children. The parties had two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987.00 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. HELD: The court found that in the circumstances at hand it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for the support of Luke during the months of September to December. Amanda was attending the University of Calgary and all her needs were met. The court awarded the table amount, an amount based on the full extent of the father's obligation and determined presumptively, irrespective of the child's actual needs. The Court found that the respondent misapplied s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines."

The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order.

The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the two young people and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students.

The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.

Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs applied for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to written questions. HELD: The application was adjourned sine die.  1) The Court was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination. 2) The court was unable to conclude that it was clear and obvious that the aggravated and punitive damage claims would fail as against the remaining defendants. 3) There had not been any review of the defendant's skills, technique, judgment or competency in performing laparoscopic surgery by any professional body relating to Lisa Dawson's surgery. 4) The plaintiff had already been extensively examined relating to his training, experience, techniques and procedures. The allegations that could lead to such damages were not scandalous, frivolous or vexatious."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT. The parties, who were never married, had two children born of their relationship: Kayden and Nolan. The petitioner worked every day for two weeks followed by one week off. For the period subsequent to April 10, she ordered that the petitioner have access: (xiv) Commencing Saturday, April 28, 2007, every third Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; (xv) During July and August 2007, the petitioner shall be entitled to take the children for up to two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each. With good reason. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence that there had been a material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. The court was unable to find that there was any material change that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. 2) The Court found that the respondent's employment schedule had changed. She no longer worked evenings or Saturdays. She works out of her home, five days week. 3) The petitioner's request that this access provision apply to this yearis not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT MILLS The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of policy of insurance with the defendants. The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of this claim. HELD: The application for punitive damages was dismissed. 1)The court found that a breach of the contract of insurance between the insurer and the plaintiffs would create a conflict of interest which would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation which would not advance the law or the public interest. 2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. 3)The Court found that there was no duty to third party by an insurance company to deal with claims arising under one of the policies after their issuance."

After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT: An application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee. The respondent took the position that the'mutual agreement' was what is colloquially referred to as a 'last chance agreement'. Based on this agreement and the evidence lead at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The standard of judicial review applicable to the Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 2)The respondent's statement to the grievor of its intention was admissible before the Board for the purpose of supporting its argument that termination was the appropriate penalty given the respondent's years of seniority and previous disciplinary record. 3)The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and concluded that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record, the final incident justified termination of his employment. 4)The penalty of discharge was a suspension without pay for 16 months."

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to indeterminate detention. Prior to sentencing, the Crown applied for remand for assessment pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code and presented materials indicating that Dr. Roger W. Holden would be qualified and able to provide the Court with the necessary assessment. The matter was adjourned to permit an examination by an expert chosen by the defence. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indefinite term of imprisonment. The Court of Appeal remitted the matter back to the trial court as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the opportunities that might exist for the eventual control of the offender’s risk to re-offend in the future."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the issues were not in dispute that CNH Canada and CNH Capital stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies, in respect of credit balances of Wheatland and parts returned by the receiver. There may be a similar agreement involving Flexi-Coil but it has not been provided. The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' which in common English would surely be the case."

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT: This is an application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children, born March 18, 1981 and June 3, 1982.

The mother currently earns $27,600 per annum from employment with a computer consulting firm. The father has also been employed at the Elsterhazy potash mine on a full-time basis since May 1997.

c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act. Pursuant to s.31 of the Act, the agency applied for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s 23 of the act, and an order for personal service of this decision be provided to each of those individuals within fifteen days of receipt of it. HELD: The agency applied to have each child in need of protection pursuant to s37 of The Act, and in the MATTER of an application to have them placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they are not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable and nurturing environment, certainly not at this time. As the first option set out in s37, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the child would in all likelihood remain where they are on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the order being sought. The revised plan was appropriate in these circumstances."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, Brett, who resides with him retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The respondent has taken all reasonable steps to fulfill the obligation, that previous arrangements for child support that contemplate the provisions of the Guidelines were made or that the payee has failed to act diligently and without reasonable cause. The court must do so keeping in mind the objectives set out in s. 17(1)(a) of the Divorce Act. The Court must also exercise its discretion to determine when and from what date a retroactive order is appropriate. 2) There is no presumption in favour of retroactive support. Parliament has left this for judicial determination. It is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of factors that may affect the granting of child support simply because the situations that come before the Court are as diverse as the spectrum of families."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the Charter was infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel.  2) The evidence was excluded because the accused had not matched the VIN number on the dash and registration on the door to the door. 3) There was no evidence to suggest that the accused was carrying contraband.  4) The search of the motor home was done without warrant. Warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable and contrary to the Charter. It is for the Crown to establish, on balance of probabilities, that the search was lawful and that the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable."

The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.

9_1998canlii12320.txt,"Both accused appealed the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts under s239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act relating to evasion of payment of taxes and unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement. The appeal judge decided the trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focusing only on the criminal intent of the accused. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.","This is a summary conviction appeal by both accused from a decision of a Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts against the appellants under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act. The charges against both appellants relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. The Crown argues the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax. Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary Court or this Court. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 at p. 6351. 2) The Crown is asking this Court to overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge by arguing the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. In fact, neither the judge nor the appeal judge were prepared to make such a finding. The trial judge proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of mens rea.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The Court found that the children were not in need of protection under s. 11 of the Act and ordered that the Minister return the children to the mother's care until 18 years of age. The Court ordered that a short term supervisory order be made for the children until the age of 18 years, returning them to the Mother's care under supervision and conditions.  1)The mother was the mother of three children, all of whom were in the child's care. The father had been apprehended in March 2006 and was residing with the mother. The children were placed in the mother’s care until they turned 18. 2)The court found that although most foster care arrangements end when child is 18, she can stay with a foster family until that child turns 18. The court ordered that all of the children be returned to their mother. 3)The Court found there was no evidence that the mother had breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","This was an action commenced pursuant to the provisions of s. 2(a), and of the Fatal Injuries Act, that being Chapter 163 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia. There was no question about liability; it was admitted by the defendants. Each of the grandchildren will be showing in this action the degree of damage individually suffered as result of the loss of guidance, care and companionship which would have been afforded them by their grandmother.

HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The step-father of the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults.

Although she sued both A and her uncle, the assessment of damages was only with respect the damage inflicted by A. The plaintiff suffered from low self-esteem and was unable to be intimate with her husband.

c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence as alleged. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. 1) The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the court must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the Crown to establish the offence. 2) The accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the defendant insurance company, Midway Motors Ltd., commenced an action against the defendant for loss of income from employment. She was a passenger in the defendant's vehicle when it was hit by a vehicle. The defendant claimed the plaintiff was employed for wages at the time of the accident. The plaintiff testified that she had not shown any interest in claiming repayment of the benefits until after the commencement of the litigation. She also alleged that the defendant caused the defendant to 'alter her position to her detriment' by continuing to accept the money. The evidence is contradictory. In the case of the laundromat, the defendant cut off the payments on medical grounds but then came to believe that she was so employed. The insurance company argued that the plaintiff had not done so. The court found that the evidence of employment was contradictory and the plaintiff could not succeed on this claim."

The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","This was a disposition hearing under s. 41(1) of the Children and Family Services Act respecting the relationship between the parties.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","This appeal involves consideration of s.31(1) of the Probate Act and a request from both counsel for the respondents that the appeal be dismissed with costs to be awarded on solicitor and client basis.

As of the date of this appeal, no part of those funds had been returned. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 each to the defendants, with an additional $1,000.00 to Christos. The front of three cheques were filed as exhibits with the Court. There is no issue that the defendants received the money for expenses related to the plaintiff bringing her to Canada. HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment for Lilia. The amount of damages as to this aspect of the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. 2) Lilia claims back $2,400.00 which was paid to the defendant in the amount of $500 per month and then 7 days later the first payment would be taken out. There was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which would have affected the fact that once she was dismissed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had an obligation to record accurate working hours in the record of her employment and housing. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply a gift to assist the defendants to start their new life in Canada. The plaintiff as well could have received a verbal loan with the defendants. 3) The defendant Lilias claims for wages for December 2011. She has claimed that she worked eight days and never received the cheque for her hours or vacation pay. She also claims that she was awarded $960.00 being deductions from her December cheque. 4) As there was no evidence to support the claim that Lilia received the $3,500.00 cheque, there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque and there if no evidence was put forward by Lilia that supports that claim. The balance of probabilities are not satisfied. 5) The court found that there were no costs awarded to Lilia as a result of her failure to obtain the payments that she had lost.  6) The Court was not satisfied that there was a loan of $1 million. The defendant was entitled to the sum of $12,000 from Lilia for expenses incurred by her to have him come into Canada.  7) There is nothing to indicate that matters were not amiable between the defendants and the plaintiff.  8) The defendants have not put forth any information to support this allegation. The counterclaim as to the $500 is not proven."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISLA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. Given his health, his education, experience and physical limitations, the parties' financial situation do not support the imputation of income. HELD: 1) Section expenses are often referred to as 'add ons' to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. Some s. expenses such as those relating to child care costs may entitle the court to impute income. 2) The parties' standard of living is below that of the respondent due to the fact she has four dependent children and a very high debt load. The onus will be on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship. The evidence in this case does not support finding of intentional unemployment. The respondent has been actively working towards obtaining a position with the provincial government. He has been unemployed since May 2003 and has been working on proposals for the province. His current income is below the amount normally required by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The court cannot be excused from his child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations. 3) The evidence establishes that the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and the parties’ financial situations do not warrant such a finding. The Court must establish that the respondent has the ability to seek employment in case where parent is healthy and there is no reason why the parent cannot work."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for unlawful use of sunscreen in front side windows contrary to's.66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations'. The charge was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the charge declared void because it does not charge an offence known to law. The court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges. The Crown was given an opportunity, which it took, to file a written argument on the issue. The trial was eventually scheduled to take place in February 2009. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. He was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: The court ordered that the respondent may satisfy the judgment by way of a roll-over of the respondent's RRSPs to the petitioner in this amount. The petitioner shall have judgment as against the respondent in the amount of $4,994.11. Should the respondent choose to rollover RRSP monies to satisfy the Equalization Payment, the petitioner shall be increased by factor of 1.3. This is to account for the taxable nature of RRSP funds. The respondent cannot hide behind restrictive and literal interpretation to circumvent the order."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident while riding in a vehicle operated by the defendant. The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and, more specifically, on the treatment he received at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital.

e_1992canlii2542.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss insured against by the appellant Hartford. The Province had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The hospital was never at risk for fire loss and the named insured was Delta with loss, if any, payable to the Province. Hartford sought contribution from Delta's insurer, Guardian. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid some $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta. The respondent sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the Guardian policy provided that the building was never required to carry builder's risk insurance. The learned trial judge found the building never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian wasn't liable. Hartford ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. Guardian had no obligation to Delta to pay the fire as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was never the risk for the fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the province or Fraser- Brace for causing it fire. 2)The appellant had no contractual relationship with Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire losses suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. 3)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence and no evidence of the fire causing the fire and the obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province for the Fire loss. Delta was not at risk of the loss of the Province's property as there was no allocation of fire risk to Delta by contract documents. In this case it never did."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed the accused about a block from a business premises which had been broken into. The accused was intoxicated and asked if there was anything in the back of the van that he believed was intended for sale or for sale. The police officer noted that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and asked the officer if he could perform a search incidental to the arrest. HELD: The Court held the accused was detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his pockets, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. The issue to be decided is whether the conduct of the authorities, considered on an objective basis effectively and unfairly deprived the accused of the right to make this choice. Where the stop and the detention are unrelated to the operation of the vehicle or other road safety matters, the fact that the target of the detention is in an automobile cannot enhance the police power to detain that individual."

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s. 143(1)(a) of The Vehicles Act, 1983 applied.

3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found no error in the trial judge's finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. The appellants had failed to rectify the omission after such reasonable opportunities. The court placed much emphasis on the discretionary powers of the Minister and the fact that he was the sole director of the corporation. The defect in the summons did not destroy the jurisdiction of the trial court. The appellant was not dealing with an administrative act such as sending notice or request to file a return in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. The Court found that the respondent did not have the ability to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act."

The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT.

c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

HELD: The application was denied. 1)It is well established that a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair and impartial trial. 2)Pre-trial publicity found in this case was not alone sufficient to suggest that a full, fair and unbiased trial could not be held. The safeguards that exist in our judicial system to prevent public bias from prejudicing an accused's right to fair trial were not in place. The onus is on the accused to establish by evidence that a fair, impartial trial cannot be held in the closest judicial district in which the trial had been scheduled."

The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant showed recklessness and disregard for the safety of others to a very high degree. The only mitigating circumstance was the absence of the involvement of alcohol or drugs. Even so, the appellant's conduct bordering almost on the deliberate warrants the emphasis placed on general deterrence. The three Criminal Code convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law. While this court might have imposed a different sentence, it cannot be said in the face of these circumstances the sentence imposed was unfit by reason of it being excessive.

Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.",The appellant appealed the chambers judge's decision to grant leave to the appellant to amend his claim against the driver of a little red car as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it.

Appeal allowed; the appellant's application for leave to amend was dismissed; the judge's order dismissing the application should be set aside; and the appellant was granted leave to renew the application in the Supreme Court on the grounds that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01(c) and 15.02(1). The appellant should be allowed to renew his application to add Lombard to the list of party on notice to both the existing and proposed defendants.
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, a new trial was ordered. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)There was no need in view of our disposition to conduct an extensive review of the facts. A police officer, on duty as an undercover person, had a conversation with the accused which formed the basis for the charge. 2)The facts before the learned Chief Judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female person. However on a reading of the entire oral judgment, we are of the view she was, in effect, saying that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of money for sexual favours was contemplated. It was strongly urged by the Crown and conceded by the defence that this was the correct test."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and 24(2) of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that Mr. Moore be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure. HELD: The accused's rights were infringed. 1)The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechleets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown prosecutor. That said, the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst. Pshyk's re-direct testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. 2)The Court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on what was a critical point in this case and the time at which this failure was discovered, rendered this trial to be unfair in a way that was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appealed the Chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in principle, disregard material matter of fact, or fail to act judicially. The Court must still decide whether fairness is better achieved by applying issue estoppel or by refusing to apply it. 2) The appellant did not seek to overturn factual determinations made by the Hearing Officer, supplement those facts with new evidence, and ask a different decision maker to reach a different conclusion. 3) The jurisdiction to hear the appeal was not dependent on his argument respecting any attenuated right under SCAN to make interlocutory applications in the court below."
9_2016skqb216.txt,"HELD: The application for interim spousal support was granted and the respondent ordered to pay $500 per month. The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applied for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The court found that the wife had failed to demonstrate a need for support at this time. The court ordered that the husband pay the wife $500 per month in interim support commencing June 1, 2016 and continuing on the first of each month until further agreement or court order. This amount shall be tax deductible to the husband and taxable to the wife. Interim Distribution of Property [1] The wife sought an order to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. She argued that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply in this situation. The husband did not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states that she has failed to show a need to pay. The Court found that although the net assets for distribution were acquired during the marriage, they were not sufficient to provide the husband with adequate support to meet the immediate needs of the former spouses. The wife was also seeking an order for the husband to take out a loan to facilitate the payment of the interim distribution."
1997canlii9808.txt,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,"The appellant sought to have support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities required the replacement of farm equipment. What, if any, portion of the capital costs allowance should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case.

b_2001skqb282.txt,FIAT. The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,"FIAT: The applicant applies for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. HELD: The order of severance granted is in the best interests of justice and the plaintiffs claim shall proceed separate from, and before, the trial of the issues raising in the Cross-claim, the third party claim in this action and the action pending resolution of this action will be dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless."
9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his wife. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. The respondent left but returned about 4:00 p.m. and was in possession of a quart of whiskey. He left shortly thereafter taking the whiskey with him. At approximately 2:00 a.m., he returned to the wife's residence. He pushed her against the wall and then went out drinking with some friends at the Grand Hotel. He had no recollection of anything that took place after that. HELD: Appeal allowed, verdict of acquittal set aside, conviction entered on the charge of assault. 1)It is only in cases of extreme drunkenness that evidence of intoxication is capable of raising reasonable doubt as to the minimal intent required for a general intent offence. 2)Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may make an order directing the trial judge to impose a sentence that is warranted in law. The distinction between specific and general intent offences has been preserved. In general intent the Crown need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent to perform the act of the assault. This intent can be inferred from the acts of the accused; it is minimal intent that he consciously did the act, which is the minimal requirement for crimes of general intent. The defence of drunkenness is available only in relation to crimes of specific intent."
e_1992canlii2523.txt,"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence. Dismissing the appeals, that the trial judge made no errors in his considerations. The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","The appellant was charged with two offences contrary to s. 343(d) of the Criminal Code. He pled guilty and was sentenced to four years imprisonment for each of the two offences with which he was charged and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively. The total period of imprisonment was 5 years. He was the parent of one child when the offences occurred. This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant was represented by counsel, he pled guilty. After hearing the submissions made by his lawyer, and before he was sentenced, he gave his counsel an opportunity to make any further representations he wished. The record indicates none were made. That his counsel understood the law that made Mr. Bourgeois party to the offences is evidenced by his observation to the judge that he was technically guilty of the offences even though he was not actually the person who was holding the gun."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: The appeal of the father is dismissed. 1) The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. The Chambers judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in the status quo, but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the children’s needs and needs. The threshold condition of material change in circumstance satisfied, the court should consider the matter afresh without defaulting to the existing arrangement. 2) Given the state of the evidence, it was open to the judge to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the child. She observed that given their ages and maturity levels, their wishes would not normally be taken into account in a structuring parenting arrangement. This inference was not supported by the written reasons. The chambers judge was also entitled to a reviewable error if the evidentiary record was lacking to the point that it could not sustain her findings of fact."

The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her.

If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.

7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor who was working with the accused at the time of the accident. HELD: The Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood was either taken personally by the accused or was taken by a technician under his supervision. The Court accepted the evidence of the doctor that the samples were taken from the accused while at the Victoria Hospital, Prince Albert. The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand, based on the doctor's opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. The officer testified that he relied on police officers and trusted them. The accused's memory of events was significantly affected by his alcohol consumption on the night in question but he went on to say that he could not be 100% sure that he had taken the blood himself."

The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.

The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant plead not guilty to driving while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

b_2011skpc19.txt,"The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of the aggravated assault. The court found that the accused had a reasonable doubt as to whether the mens rea of the offence, namely that he knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer, applied to him. The Court found that there was no doubt in the court's mind whether the accused heard that communication. The accused did not change his actions towards the officer if he did hear it."

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was simply another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit, and to possibly obtain a new certificate of competency.

8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff’s claim commenced pursuant to the Class Actions Act. The defendants and third parties applied to the court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the action. HELD: The applications to stay were dismissed. The court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action. The Court found that this action and similar proceedings commenced in other jurisdictions in Canada in respect of similar multi-jurisdictional class action claims were an abuse of the court process and that the court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. The applicants relied heavily upon the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision in Englund, which fundamentally changed the considerations upon which the court was guided in determining when to certify a multi jurisdiction class action on an 'opt out' basis."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA Warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support, each essentially identical, have been sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications before the Court are for DNA warrant application with respect to the baby, at least until DNA analysis was carried out on blood or other bodily substances of the alleged father and the alleged mother. The baby is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided by the informant. The basis on which the officer has learned this, and from whom, is not stated. The maiden name of the 19 year old woman, as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is different than the surname of the natural mother. There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest. While it is literally true that the natural Mother's blood sample has been obtained from 'within' her body, it is my view that it cannot reasonably be argued that this blood sample is 'associated with' the commission of an offence. While there are numerous definitions of the words “associate” and “associated with”, there is no indication as to the source of the blood sample, which is based on a two-month relationship at the time the child was allegedly conceived. There was nothing from the biological mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this child. Such statement should ordinarily be included; this is especially the case when the relationship is shortlived. While the Informations attach copy of the Registration of live Birth obtained by the RCMP from Vital Statistics regarding the month old baby, there was no similar registration of live birth respecting his 19 year-old mother, notwithstanding that it appears she was born in Saskatchewan and the document should be as readily available as was that of the baby.

e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom by denying an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at the National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The Employer violated the collective agreement. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member when he was acting in his capacity as Chair of the Board of Governors and not as an officer of the Federation. The Board made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. The reasons as a whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 2) The Applicant was not entitled to an explanation for the reasons for denying the award."

The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","HELD: The application was struck. The applicant was entitled to costs over and above that which was provided in my decision of March 8, 2004 because of the time which he took preparing for the phone conference and because he did not make himself available for the telephone conference and was not available for cross examination.

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite Inc. respecting assets leased by Patchrite to Sweeprite. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Court finds that Patchrite was'regularly engaged in the business of leasing' within the meaning of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' and it required registration. The Bank was found to have priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the lease. The Court concludes that the lease was a lease for more than 1 year and it requires registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Bank's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of Patchrite."

Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue. Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court in chambers (Q.L.) dismissing the appellant's application inter alia to set aside a recovery order issued by the Prothonotary pursuant to Rule 48.01.

The prime procedural value is that ""the affidavit is central to his conclusions and its admissibility, in its entirety, is fully argued"". 3) In this case, ABS applied pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08, for inter-locutory relief from the recovery order and for security."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently, which amounts to an application to change residence on an interim basis. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and perhaps beyond. HELD: The court ordered that the children have telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until he is released from custody. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with the father. While the father has been in jail since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner, he has not been seen by the children for the past few months. This is not an exceptional case. The court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's best interests."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","The appellant appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The appellant's first ground is that it appears to have taken a very short time for the Committee to reach decision that the appellant was guilty of five acts of professional misconduct. The Committee recessed for twenty minutes after full day hearing, before returning with decision. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court finds that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, the absence of any explanation for the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The penalty of the board is excessive. The Court adopts the third ground of appeal. The Commission is self-governing body with power to make rules and enforce them because it is in better position to do so. The decision of the Committee was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented."

The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation.

The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.

3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from an order requiring the receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that ITI retained discretion under its contract with its students as to what course materials it would supply did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any arrangement for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the judge was correct in finding otherwise.

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., Leonard Banga and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The statement of claim contains 87 paragraphs and advances three causes of action. The first claim is for wrongful dismissal. The second cause of action is a claim for defamation brought against the defendant. HELD: 1) The pleadings alone do not assist in determining what the defendants did and do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 2) The specific portions of the paragraphs identified by the applicants are simply extrinsic evidence, and as the claim is not based upon innuendo, they are immaterial to the plaintiffs' actions in defamation and that traversing them will only engage the parties in issues that are unrelated to the real issues at stake. 3) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) of the claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. They are clearly material to the issues of wrongful dismissal and any moral damages flowing from it."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions and child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of a table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. The parties separated in August 2001. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the father has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in 2001 up to the end of 2007. Hardship Occasioned by Retroactive Award The mother acknowledged that she was under an incorrect assumption as to the father's income while being over extended given her responsibilities as to caring for Ryan and her aging parents. She was consistently being told by the father that she did not have the financial ability to provide additional child maintenance and that the order would be retroactive to the date of the couple's separation. The court found that the father was paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Guidelines and that this failure to provide income in accordance was a blameworthy conduct."

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's Charter rights occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017.

The evidence was to await the completion of argument on s. 24(2). The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. The Court found that the admission of evidence of questionable reliability was more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute where it formed part of the case against the accused and the exclusion of highly reliable evidence may affect more negatively on the repute of the Department of justice where the remedy effectively guts the prosecution. The court took comfort in the fact that the accused did not have any discussions with any other officers prior to completing his analysis of the computer."
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he injected it with paint from sprayer rented from the defendant. The defendant was liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the defendant's negligence in failing to warn of the danger in using an airless paint sprayer. The plaintiff had rented the sprayer from a shop owner who was an independent contractor for whose negligence the defendant was not vicariously liable. Although the plaintiff had a partial loss of an index finger, he was unable to function at his job for about three months after the amputation, although he apparently went to work. He needed an extra man because of the missing index finger. The plaintiffs claim loss of income, past and future and that an ordinary user would not appreciate the disastrous consequences of placing finger in front of sprayer nozzle. This is especially so here where the non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated and the defendant cannot delegate the duty of care owed to the plaintiff."

The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(a) of the P.P.S.A., and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s. 29(2).

The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd. (1995). The appellant shall have costs in the usual way on double Column V."

The amount owing on the mortgage was $61,194.91 as of February 12. In issue was whether the home was a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act when s.44(17) was proclaimed on September 20, 1992. HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7. 1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case. The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair). 2)There was no recent appraisal information available. If the respondents have not resolved the debt by sale or refinancing by the return date they will have the onus of providing evidence that the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order nisi for sale.","FIAT. The applicant seeks an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land on which the respondents operate an ostrich farming business. The amount owing on the mortgage dates back to 1988 and the current certificate of title still shows the Farm Credit Corporation as second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000. HELD: The application is adjourned. The court found that the applicant had not established that the land in the period prior to 1992 met the definition of farm land and the upset price that should be included in any order for sale. The evidence submitted by the respondents to date does not do this. The respondent's house on the property in August 1992 fell into the category of what Gerein J. in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair referred to as a'simply a dwelling in isolation'. The land was not a homestead within the meaning of the Act in August of 1992 and the homestead provisions of s. 44 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act have no application."

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The applicant brings a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. She also brings an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990. Much of the evidence is disputed between the parties. Both counsel confirmed that they wished the issues resolved on the basis of affidavit evidence, without resort to a viva voce hearing, with the respondent placing one caveat on this consent: that the court not draw an adverse inference against the respondent for failing to file the financial records of his farming partner, his brother. HELD: 1)The respondent shall pay $454.00 for the support of the two children of the marriage, such support to continue for so long as they remain within the guidelines for the previous year. 2)The applicant shall have solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997, pursuant to s.19 in each of the above years.

The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an interim and interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing of the plaintiff's premises and preventing them from interfering with the lawful use and improvement of the construction site.

In the City of Woodstock where that business is being carried on, the picketing for the reasons already stated, has caused or is likely to cause harm to the appellant. 4)The injunction would continue until the trial of the action. 5)Where any of the allegations were founded upon hearsay evidence and thereby violate the provisions of s.45.20(2) of the Queen's Bench Act, it is just and equitable in all the circumstances that the injunction be granted."
5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, crack cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. HELD: The Court found that the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. The search was conducted as quickly as possible and in a way that ensured that young persons were not completely undressed at any one time. There was concern not only about the loss of drugs but also about the potential that they could be ingested, hidden or destroyed by the accused. The evidence showed that neither officer touched the accused, that at no time was he totally undressed and that the officer removed the drugs from his underwear himself. The Court concluded that the evidence was to form part of the trial proper."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December, 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty. The Court considered contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence having regard to the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada. The evidence of the defence witnesses raises reasonable doubt about the complainant's non-consent and that she was capable of consent."

In order to defend this action it will be necessary to obtain evidence from at least employees, various Aero fabricators concerning the FAA approval, surveillances, manufacturing and inspections, FAA employees, specific FAA inspector and various expert witnesses. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs were to be borne by the cause. 1)There was a real and substantial connection in this case to both jurisdictions. 2)The plaintiff had chosen Nova Scotia as his forum. He had probably done so with recognition of the extreme costs he may face in attempting to obtain the evidence in Wisconsin and elsewhere in the United States to substantiate his allegations and to import that evidence to Nova Scotia 3)The real connection centers around the site of delivery, the residence of the plaintiff, the location of the plane remains and the majority of witnesses anticipated without specificity."

She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. She alleged that the defendants were negligent in allowing her to drive home alone. She also alleged that one defendant, Louise Brodeur, did not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The parties agreed to certain facts which were admitted to be correct. 1)The plaintiff was permitted to drive a distance of approximately 20 miles after a therapeutic abortion. The motor vehicle collision occurred between the defendant's vehicle and the plaintiff's vehicle. The defendant operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction on Highway #103 towards exit 4.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, the Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body and arm. He was burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. The flagman's failure to immediately halt the competition on noticing the presence of gasoline in the interior of the appellant's vehicle was bound to have immediately stopped the competition and alerted the Fire Department to this condition. HELD: The appeal was dismissed to the extent it took issue with Justice Rothery's decision to withdraw her case from jury. The trial judge applied the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence."

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","The applicant, a residential unit owner at Spadina Condominium Corporation, brought an application against the condominium corporation, its board of directors and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act and possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine contrary to ss. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused had served nine months pre-trial custody and was only one month into a youth probation order when he was found with one package of cocaine on his person, he also had $660 cash. HELD: The accused was subject to custody. What sentence is appropriate? He has served approximately thirty days in remand and doesn't feel he would benefit by any more time in actual custody. The Court placed the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The Crown conceded that with this not being a violent offence, and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to any custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Court reviewed the factors that led to the decision to place the accused in custody."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of The Landlord and Tenant Act. The respondents entered into a lease in 1995 with Russell and her now deceased husband with respect to land legally described as Section 30, Township 16, Range 6 West of the Second Meridian (""the land"") together with the buildings on the land including house, barn, and granaries and equipment described in Schedule A to the lease (including tractors, swathers, balers, etc.). The property was for 41 months up to and including April 1999. The tenants were in arrears of rent by more than two months and the rent was outstanding for more thantwo calendar months. The landlord admitted the payment due May 1, 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to thelease wherein the husband promised to repair the damageto the premises from a hail storm which occurred in August 1995 and the damage has never been repaired. The claims for repair were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenant to pay rent, the rent is outstanding and the tenant is required to give notice of the claim of set off to the landlord.  1)The issue should not be decided summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury had triggered the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It is essential that he know now what his future obligations will be. 2)The parties had three children. The respondent remained in the matrimonial home and supported the applicant from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by the divorce judgment. 3)The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 1995 order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs that were reserved in the defendant's judgment dated March 5, 2001. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes. The total fees were not unreasonable and were recoverable from the defendant. 2) The expert medical evidence was of marginal value to the plaintiff. The costs are equitable that the unsuccessful party is'saddled' with them. 3) Costs payable by the plaintiff to the defendant on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of conspiracy to possess marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 6(2) of the Criminal Code and s. 465(1)(c), and possession of a large amount of cash and other valuables. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The investigations and the informations to obtain the search warrants were the responsibility of and the latter were sworn by the accused. The accused was the only occupant of the premises at the time of the search. HELD: The Court found that the evidence obtained by the search was sufficient, even in a warrant, to identify, to a person confronted with a warrant to search his residence, the offences in respect of which the warrant authorizes the search and that the items seized during the search were clearly stated on the face of the warrant. The Court concluded that the accused was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and in particular pages and (the latter outlining, as it was intended to do, the proposed offences in the area) was inadequate and unsatisfactory to meet the minimum offence description requirements contemplated by Form S. 24 of the Code as those requirements were further interpreted and identified to apply in the Dombrowski and Alder cases."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","This was an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was met and, therefore, the application should be dismissed. The test was not met and the accused was not persuaded that his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation to which he plead guilty nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to that allegation."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences charged occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The accused was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. These offences occurred during the transition from the Juvenile Delinquents Act to the Young Offenders Act and were subject to the transition provisions of the latter Act. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The trial judge was not in the circumstances prepared to assume jurisdiction on counts two and three of the Act to determine the proper jurisdiction.
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order granted by Justice R. S. Smith on February 2, 2007. The petitioner seeks that the parenting judgment be varied to provide a four day on and four day off rotation to the parenting schedule and the deletion from paragraph of parenting judgment the respondent's final decision making provision. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent has been successful in having the petitioner's applications to vary dismissed. She is entitled to her costs in the amount of $1,500 to be paid within 30 days. 2) The petitioner has not satisfied the petitioner that a material change of circumstance has occurred. The original parenting judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that was followed. The parenting judgment provided that when an equal parenting arrangement occurred that the petitioner would continue to provide basic Guidelines maintenance as he currently does, with no deduction based on increased parenting time. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998. The marriage breakdown had been established and the parties had agreed on joint custody of the children with the respondent to reside primarily with his father, the respondent, and the petitioner to reside with her mother, the petitioner. The husband was ordered to keep the children on his group insurance benefit plan so long as they are eligible and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for such period as, in the case of each child, that child continues to be a child of the marriage as defined in the Divorce Act. The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the respondent. HELD: 1) The respondent will have to contribute his proportionate share of the orthodontic treatment expenses for the petitioner that is not covered by insurance with the cost of any major repairs to be split equally. 2) The value of the termination benefit as of the date of the petition is $27,333.50, one-half of which is $13,666.75. The respondent is ordered to convey 1/2 of the commuted value of $7,658 (½ of $21,804.38 = $10,902.19) to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner, subject to matrimonial property adjustment calculations. 3) The petitioner seeks adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs and with respect to minimum monthly payments on the Canada Trust Powerline loan. 4) In issue is whether division at the time of petition would lead to an unfair and inequitable result so as to require compilation at a different date, the effect of which would be unequal division."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The parties' parenting time with their two children has been distributed on a two-week basis. For the last five years, the parties have shared child care cost of $800 per month. The parties will retain the interest they acquired in their own pensions. Spousal support is to be paid in the amount of $647 per month beginning June 1, 2006. The parents agree to be designated joint custodians of their children. HELD: The court ordered that the current parenting arrangements remain in effect with the exception of the change regarding Remembrance Day.  1) The expense to Ms. Thomson is actually less than $800 as she obtains income tax relief at least with regard to the sum of the $400.00 that she was contributing; 2) The parties have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest for a 5-year period. The alternating of Remembrance day would not appear to be contrary to the children's interest and would appear beneficial to the parents. The court was satisfied all matters of jurisdiction had been fulfilled. The requirements of the Divorce Act had been complied with in all respects and the grounds for divorce as alleged was proved.  3) The costs of child care were not included in the calculation of the child care costs. 4) The parents agreed to share child care expenses for the first five years of their marriage. 5) The children have been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. There has been no suggestion that this routine has been, or will be, harmful to them. There was no evidence presented to show that this current situation was, or would be, detrimental to their academic or social life. The Court was allowed to take into account the reasonableness of such an expense in relation to the means of the spouses."
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","This was a decision in the matter of Nicolas Grady and Gallegos Grady. A divorce hearing was held in October 2009 and November 2, 2009. The parties marriage was established; the court's jurisdiction to grant divorce was established, the grounds for the divorce were established and there being no bars to the divorce, the divorce was granted. The petitioner applied to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in paragraph 9 of the separation agreement changed in as much as he sought a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Corollary Relief judgment is at variance with the parties' separation agreement. 2) There is no evidence that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. 3) The petitioner has been paying his father $3,000 per month pursuant to a buy out agreement pertaining to his interest in the business since January 2009. There may be changes in circumstances in the future. These changes (no matter how radical or unforeseen) will not have the effect of setting aside the terms of this agreement as the terms relate to division of property and to variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s17. In our view, the Act does not create an inconsistency. 4) The court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in s17(7). There is concurrence with Federal paramountcy when the Divorce Act is invoked."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach and the application was dismissed. HELD: The Court found that there was no actual or inferred prejudice and that the conditions of release he was subject to were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to lead me to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. Given the finding of no actual prejudice, the question remains as to whether the prejudice to the accused in the delay is such that to outweigh the prejudice that would result if the accused was not to face trial for this charge. The six-month delay is not so long as to lead to an inference of prejudice or to a potential prejudice of the accused nor does any potential prejudice caused by the delay outweigh the public interest in having the accused face trial on these charges."
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","HELD: The judgment for divorce was granted at the conclusion of the trial. The issues left to be determined were division of the petitioner's pension, the quantum of child support and spousal support and whether the matrimonial home should be transferred to the respondent or be sold and the proceeds divided.

Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the wife had access to a car available to her. The primary asset of any value is the husband's pension. There were no funds available for any lump sum payment. Even if such funds were available, Scott was an undischarged bankrupt and could not afford to retire in 1996."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court found that the parents could not resolve the issue and defer to the court to determine where the child's primary residence was and thus in which city she would attend school. The court ordered that the child be placed in the home of her biological father, who resides in Regina with his parents. The child was to commence school on September 1, 2013 and would be five years old in September. Although the child was not yet four years old, she had endured a great deal of conflict, instability and change already in her young life. What she does need at this pivotal point in her development is to be exposed to more change and instability in adult relationships while in her mother's care."

In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused.

d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.

As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not usually carry weapons for protection. He was not testifying as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. 3) There was insufficient evidence upon which the Crown could conclude that the defence had not proven beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt the weapon was a weapon within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code. However, there was sufficient evidence on the part of the Crown to conclude that it was a decorative sword and not a novelty sword. 4) The Court reviewed the Crown's case and concluded that the appellant had not demonstrated that he was unable to convey to the trier of fact the data from which the inference was drawn or that the inference had been formed. 5) The test for admissibility is determined by asking whether the evidence sought to be admitted is relevant. This is a matter of applying logic and experience to the circumstances of the particular case. The question which must then be asked is whether, though probative, the evidence must be excluded by clear ground of policy or of law. The Court of Appeal provides a useful description of when an instrument may be found to be weapon on a prima facie basis: One must, I think, start with the premise that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima-facie designed to be used as a weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon"
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property over the past nine years. HELD: The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past 9 years. The court did not order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem.  1) The plaintiffs were awarded costs of $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property during the course.  2) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. They were also ordered to pay $6,000 to the plaintiffs for damages which were caused by golf balls flying from the adjacent golf course onto their property for 7 months of the year.  3) The plaintiff was also awarded costs for damage to their home and their vehicles.  4) The defendant was to be responsible for those damages which had arisen since they became the owners. 5) The court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute a continuing nuisance. 6) Since the problem has been ongoing for ten years and the attempts by the defendant operator to ameliorate the damage has been unsatisfactory, the plaintiffs are no longer prepared to wait and have asked the Court for relief in the form of an injunction to prevent the defendant from operating the ninth hole until the situation has been remedied in accordance with the recommendations of the expert. 7) It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of 7 months would be an interference with the use of the property."

The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions and the Crown appealed. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his sentence and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from 5 years to 10 years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety and were not convinced the grounds relied upon had sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. Turning to the public interest, I think the prospective appeal as a whole is not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being is not necessary. To do so would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."

Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town made an application pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act, 1998 S.N.S. c.18 directing the removal of a ground sign erected at 152 Provost Street. It is alleged that the erection of the sign violates the Town's Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. The Town conceded that the by-law limited freedom of expression while still achieving its objectives and which objectives are benefit for the community. It was also determined that the means used by the municipality to achieve its goal through the bylaw were reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant's right of freedom.

The applicants challenged the decision of the Labour Relations Board as being patently unreasonable and that the word removal as found in s43(1)(c) read separately or in conjunction with the remainer of the section could not reasonably be interpreted to include closure of a business or part thereof so as to constitute a technological change within the meaning of s43.

The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act. 1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error. The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition. Although this decision was now before the Court of Appeal the Court was bound by it. 2)It was not appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction.  3)The applicants were awarded one set of costs against the respondents.,The Labour Relations Board held that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practicewithin the meaning of s. 43 of The Trade Union Act by failing to provide the Minister of Labour with notice of technological change.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for a bond in the new legislation. Almost every application would so qualify. 2) The court was not served with notices of application for property guardianship and did not intervene in such applications."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by. Before he got through to the turn, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. He did not make the turn until he had afforded a reasonable opportunity to the driver of the approaching vehicle to avoid the collision. HELD: The Court found the defendant not guilty. 1) The defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failing of yield, the defence of due diligence has been established. 2) The court found that the defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT. The applicants sought an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council on May 7, 2007 that the school be closed effective August 15, 2007. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law did not suggest a strong prima facie case. The court found that the respondent board failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. There was no evidence or suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. The respondent's income is deposited into a joint bank account, into which the breadwinner deposits his or her earnings, does not justify imputing a portion of that income to the homemaker spouse. The fact that the corporation owns but one truck, operated by Mr. Petersen, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that income from the corporation should be imputed to the petitioner is nothing less then ludicrous."

The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with two offences under s.254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence, knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person.

Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date. HELD: The Court granted the application for adjournment and directed the defence to make the necessary arrangements to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness for the Defence in this preliminary inquiry. The Defence was not guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The evidence adduced at preliminary inquiry does not reflect the whole of the evidence presented at trial nor does it reflect the strength of the Crown's case at trial."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.",The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer observed an individual operating a vehicle and asked for driver's licence and registration. The individual identified himself as Tyler Hoover and admitted that he was prohibited from driving. HELD: The Court found that the identity of the accused was established and the circle of identification was completed. There was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown; service on lawyer may not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. The Court was satisfied that the notice was given in accordance with s. 260(6 of the Code.
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the defendant corporations were obliged to answer questions related to the mode of transportation of helicopter flights and the operator of such flights. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory, it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to the overall allegation of unsafe operation. The Court found that allowing questions on whether the project was over-budget at any particular time does not mean the plaintiffs are entitled to question the details of the budget, or why money was spent in certain areas as opposed to other areas. The report of the safety officer at the main camp site was not privileged because he was requested to prepare safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident."

The court has jurisdiction to vary the agreement on the grounds alleged notwithstanding that the Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction .","This was an application to determine whether this court had jurisdiction to vary the consent order of the Ontario Court of General Division. In the action, the wife sought to set aside an agreement she had made with the husband, which was incorporated into the Ontario court order. She did so on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered the agreement.

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","The respondent seeks an order varying the child maintenance payable pursuant to the order of F.W. Dickson J. dated July 16, 1993 by reducing the maintenance payable thereunder from $250 per month for each of the respondent to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by the Act; cancelling the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and varying the access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1) The principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in The Guidelines and The Act. The principles governing the extinguishment of arrear are canvassed in Currie v. Currie (1989), 1989 CanLII 4470 (SK QB), and the Act.  2) With respect to the first issue, the respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order and therefore was not prepared to reduce the payments. 3) The respondent's gross annual income was $22,993.00. 4) The parties agreed that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and 2 weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 5) In the circumstances the court advised the petitioner to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 6) The father was not able to access the children on the terms heretofore stated. 7. No costs are awarded to either party."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties. The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the Delta Sydney hotel since 1989. At the time of the grievance, she was employed in the front desk department. Her return from maternity leave had not resulted in a reduction of available hours for employees with less departmental seniority than she. She was the first to experience reduction of work hours when she took up her new position. HELD: The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation and that the appellant's interpretation could not be said to be patently unreasonable. The appellant's conclusion ascribes meaning to that clause which its words cannot reasonably bear and which was apparently not argued before her at the arbitration hearing. Although there was clear evidentiary support for her essential findings of fact, the court was unable to determine the existence of any logical process by which the final conclusion could be drawn."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The Crown argues that the trial judge did not consider that the appellant's speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. The errors of law do not constitute questions of law alone and cannot support an appeal from acquittal."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff's claim stand dismissed: the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General, Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and the entire claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs under double Column V and the (sic) other below set aside. The court found that the limitation period did not run from the expiration of the stay and that the application should not be allowed because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt is a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment. In this case, the Bank of Montreal obtained judgment against the respondent and others for $65,753.50. The Bank served a garnishee summons on the respondent in an effort to garnish the money owed to the respondent under the GIC. The respondent responded by responding to the summons saying that there was a debt owing under a Guaranteed Investment Certificate maturing December 24, 1996 in the amount of $10,000 with interest paid annually at 8.50% and was not presently due. When the respondent applied in Queen's Bench chambers under s18 of the Attachment of Debts Act, the judge dismissed the application saying there was no obligation on Firstline to pay monies into Court and therefore, no judgment could issue."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied by notice of motion dated June 26, 2006, to vary the judgment of Justice Foley. The original custody judgment provided for joint custody of the child, C.A.S.M.M., with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation to the Yukon. 2)There had not been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the original judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for a joint custody arrangement, was possible. 3)There was no evidence that the mother had changed her mind regarding the child's future in Saskatchewan. 4)The mother had not indicated that she was opposed to the father's application for sole custody. The evidence from the trial did not support the decision to move. 5)The court reviewed the seven factors set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon v. Goertz. The court found that the father should be granted sole custody if the circumstances in this case were changed."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied to the Court for judicial review to quash two orders made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in the subpoena duces tecum and in a series of production orders, process that infringes the substantive rights of the Board. The Board declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record. There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or why it rejected all the submissions made by counsel for Wal- Mart Canada respecting it. The only reference to the relevancy requirement is that the Board did not address Mr. Beckman's concerns or objections in any meaningful fashion but ignored them."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent with Allstate. The agreement provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month and renewal compensation calculated in accordance with the average renewals for the prior two quarters. The contract also provided for relocation counselling. The plaintiff was to receive pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, for the first two years of his employment with the defendant. At age 50, he would presumably be limited to contacting persons for whom he had no prior business dealings or associations, unless he had previously been unsuccessful in selling them insurance on behalf of the defendant; his prospects for developing a book of repeat clients was not as great as it was in his 20's particularly when he was precluded for two years from soliciting or selling insurance to persons he had earlier sold insurance to. The defendant was awarded 20 months salary as damages in lieu of notice. HELD: The court found that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages arising out of the termination. 1)There was no month for which he had not been compensated during his period of employment with him. The failure of the plaintiff to accept the non-competition clause had no part in his termination. 2)The plaintiff had made reasonable efforts to seek and obtain alternative employment."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","This was a divorce proceeding. The parties had been in a relationship for approximately years. They had two children and years of age. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The children were in the husband's care every second weekend. The husband requested sole custody with the children in the wife's care. The court found that the wife had demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. She did not take the opportunity to meet with the husband personally and of the requests he made in respect of the children. She often did not reply to his inquiries. HELD: While shared parenting is inappropriate for these children what about joint custody? Conflict between parents does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. The evidence suggests what violence there has been between the parties was often initiated by the wife. However, this did not occur with the consent of the husband. Discussions about what is an appropriate decision to make for child's benefit should not be overwhelmed in a power struggle between the parents."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.

Trial took place in Provincial Court on one of the charges, and the applicant was convicted. The remaining charges were held in abeyance pending an appeal on the one conviction. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing, even if it should become known to the Crown, is notgoing to result in any new facts that are not already known to it. The Commission is not relying on conviction, it will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of ss.112(1)(a) of the Act, and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the grounds that his non-lawyer agent provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The appellant's lawyer withdrew before the appeal was heard and counsel of record on the appeal inherited this situation. Technically the affidavit of the appellant is 'fresh evidence' meant to demonstrate the ineffective assistance of the agent Klassen at trial. This fresh evidence is not directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the basis that the agent's ineffectual assistance resulted in miscarriageof justice. 2) There was no reason why the same conclusion would not follow when an accused chooses to be represented by an agent who is not lawyer is foreclosed from raising the conduct of that agent on appeal. 3) The objective fairness of the trial has not been diminished because of the tactics used by the appellant and his lawyer. The appellant was not entitled to the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide, that came as a result of the decisions he freely made."
3_1997canlii9782.txt,"The Crown appealed the six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s334(a). HELD: The appeal was allowed and the following ordered: a restitution order payable directly to the employer in the amount of $8,528; the six month conditional sentence was affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered plus restitution was to be paid in full at a rate of $200 per month; the period of probation was decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence. The maximum allowable probation period is three years and the sentence imposed was therefore unenforceable.","The Crown appeals the imposition of a 6 month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order against the respondent for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s.334(a). Clearly the maximum allowable probation period is 3 years and therefore the sentence imposed below is unenforceable. HELD: The Crown appeals. The sentence imposed is three years conditional with an additional condition that he shall pay restitution to the respondent at the rate of $200 per month commencing in December 1997 until the full amount is paid."
3_1999canlii12841.txt,"The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674. The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits. Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","This was an application pursuant to Rules 664(1) and 674 of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman. HELD: The application was dismissed and the local registrar was instructed to return the matter to chambers on August 19, 1999 in order to hear argument on the merits and to allow counsel for the respondents an opportunity to file material."
e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was working as security officer for a department store, was run down in a crosswalk as he was pursuing a shoplifter. The van was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries as a result of the impact. Allstate Insurance joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act whereby it is defending the action against its insured Jerome Thomas under reservation of rights. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The only clear evidence before the court on the identity of the van is that of the plaintiff himself. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the issues of the vehicle which struck the plaintiff and its owner and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it when the incident occurred."
9_2003skqb459.txt,"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and operating a vehicle that was in possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cannabis marihuana in an amount exceeding 3 kilograms, for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 249(1)(a) and s. 267(a). The subsequent questions pertaining to the gym bag were improper. At the moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the accused. The accused's words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. HELD: The evidence was excluded. 1) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. If the aroma of liquor or drug is evident, the question then becomes one of the proper test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. The Court found that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the accused's vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both. 2) The Court held that the evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded. 3) There was no quarrel with the visual inspection of the vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the car. Although the safety of the police might make it preferable to use the flashlight at the earliest opportunity, it certainly can be utilized at any time as necessary incident to the check stop routine."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant seeks to have the firm, Robertson Stromberg, barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of Ms. Schirr, a member of that firm, having been active in representing the defendant, a Crown corporation, prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there is no suggestion that the subject matter of the action, the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action, were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitor. HELD: The application is dismissed. Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel, the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that is, one which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. Review of the file herein suggests that no such strategy exists. The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. In the earlier application, the tendency to use applications of this sort as harassment technique was used. Once it was determined that there was no actual knowledge of the case in question and that there could be no real knowledge of one being attributed to the other, the onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.",The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The accused was over six feet in height and weighs more than three hundred pounds. OC spray was used but had no immediate affect on the accused who was handcuffed and placed in the back of police car.
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. She now appeals her conviction on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and the defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In assessing all the evidence the judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility but proof to criminal standard. This information sheet does not form part of the court's judgment. Quotes must be from the judgment, not this cover sheet. The full court judgment consists of pages. The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that she went to use the bathroom, but only to smoke the rest of her drugs in private without having to share it with others. She denied ever seeing his wallet, robbing or strangling the victim or being part of a plan to rob him."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the law with respect to consolidation has become unclear since the advent of the new Rules. There is no evidence before the Court to establish that the series of transactions are all part of the same transaction as contemplated by Rule 37.02. The Court found that there was a common question of law and fact arising out of the management and supervision of similar investment accounts over a similar period of time. Although the pleadings and submissions of counsel indicated that the matters would be heard together, there was little evidence to assist the Court in fully appreciating just how similar, and potentially duplicitous, the evidence at four separate trials would be."
2_1999canlii18445.txt,"The accused was charged with the sexual assault of his 13 year old step-daughter, which led to her impregnation. Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with one count of committing sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. He was the step-father of the accused step-daughter who, at age 13, gave birth to a full term baby girl. The accused sought to exclude DNA evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter rights were breached. Following voir dire, the accused signed a consent form to have blood drawn. The Crown relied on the warrant and in the alternative, the consent of a person for the authority to draw the blood. The manner in which the warrant was executed was perfectly reasonable. There was no challenge to the constitutional validity of the law and the accused was elected to be tried by the Supreme Court Justice alone."

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The defendant sold business equipment to the plaintiff in September of 2007. The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. HELD: The Plaintiff had not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities and the defendant was not in breach of the agreement. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within two years of the claim being discovered. The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment which can be loosely categorized as the Cash Equipment and the Camera Equipment. The Cash Equipment was designed to enter and receive payments for purchases at the Inn, mostly restaurant purchases. The Camera Equipment is designed to provide security and to monitor the employees of the business. The Plaintiff signed an agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with the equipment and that they would inspect it or have someone else look at it to establish if anything was wrong with it. The Defendant did not do this and despite continuing to make regular payments on the equipment, had done nothing further to ensure that it was working for the purposes for which it was designed. The conclusion from the evidence was that there was no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff's claim to succeed. There was no material representation and no fraud. The defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and installed and it was in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times."
d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought.

6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The defendant company and the sole director of the company were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and misapplied them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not to the extent and effect the judge thought appropriate. The appeal went quite beyond what the case called for. The question throughout has been, and continues to be, whether the steps taken by the company and Mr. Varga in the course of operating the Weyakwin facility for the purpose of manufacturing these log-home packages were such as to bring the operation of the facility within the meaning and scope of the licensing requirements of the forest resources management act, beginning with s. 18.1."

The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Seizure of Criminal Property Act seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent.

As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood did operate a motor vehicle contrary to ss.255(1), s.253(1(b) and (c)of the Code. While most breath testing instruments have methods to detect the presence of mouth alcohol in breath sample, they are not 100% effective. As such, it is important that a continuous 15 minute observation period be conducted prior to the analysis of each breath sample to allow any alcohol which may be present in the mouth to dissipate. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The accused did not attempt to call anyone nor did he ask permission to do so. When he was advised of his rights to counsel after his arrest and demand for breath sample he declined to do it on two occasions. The police officer was not in position to take the breath sample forthwith and could not know when the ASD would become available. Throughout, the police officer did not act with any sense of purpose or urgency."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.",HELD: The Court held that it did not support the plaintiff's theory of causation (post-partum hemorrhage caused by retained products of conception and failure to perform C) resulting in the ultimate hysterectomy. The Court also found that the hospital staff were negligent in the performance of their professional duties and services upon the plaintiff by failing to remove the vaginal bleeding from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure (D & C). The Court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the nurses' notes were prepared in circumstances any different from those in Ares v. Venner.
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood contrary to s254(5). HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1)The accused's respiratory problems made it impossible for the accused to provide a sample. In fact, nothing registered on the intoxilyzer. 2)Even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. There was no urgency to proceed and to do so right after his call was what triggered the violation of this accused's rights. The case has to be decided on the balance of probability that there was a Charter violation."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving the proceeds of oil recovered on certain lands upon which the applicants had registered builders' liens. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicants had not met the first test of prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience, but with more stringent requirements for the mandatory injunction. 2)The plaintiffs had not established a strong probability that grave damage would accrue to them in the future. 3)The court found that the applicants' application for a declaration as to their entitlement to builders' lien on the properties and, in default of payment of the builders liens, the interests of the defendants in the properties'may be sold and the proceeds applied in and towards the plaintiffs claims. 4)The Court held that the plaintiffs' application under paragraph 2 of its notice of motion must be dismissed.

7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.",The accused was found not guilty on a charge of driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under s.253(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer. HELD: The Court found that the accused was not trying to evade the police officer. The Court accepted the evidence of the Alberta Court of Appeal. The defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that he had consumed a few beers in the evening and then decided to go for spin. The offence was committed when the accused turned on his emergency lights and the drinking history was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the history he gave to alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott.
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was found guilty of two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was observed from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. The Crown's motion for observation post privilege was granted and the accused was allowed to make full answer and defence despite not knowing the exact address from which the police officers observed the transaction. The evidence of the police officer who observed the accused walk back up Uniacke Street to the corner of Gottingen Street where he encountered a black male in the crosswalk and then with apparently no answer proceeding down the street to the rear corner of the store. The police officer testified that there appeared to be a conversation that was not audible and that the accused gestured to another place for the deal to take place. The trial turned very much on the facts of the case that the Court will find having regard to all of the evidence and whether the accused stashed these drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The accused had consumed four or five drinks. There was no other observable signs of impairment. The officer asked the accused to enter the police vehicle where he asked him to provide sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the instrument registered failure, the accused was arrested for impaired driving and read his right to counsel as follows: There is an informational duty, which is not an issue in this case. The trial judge was entitled to review, re-examine and re-weigh the evidence, but only for the purpose of determining if the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) There is no breach of s. 10(b) and whether evidence should be excluded are both questions of law. Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination. 2) The voir dire is the accused's right to speak to counsel of the accused’s choice. The fact remains that when the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned and another name was sought from and provided by the accused. When that computer search resulted in a large number of names, once again the officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of named names. There really is no similarity. The name was that of relative who was known to the complainant. It was most unlikely he would mistakenly pronounce the name. At all times he was alert, quiet and polite. His speech was not slurred. It is unlikely that some physical impediment caused him to make mistake. 3) The officer was not provided an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","This appeal was brought by the registered owner of the property pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act as a result of the preliminary decision of the quasi-judicial board rendered July 9, 2007 and the final decision of a quasi-legal board rendered December 15, 2008 confirming the demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the 'City') with certain conditions. The respondent appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed on all grounds. 1) The board's order was confirmed and confirmed. The demolition order was suspended. 2) The respondent was given the opportunity to bring forward a written proposal to the board committing to the operation of the building under a qualified professional property management firm with proven record and acting at arm’s length to the applicant. This proposal must be accompanied by a copy of the sale agreement which discloses the provisions of this decision relative to the use of the premises. 3) The Board was asked to review the fairness and reasonableness of the order and whether it had the jurisdiction to decide as it did. The board found that the building inspector at the time of issuing the demolition ordered properly determined there to be a nuisance relating to use and activities surrounding the building, which adversely affected the amenities of the neighbourhood including the safety, health and welfare of the people both resident and non-resident. It is too late to raise such an allegation now. There is no denial of natural justice with respect to police information."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 (property) to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to the 2010 Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There was no retroactivity problem. 2)The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity was found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016. The Director's application was brought on December 16, 2016 and the Court found that the application was not statute barred and that no order can issue with respect to property seized prior to the date of discovery.  3)The Law Enforcement Director had been caught off guard by the new law, lost vested rights or that the basic rules were either unknown or changed."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father of one child applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The mother was underemployed and the father had not obtained full-time employment with another employer. The father's decision to work only three months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. The court reviewed the father's financial position and found that he had not been successful on this motion. The Court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  2) On all of the evidence, the father was found to be unemployed. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful.  3) The court determined that the father is underemmployed. He has not been able to find employment that is reasonable in light of the substantial delays in this proceeding and the fact that his child support application was commenced in June of 2002. It is also clear that the discovery motion which heard in this matter would not have been necessary had the father provided appropriate financial disclosure."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB.

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant applied for an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Jessome. HELD: The application was dismissed. The preliminary issue was as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. He had the right and the right to be wrong. If there was any remedy, it would be by way of appeal, not by a prerogative writ."

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","Division of matrimonial property. The petitioner did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy makes the calculation of what each party hopes to recover from the marriage assets problematic at best. HELD: 1)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300.00 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of my original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. 2)The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the previous maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. 3)The respondent did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required income to live on and the barley fell into that category. In any event he paid one half the net proceeds to his wife which covered the division of the property in November. In addition the petitioner argued that for the foreseeable future he will be unable to make any maintenance payments to his former wife. The evidence supports this position so the order that there shall be a variation be made down to the nominal sum of $42,400. 4)Division based on asset values which are at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. 5)When all of the assets have been liquidated and it is determined what amount is actually available for division then I direct it to the respondent and 44% to the wife. Each side shall bear their own costs."

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc., while a corporation in the province of Saskatchewan, wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not succeed and accordingly had little assets in theprovince. The plaintiff alleged that it did not proceed with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)There are appropriate circumstances (dismissal) to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security in the present instance against either or both of the plaintiffs. The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 2)Rule 547 is not a code which confines the court's jurisdiction to those areas particularly mentioned in the rule. The common law has not been supplanted entirely by the rule and the court is still permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure by ordering security in instances not covered by the Rule. 3)The court has the power to order security in all cases where it is thought just to do so. In the case of a joint claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs which could be awarded to it in the event of successful defence, in excess of $55,000, in circumstances where the plaintiff no longer carried on business and was without assets, the Court is not persuaded that thereby the parties would be more inclined to enter into meaningful settlement discussions as alleged."

The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. 2)Wascana Energy is to be taken as having properly exercised the right to appeal. It turned to the Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, asking the Committee to direct the Board of revision to hear the appeal. The Committee declined to do so for in its opinion the company had failed to give notice to the administrator within the period prescribed by s.303(1), and the board did not have the power to extend the period. 3)The fact that the notice did not arrive within 20 days of the mailing or publication of the assessment was an indication that the legislature intended that the effect should be fatal when it did not contemplate giving notice by registered mail in accordance with the statute. This was especially so in the circumstances, for the assessment had not only been completed well in advance of May 31st but had been published several days beforehand, leaving ample time for the performance of these duties. Nor did any other form of prejudice arise. [4]The Committee concluded that Wascana had exercised its right and effectively to allow the appeal to be entertained by the board of revisions."

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.

The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. Hrynewich Holdings dealt with circumstances similar to the case at hand. The appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Under the provisions of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act the right of a lender to recover the unpaid balance of mortgage securing the purchase price of farmland is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates as well as to any collateral security including a guarantee. 2) The respondent bank was found to be the controlling authority in this case. The appellant bank was entitled to take out the deficiency judgment against the mortgage balance.  3) The decision in Andrew (CA) would not have been made had it not been for the appellant bank's decision to apply the proceeds of sale against the balance owing on the purchase money portion of the loan and then pursue Mr. Andrew on his personal liability to pay the non-purchase money portion. 4) The court found that s. 25 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,000.01) to be applied to purchase money debt and (most likely, non-Purchase money) on a pro rata basis to determine the amount of deficiency judgment.  5) The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the ss.25 of the Code and held that the amount owed by the appellants was $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $372,582.48. The remaining LCRA protection was $1,066.72. The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take into account the balance owed."

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.

The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied.

Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.

5_2018skqb216.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The plaintiff bank applied by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the plaintiff pursuant to her mortgage and to some other costs related to the mortgage. The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: The issue is whether the pro rata distribution of purchase money proceeds and non-purchase money proceeds in any deficiency judgment pursuant to a judicial sale extends to the total outstanding amount of the mortgage. RBC applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The judicial sale by real estate listing was previously confirmed by the order of Danyliuk J. of October 27, 2017. HELD: RBC is entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.  1) The solicitor's costs assessed are assessments levied against the condominium owner's unit for unpaid contributions to the common expense fund or the reserve fund. These are charges that are allowable pursuant to s. 11 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L16 [LCRA]. 2) RBC also claims two other charges pursuant to its mortgage. First, RBC has paid $2,528.90 for arrears of condominium fees. Pursuant to ss. 63 of The Condominium Property Act, 1993, SS 1993, C26.1, a condominium corporation may register a lien against the title of the owner’s unit or reserve fund for unpaid contribution to common expense, reserve fund, and the applicable GST and PST. These charges are permitted by s. 8(1) of the LCRA. Any inspections and administration fees have not been claimed by RBC.  3) As at November 1, 2017, the total assessed solicitor‑client costs, condominium fee and property management charges ought to be added to the deficiency judgment, along with the prorated principal, interest due. Counsel argues that it was required to incur the extra legal costs to proceed by judicial sale in order to pursue recovery of the deficiency against Partridge."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court, which determined that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the respondent entered in the Provincial Court was reinstated.  1) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and s. 34(1), and found it was fundamentally the same for both provisions. The Court found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. The trial judge failed to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the force was necessary, whether the level of force was reasonable in all of the circumstances, and whether the respondent's response to the assault was reckless. The appeal court judge erred by applying the wrong standard of appellate review.  2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary, the Court should not expect an accused person to weigh that force to nicety. 3) The court found that it was common ground that the principles set out in the Code govern the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest and they apply to police officers. The court also held that the provisions in effect at the time of the offence were inapplicable."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The Court found that the police conducted an unreasonable search and that the accused breached his rights for about 11 minutes, by not informing the officer of the reason for his detention and by not giving him his right to contact counsel. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which was significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused. The accused was asked by the police officer if he had any further dealings with him. The police officer told the accused that he was being detained for a possible hit and run or impaired driving charge because he was sure the accused was the driver of the vehicle. The defence argued that the search of the accused's vehicle and the retrieval of evidence from his pocket were in total breaches of his rights under s. 24(2) and breached s. of the Charter. HELD: 1) The Court concluded that the detention was not arbitrary, the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation. However, an officer who detains for investigative purposes must inform the accused of the reasons for detention and must also give to him his rights to counsel without delay. 2) The exclusion of the evidence from the search and seizure was a breach of the Accused's right to be free from an unreasonable seizure. It was a warrantless search and it was unjustified, unreasonable and illegal."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. The appellant had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was small part of the claim. The Learned Trial Judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the double-ply. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge. The law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. 2) While the test for judicial impartiality is stringent, the Court should not err in the admission of expert evidence. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. The decisions concerning the manner in which individual proceedings are conducted are best left to the judge. 3) In the classic case of R. v. Mohan, [2007] SCC 33 (CanLII), the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. 4) In this case, the appellant had the necessary experience in respect to foundation and structural repair that he could give expert evidence as to not only the type of foundation repair but also the need for structural repair."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim-complainant resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault; and (ii) the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence, of any kind, had been committed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of Yebes v. The Queen, the Court of Appeal held that the evidence did not yield up any other reasonable inferences. 2) The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. They relied on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides that the question of identity was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by the description of the victim's injuries by the witness (the counterman at the 7-Eleven), by the opinions of both the police and the investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted. The testimony in that respect was highly tentative and could not form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference. 3) The appellants failed on the procedural point. 4) The Circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient tosustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion."

Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children. The wife sought spousal and child support of $16,868. She also sought an unequal division of matrimonial assets and a lump sum award. HELD: The Court granted the petition for divorce. 1)The Court found that the Court had jurisdiction to order the wife to work more than she had agreed to do in the Partial Minutes of Settlement and that it had the jurisdiction to force the husband to find an optional security to satisfy the bank on the 'Treats' loan. 2)The court found that there was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The Court reviewed the numerous financial consequences to custodial parent not reflected in the direct costs of supporting a child and found that it was necessary that the wife continue to supplement her income to the extent necessary to meet that standard."

He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.

The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1993. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On March 21, 1994, the landlord served the tenants with a notice of the termination notice. On June and July, the deputy rentalsman reviewed the tenants' complaints and issued a decision. He did not provide a legal reason which would preclude him from making the decision. The Deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's claim for possession was rendered May 13, 1994. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs.  1)It is my interpretation of the deputy rentalman's order that he was exercising jurisdiction under s.47(4), and it was possible for him to so exercise that jurisdiction. This obviates the necessity of deciding whether he also had the jurisdiction to abate rent under s47(2).  2)The issue was whether the landlord and tenant had the same right to a share of the rent in a rented premises. The differences between the landlords and tenants did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by tenants."

Both parties sought to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year and was in excess of $10,000 in arrear. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. The father was to take immediate steps to put himself back into position to provide for child support payments. The court was unable to find that there had been a material change in circumstances as required by the previous order, and the petitioner's application in this regard was dismissed.  1) While there was an application brought by each party, the application was not made in the Petition pursuant to s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. 2) The petitioner was unsuccessful in opposing this application and was entitled to costs which fix in the amount of $200,000. 3) The father's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was found by the court to be insufficient grounds to vary his childsupport obligation. It was apparent he was capable of earning considerably higher income and had taken no steps to test the job market.

The evidence, all of which was provided by the cardiologist, should lead the committee to the inevitable conclusion that he is a competent cardiologist and that his practice follows more closely that of other cardiologists rather than a family physician. 4)The committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession.

When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT.

Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] Howard applies to vary the order of the Court of Queen's Bench by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 12, 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay maintenance for his children. HELD: 1) The parties have one child in their custody and pursuant to their agreement and the divorce judgment, no maintenance was payable. From and after November 1992, the parties agreed to joint custody of the children and in the event both children were living with one of the parties that the 'non-custodial' parent pay maintenance of $175 per month per child to the custodial parent. This agreement was confirmed in the judgment of Matheson J. on September 14, 1992.  2) The husband has experienced depression and unemployment over the past number of years. He declared bankruptcy in July 1994 and is still financially dependent on Sandra. 3) The children have significant student loans. The husband earned $48,000. By 1993, the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year. 4) The wife has been paying child support since the agreement was signed and the husband has not paid any ongoing maintenance for the children."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The petitioner commenced this divorce action against the respondent in 1990. She claimed custody of the children, support for both herself and the children and an equal division of matrimonial property and costs. HELD: 1)The Court held that the reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance for the children was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. The Court also held that spousal and child support should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee's report and Recommendations on Child Support. 2)The respondent was granted custody with reasonable access to the petitioner upon reasonable notice. There was no issue of a medical discharge. The court valued the respondent's pension at $56,000. The respondent's income was $52,000, which was in excess of the amount recommended by the court. 3)The court found that the respondent should retain the goods in her or his possession without further adjustment. Given the length of the marriage and the options open to the respondent to enhance the value of his pension for his personal benefit and, more importantly, the significant economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner, the Court awarded him the sum of $5,340."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant. The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act. The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs of this application were in the cause. 1)The applicant did not take issue with the repossession effected by the respondent but rather was seeking a ruling that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, is not now entitled to claim any additional payments owing from the applicant. 2)The application was misconceived. This court lacks jurisdiction to grant relief under Part V of the personal property security act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The Crown contends that the intent of the section is to protect the privacy of any sexual activity of a complainant and that right should just as appropriately extend to instances where that person is the victim of an assault. 2)The failure to permit the appellant to cross-examine the complainant regarding another complaint she made about sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. Section 228 has no application to payment of chronic pain benefit for injuries during the window period.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At 1:42 a.m., a roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside breathalyser test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis. The accused refused and the officer read from his 'card' when making the demand and again when making a breath analysis demand; he read those demands from that card when giving his evidence. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only appropriate remedy was stay of proceedings and costs.  1) The accused was qualified to give expert testimony concerning the operation of the breathalyzer machine used, the quality of the solution, its reliability and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. 2) There was no issue to determine until the Certificate of Analyses was filed and the pertinent evidence was heard. 3) It was not necessary that this be a 'live issue' or does the defence have an absolute right to this disclosure and does it follow that failure to produce the standard alcohol solution calls for a judicial stay or costs? 4) It is the duty of the Crown to make timely disclosure to the defence of all evidence supporting innocence or mitigating the offence. The Crown plays an essential role in the truth-finding function of our system. The need to develop all the relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments or verdicts were to be fashioned on partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence it must depend upon full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. Accordingly, our approach with respect to the production and discovery of objects or material for independent testing must comport with that fundamental notion.  5) The Court was not impressed with the testimony of the accused and reject it. There is never any one reason for rejecting the evidence of a witness. The evidence of the Accused was straightforward and reliable."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment. Dismissing the appeal, that although he had intercourse with the complainant, such was with her consent. The firearms prohibition order made by Chief Justice Glube under s.100(1) of the Code will, of course, remain in force and effect. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is an accepted constitutional principle in the United States that the right of an accused to 'have the assistance of counsel for his defence' guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. 2)The respondent must show in addition to the lack of competence on the part of defence counsel that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the trial would have been different."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appeals from the conviction of driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds for appeal are that the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence;(b)That the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction can be entered; (c)Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this court may allow. The appellant has not shown an error by the trial judge on any of these grounds."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant, a licensed insurance agent, prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the Homeowners for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their Swarovski crystal collection. The appellant prepared a form which cancelled the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage which did not constitute a 'listed peril' as defined by the policy. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the appellant. He gathered the information from the homeowners, reviewed the existing coverage, and completed the application. He did not ask to see the policy nor did he contribute to the amount of the judgment payable to the Homeowner. Although the appellant was negligent and liable for the loss, the trial judge concluded the appellant contributed 50%/50% by their negligent acts, to the loss sustained by the Draders. There is no general duty on the insurer to provide coverage beyond what is understood by the broker."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The plaintiff union represents approximately 10,000 Health Care Workers. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was reached on August 13, 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010. However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs concede that the court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue based on the CBA and the Weber principle. They contend however that the statement of claim, while it does not assert a viable cause of action, can nevertheless serve as a platform for the present application for mandatory injunctive relief. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed.  1) It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make retroactive adjustment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. The results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 2) As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutory relief. More particularly, if the court were to encroach on the arbitration process in the way that has been proposed by the plaintiffs the result would be inconsistent with the determination of the Supreme Court in the Weber case that the model of overlapping jurisdiction is no longer to be followed."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and from obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade a witness from testifying against him. The Crown applied for an order that the accused be declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was found to be neither dangerous nor long-term offender. The Court of Appeal addressed the requisite factual underpinnings to assist the sentencing judge in determining whether the sentencing sanctions under s. 753.1 are sufficient to reduce the threat of public harm to an acceptable level. 1)The accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviour showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. 2)If the Crown has failed to prove that J.R.S. qualifies as a long term offender, the court is required to impose a sentence on the accused for the convictions. The court is of the view that if the accused has proven both patterns of behaviour, it does not have to prove both. The pattern does not depend upon the number of offences but on the repetitive nature of the offender's behaviour. 3)The sentencing principles articulated in R. v. Lemaigre (2004) were often referred to as the 'Gladue factors'. 4)The Crown was only required to prove the pattern of behaviour as defined by s.753(a)(i) and/or (ii). 5)The court was of the opinion that it could not rely on the RCMP to provide whatever evidence would assist the court in determining that a long- term offender designation could be imposed."

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his right knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to pick up lumber and other materials for a job on which he was working. He was unable to fully participate in the business and, as a result, suffered loss in that he was required to hire other persons to carry out some of his tasks. The court awarded the plaintiff $5,000.00 by way of general damages. HELD: The plaintiff had suffered an injury; the injury restricted his activities during the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent the following year and to very limited extent, continues to the present.

To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","HELD: The Court found that there was no conflict of interest and that Pink Breen would be permitted to continue to act. The applicants should show by fact or even by reasonable inference that the substance of the current action was broached during the plaintiff's tenure at the plaintiff, that the seeds of the alleged scheme were sown during their tenure. There was no evidence before the court that a solicitor and client relationship existed between the applicants and the plaintiff. The court found that the confidences were relevant and that they were shared amongst the lawyers of the plaintiff firm. The Court also concluded that the plaintiff had not breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiff by disclosing confidential information to the defendant. The decision was based on the strong inference that lawyers who work together share confidences cannot, without waiver, come back to haunt him inadvertently or otherwise."

The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.",HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the Sobeys lease. It was to be enforced according to its terms as amended. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The plaintiffs relied upon Miller v. Toews and Canada v. LeBlanc for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable harm is less vigorous or less telling in cases of breach of negative covenants. The receiver applied for a permanent injunction and the application for permanent injunction were dismissed. The court found that it would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach was alleged.
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second child, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment.

5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts in the Information alleging contraventions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and the defendant fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and died as a result of his fall. The defendant had the greatest degree of control and authority and he had the ability to create and maintain a safe and healthy workplace. However, the defendant bore a very high degree of moral blameworthiness and the appropriate range of fine and creative sentencing options was significantly lower than the range recommended by the Crown."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons not well-founded in law and whether the decision affected the accused's right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. The issues in this appeal were whether the trial judge's decision to grant the adjournments was based upon reasons that were not well founded in law, whether the court's decision affected whether the accused retained counsel to represent him at trial, and whether it affected whether he had a right to a fair trial or a writ of certiorari under s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for the children gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicant had made significant improvements in the cleanliness of their home and that they were prepared to cooperate with the Agency to have the children returned to their parents. The court found that there was no new evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting counselling or parenting counselling before the appeal was heard. The Agency opposed the application on the basis that the applicants had not made sufficient progress sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","This was an application by the plaintiff for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act, 1998, s. 29 and/or s. 1 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference on July 16, 2002.

If the parties had not reached settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from any such discussion in any subsequent proceeding would be prohibited. 2)The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of the settlement and must be permitted to refer to the minutes in his affidavit. 3)The defendant did not file any affidavit material in opposition to the application. 4)There was no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for negligence is subject to the two year time limitation period in s. 3(1)(d)(i) of the LAA. Even though the claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years, the 2 year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. It may well be impossible from practical standpoint for the plaintiff to establish, by balance of probabilities, that he did not discover, or should not with reasonable diligence have discovered, the wrongful nature of the Federal Crown's acts and the nexus between those acts and his injuries. As such, the 12 month time limitation in the POPA does not apply.  1) The language of s. 24(1) is clear and its meaning unambiguous. Even if the time limitation is removed, time begins to run under s. 2(1(a) of The Exchequer Court Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury and damage ceased. 2) Any claims arising from acts or omissions that fall within the scope of s3(3.1) cannot succeed in this court under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to June 1953. The only vehicle available for bringing proceedings against the Attorney General of Canada in provincial court is the Provincial Court. 3) Although the plaintiffs purport to bring this action for the negligence, breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, they have failed to plead cause that this court has jurisdiction to entertain with respect to anything that occurred before May 14."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of the League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and Executive Committee, which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee chose to accept the evidence of the appellant over the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Discipline Committee did not err in its determination that the Appellant intentionally caused the principal of the school to believe that he was conveying the substance of the written report to the principal. 2)The discipline committee did err in applying the onus of proof as defined by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Camgoz v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1989 CanLII 4432 (SK CA), 74 Sask. R. 73. 3)The disciplinary committee did not erred in its finding that the appellant committed professional misconduct by misrepresenting the school improvement process report, which was critical of the principal's leadership and recommended that he be transferred. The Committee was satisfied that in doing so, Mr. Paquin intentionally misrepresented the contents and recommendations set out in the report as indicated in this charge."

The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum as follows: On September 10, 1994 the respondent negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant. The complainant was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to the complainant's apartment to confront him and get his money back. At that point the respondent pulled out a knife and threatened the complainant, who was frightened by the threatening behaviour with the knife. The appellant was arrested on the charge and was held on Remand until the date of sentencing. In the proceedings before the trial court, it was considered that the entire time being one year. The Crown gave credit of 2 years for the one year he believed the Respondent had spent on remand and therefore imposed a sentence of 2.5 years less 1 day concurrent on each charge."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant brought a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the plaintiff's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis. HELD: The Court awarded costs in the amount of $3,500 to the defendant.  1)There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 2)The circumstances and factual findings justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs. Further the circumstances warranted an award for Solicitor/client costs in a limited amount. 3)The Defendant's pre-motion brief was relevant in regard to the determination of costs. On the merits of the case, whether there was an implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July including the order of witnesses, as was suggested by the Plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. 4)The plaintiff did not have any authority for the proposition to exclude the defendant's representative from the discovery of the plaintiff’s witnesses.  5)The court reviewed the circumstances of the motion and found that the plaintiff had made an improper use of the subpoena. 6)Rule 77.03(2) and Rule 77.12(1) were applicable. 7)The Court was of the view that the comments in the Defendants pre-trial motion were unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. The Court had the discretion to increase the tariff depending upon the circumstances. 8)The costs awarded were in keeping with the length of the hearing."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about a variety of matters including, but not limited to, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home, and the division of family property. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the application was not in any way intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. The Court found that it was an error in principle, and reversible error, to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of an order of the Court. It was also inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen's Bench Rules."

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction.  2)The evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant had much different story. Primarily he realized that he was so impaired that he performed some acts which involved the use of it or its use. For example, he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up. He attacked the evidence that the two ambulance attendants (paramedics) were mistaken about his wanting to start the vehicle.

c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.

The Crown appealed the sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, the fact that their motivation was financial gain, and the motivation was motivation. HELD: The total sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served. 1) The respondents had already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing officer for which they should be given credit. 2) They were trained in their techniques by the criminal organization. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. It was clear that if the sentence imposed for the predicate offence was reduced to take into account the mandatory consecutive penalty for the aggravating offence, the effect was to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory minimum penalty required by law for the separate, distinct and serious offence.  3) The sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside. In each case, an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents would be 18 months, concurrent, for the last two counts, 1 year consecutive for the Criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil. The option was exercised in 1973 and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff in 1973. The title was encumbered by,inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The action was based upon s. 237 of The Land Titles Act which provides that a person employed to buy land for another takes the title in his own name, his certificate of title is no defence against the rightful owner. He is merely trustee for him, and the Court will enforce the trusts unless the rights of the bona fide purchaser in the meantime intervene. This and similar cases were summarized in V. Di Castri, Q.C., in the following way: In any event, it was never intended that a registered owner, merely by exhibiting a title, should be able to escape the performance of contracts he had entered into prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration of his interest, or to deny trusteeship which may be fastened upon him by law. On its face it appears that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser and his vendor. It affords no protection to registered owner against equitable rights which he himself has created and is not a defence when his title is attacked by person rightfully entitled to the land."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge:That Kevin Eugene McGuigan of Regina did commit numerous assaults on Ashley Bjornson by slapping and striking her with miscellaneous objects contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Codeand was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of one year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. The sentence of 1 year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, it will no doubt mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family relies."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress in a wrongful dismissal action brought by the respondent. The appellant employee had been hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces and it was expected that she would be away for three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included not only making sales contacts but co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The conduct of the appellant prior to the dismissal was offensive and unjustified, any injury it may have caused the appellant cannot be said to have aggravated the damage incurred as result of the dismissal. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 2)The Court found that the conduct advanced in support of a claim for damages for mental suffering must constitute a separate 'actionable wrong' from the breach itself. 3)There was no evidence of damage of this type to the plaintiff."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","In Saskatchewan the law governing the enforcement of foreign judgments in this jurisdiction is set out in The Foreign Judgments Act. In this action the plaintiffs seek to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded them by Carver County District Court in the State of Minnesota. The action is defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and, though served with notice of the action, did not appear before the Minnesota court or in any way submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the plaintiff was, at the time the action was commenced, ordinarily resident, in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support that conclusion. It is quite impossible to give a precise and inclusive definition of the term'residing' which is highly flexible and its many shades of meaning vary not only in the contexts of the United States but also in the jurisdictions of the foreign country. The time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 2)The term 'ordinarily resident' is not defined in the Act so turn to case law for assistance."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a 1994 motor vehicle head-on collision. He brought an action for recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers. The issue of liability was severed following a civil jury trial in April 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000.00 plus taxable disbursements. HELD: 1)Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A) is not a substitute for an assessment of damages nor is it a mini-trial of any sort. Rather, it is likely that the plaintiff will recover a substantial amount of non-pecuniary damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory negligence and any arguments of failure to mitigate that might arise. 2)The plaintiff's claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the plaintiff does not yet even form part of the pleadings. The court is unable to form an opinion of what damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff at a final assessment. It is not appropriate to order an interim payments be made for her benefit."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","This is an appeal from a sentence imposed on the charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. Counsel argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the learned Provincial Court judge to proceed with the trial. On the first appearance of the appellant in the Provincial Court on October 15, 2001, the Court was advised that the Crown was proceeding by summary conviction. On subsequent appearance, the appellant entered a plea of not guilty and the case was set over for trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The time limitation on summary conviction proceedings imposed by s. 786(2) became relevant. The appellant also appealed the sentence of his sentence. Counsel for the appellant argued that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced in or implicitly consented to the Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction by agreement. Counsel did not agree with that position and sought the appeal from the learned judge. The appeal should be heard in this Court now or alternatively in the Court of Appeal based on the present trial record.  1)There was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is impossible to determine whether the trial judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence is excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. The procedural irregularity is not subject to the provisions of s. 822(7) pertaining to defect to which the accused has not objected. 2)The appellant's arguments were entirely self-serving and quite correctly accorded no weight by the learned trial judge."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner seeks interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997.

The petitioner was employed as a substitute teacher until the birth of their son when she became a full-time homemaker. The mother continues to be employed as full time homemaker in Richmond. HELD: 1)The forum of convenience is where evidence will be most easily accessible concerning the routine, habits and proclivities of children, being necessary considerations to determine the best interests of all the children.  2)If the court had jurisdiction for purposes of making a decision regarding custody, it would have declined jurisdiction."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","This was an appeal from an interlocutory order dismissing the appellants' demand for particulars of general damage. The appellants had alleged that the respondent 'negligently or fraudulently' misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that they sold to them. Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract. Twin Mountain Construction (the appellants) claimed that because the property was materially less than the size it was represented to be, its plans to extract sand or develop the property were negatively affected. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 14.24 provides that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 2)The appellants were entitled to know the amount of the claim for general damages based upon expected profit from the development of property and/or the excavation of the sand. They could not file a defence until such information was provided. It was difficult to conceive of what additional information they need at this stage. The respondent has specified the type of damages that it seeks. 3)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole. There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) which can be utilized by the respondents to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.  4)The matter on appeal is an inter-locutory decision of a Chambers judge. The standard of review is simple but stringent one. This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result. 5)The Chambers judge erred at law by ordering better particulars of the general damage claim, which were generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. The appeal and cross appeal are both dismissed. There will be no order for costs. The appellant is essentially, asking this court to set aside the trial's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence, and to attribute larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. HELD: 1) There is no basis in law upon which we should adjust, upwards or downwards, the appellant judge's assessment of general damages for general pain and suffering. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case.  2) The appeal is dismissed and the cross appeal is both dismissed without costs. It would take strong and cogent reasons for a court to interfere with a trial judge's findings as to the credibility of a witness who testified before that trial judge.

TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver up to TFPG, forthwith deliver all files, documents, statements of account, records, plans, software or other material respecting clients of the plaintiff.

In addition to numerous clauses in the agreement setting out the rights and obligations of the parties, the respondent agreed that breach by him of any of the provisions of the agreement may cause the company great and irreparable injury and damage which cannot be reasonably compensated in damages in any action in law and the contractor hereby expressly agrees that the company shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breach or recurrence of breach.  1) In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (1) there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (2) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; (3) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief.  4) The respondent was registered representative of the applicant and entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause by carrying on the same business on his own.

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","The plaintiff sought to continue to garden on the plaintiff's property and use the Borden driveway. HELD: The plaintiff was satisfied on the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that the Longard brothers in combination used a 'Borden driveway' in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. This use continued uninterrupted after Roy Longard received the portion of Eldred's land and as long as Borden remained on his property and continued when the property was transferred to the Church and then to the Mills family. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein. Prescription or 'Lost Modern Grant' The plaintiff's claim to the use of both the Gardener's and Borden's driveway was formalized by a letter dated August 20, 1996 to the Plaintiff. It is telling that this reservation does not say that the road in question provides access to Eldred Longard's property. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as roadway running proximate to the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence was alleged to have occurred on September 5, 2013, on Highway 55 near Peerless. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The Crown found the accused not guilty. The Crown submits that the offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that Mr. Dallyn disputes is that he passed highway workers when he was travelling fast than 60 kilometres per hour. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle. Bradley George Christensen, the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitoring device, testified that he did not speed past any highway workers, nor did he record the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or did he say that there were highway workers and other highway equipment in the speed monitored zone. None of the documents proved that the vehicle did anything of the kind."

One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for jewellry and personal clothing, to be divided among them. He effectively stated that he was leaving his assets to'my child Jane, my child Nancy, and my child Richard'. HELD: 1)The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than a class gift. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in J.D.'s Will. Counsel have urged the Court to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention. In that clause, the judge underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. The underlining of the two words solely and absolutely and the direction that such inheritances 'is not to form part of matrimonial assets' shows that he has included or excluded members of the class by name. 2)The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of a testator.  3)Section 31(d) of the Act provides for a general rule that a person's gift falls into the residue expressly subject to contrary intention, i.e. to be shared by all persons falling within the general or generic description and to exclude anyone not then alive. It appears that the Court has found for or against the characterization of gift as class gift depending on the effect such finding will have. In this case, the Court may find gift is class gift to prevent lapse should one or more members of a class predecease him."
2_1999canlii12398.txt,"The parties were involved in an accident. The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding. The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident","The plaintiff, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw a car driven by a woman approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway. He applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car. The damages to both the plaintiff's truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and the defendant's counterclaim for the same. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the Henrys for his $500.00 deductible, the defendant for his counterclaim and the Henry counterclaim. 1)The Highway Traffic Act places an additional duty upon such drivers. Although Henry complied with the rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to. 2)The circumstances at this intersection were somewhat unusual, in that the vehicle was 39 feet back from its edge of the pavement, which itself approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway and the plaintiff complied with a requirement to stop. However, there was no other traffic. Even if Schmidt concluded that Henry was going to proceed into his path, he had more appropriate alternatives than locking his brakes and turning to the right. There was no one traffic. He could apply his brakes, maintained control of his vehicle and moved into the oncoming lane."

The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006.

There is no order as to costs. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's judgment. The trial judge had an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact. The court of appeal must extend a substantial deference to the findings of a trial judge. 2)The trial judge accepted most of the evidence including her evidence as it related to an implied admission by the respondent of some existing indebtedness owing to him. Nor did he expressly reject her testimony as to the amount, $1,900. However, there was other testimony, contradictory, before the court on that point. The transcript clearly showed that the respondent unequivocally denied any loan made to him by him. 3)The appellant was not persuaded that the judgment was not reasonably supported by the evidence or that there was an overriding error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact in the judgment. There was no order for costs. The appeal was dismissed."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank was the source of the credit report for the plaintiff and the Bank Loans fell into default as a result of the plaintiff's failure to report to Equifax the borrower's default or delinquency upon the Bank's credit report. The plaintiff Bank commenced this legal action for payment. The defendant defended and counter-claimed against the bank for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by an amendment application made at trial and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff bank's costs against the defendant were taxed. 1)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff, including its obligation to pay the loans from the proceeds of his accident settlement. The counter-claimant's claims were upheld and they were dismissed in total. 2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P-3 existed. The court concluded that it was this credit line agreement which formed the basis of the agreement between the plaintiff Bank and Royal Bank. 3)Although there was some argument as to whether or not this or some other credit agreement formed the foundation for the credit and loan presently sued upon, there was no other evidence upon which an allegation of breach by either party of its contractual obligation, duty, duty or fair dealings occurred with respect to the nature and manner of the loan reports it issued to the credit agencies and which were reflected in the Equifax credit report issued. 4)The plaintiff Bank was awarded costs of the action against the defendants (the Royal Bank and the plaintiff bank) in the amount of $1,000,000.00."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08, as the charges are more formally particularized in the Information. The defence admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was the factual one of whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, the police officers were directed to drop in while on routine patrol. The accused tended to answer questions by resorting to what he normally does and was not able to state what he specifically did on the morning in question. 2) The defence evidence lacks reliability. The evidence does not accept that evidence nor does it leave me in a state of reasonable doubt. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony, based on who was asking him questions, caused me to have considerable concern."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the only viable options were to permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to the Archerwill district or to change the primary residence of Tyson by placing him in the home of Rocky. There were negative consequences to the relocation of Tyson from Kindersley to Coleville. The move was to an entirely new and different community. The special needs of Tyson require that he have the assistance and support of someone to whom he is closely bonded.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). The appellant argued it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed. HELD: The appeal was allowed to proceed. 1) The transcript may now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date is confirmed.  2) The appellant did not see the letter from Transcript Services. It would require conclusion the appellant must go behind both the practice of Transcript Services and the correspondence from the appellant. The appellant must check that the interoffice mail system has not malfunctioned. 3) In interpreting s. 123(1), the ordinary meaning of the words of that provision must be read in the context of the Act as whole and in the Context of Part VIII in particular. It is important to keep in mind the purpose of the act and the legislature's intention in enacting the provision. The provision is benefit conferring and accordingly must be given a broad and purposive interpretation. It must also be interpreted in a manner that will not lead to absurdities.  4) The appeal is to be struck without the appellant having done anything incorrectly. This necessarily means it cannot sit on its hands and allow delay to build without any consequence. Rather, by putting the onus on the appellant to do what it is required to do, the Legislature is assured of speedy small claims process. This achieves one of the principle goals of the entire small claims system of administering justice. 5) In those cases where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this Court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice is done as between the parties. This discretionary remedy is set out in ss39(9). That subsection provides for remedy in the event a transcript cannot be provided for the appeal. This is part of s39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of transcript and the failure to file within the 6 month provision. In that case, the court may make 'any other order that the judge considers appropriate.  6) To allow an appeal only to have the appellant do anything incorrectly leads to an absurd result. Were it to be allowed, the appellant would lose right of appeal, and judicial determination of the claim, without fault."

At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.

Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

It was a claim in professional negligence for the losses sustained by FCC as a result of the alleged negligence of Gillis. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed. 1)The defendant had been engaged by the Langilles over the years as their solicitor and he continued to act for them on their behalf in this transaction. 2)There were other circumstances which militated against FCC in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s. 50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, is entitled to payment of PST from third parties in undetermined amounts on the basis that the third parties were liable under the Act to pay PST on the materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The plaintiff also seeks interest on the amount claimed from the date of payment of the Sales Tax to the Government at the rate prescribed by the regulations. The third parties brought an application to the court to be allowed to defend the liability of the government of Saskatchewan at trial. An order was made, and the third party parties were permitted to defend against the government at the trial. At trial, the matters to be adjudicated on the pleadings are whether Husky is awarded the refund of the PST from the Saskatchewan Government, whether the amount to be refunded is to be reduced by virtue of the limitation period set forth in s. 56 of the Department of National Revenue Act. The Saskatchewan Government has joined the cementing contractors as third parties. HELD: Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST in the amount of $393,289.73 it was entitled to refund of PST on materials consumed by third parties pursuant to the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax Act. 1) Even if the Government was not responsible for the PST paid by Husky, the Government properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to section of The Provincial Sales tax Act and Regulations thereto. 2) There was no mistake of law in the payments of PST made by the parties to Husky. 3) Husky's amended statement of claim is without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to its contracts between the second party contractors and Husky Oil.  4) The third party contractor denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim dated March 26, 2002, the Defendant's Reply to the Demand for Particulars dated May 9, 2003 and the Plaintiff's Amended Statement of claim amended July 20, 2005. 5) The plaintiff is not entitled to judgment against the Defendant.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.

Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely the prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)The affidavit was to be received as evidence unless the officer is challenged in that respect.

Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Trade Union Act. The parties agreed there would be no discrimination against anyone because of their sex. The mere fact that the parties had included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. The only method of enforcement available to the parties was the complaint procedure set out in the Code. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact the terms of the agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction in the early morning of May 16, 2001 During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. He remained in custody until 7:30 a.m. that morning. The plaintiff was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The position of the defendants is that the plaintiff was lawfully arrested for obstruction and that the cut he received on his head was by-product of his resistance during arrest and did not involve any more force than was reasonably necessary to arrest him. The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 having previously been married in Sweden. There were no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing was the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agreed that all property had been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. HELD: The respondent was to pay $10,000.00 to the respondent.  1)The respondent's evidence was far from satisfactory. It was only in view of her stated intention to return to Sweden that she consented to the Court dealing with the issue. 2)The amount suggested by the respondent did not, even with the support she had already received, equal the amount of the need. The respondent's economic prospects, particularly on the move to Nova Scotia, had been impaired by the marriage. The Court was satisfied having regard to his education and obvious skills in computer programming that he would be able to obtain the funds necessary to make lump sum support payment to the Respondent."

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre Inc. (""VIP"") or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The applicants had entered into written sub-lease of office space with VIP for term of 50 months and an optional renewal term of 1 year upon 3 months' notice. The latter had sub-leased portions thereof to several sub-lessees. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicants were not entitled to relief from forfeiture but, rather, on what terms such relief might properly be granted. The terms on which relief may be granted are obviously important to the head lessor and, as the cases demonstrate, the court must have regard to the effect the grant will have on the headlessor's interests.  2)The applicant had proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. Since neither the applicants nor the applicants had initiated an action, the Court should be satisfied that the granting of the relief will not unfairly prejudice or adversely affect the Head lessor.  3)The actions and performance by the applicants fell short of constituting partperformance for the purposes of s. 4. In the alternative, the applicants are bound by their subleases as consequence of taking an assignment of VIP's leases. In this case the applicants have established the essential requirements for valid renewals of the head lease and their sub leases, and that they had met the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. In other words, they are not the sole tenant in a'stand alone building' of the kind in Saskatoon."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cannabis marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the search. The accused argued that his statement to the police was voluntary and the police had not proven that the officer had reasonable grounds for the search of his person. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the accused was not detained and, therefore, no police duty under the Charter was triggered prior to arrest. There was no evidence of what he was thinking prior to his arrest. The Court also held that there was no breach of the accused's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. The court found that the police officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon an inference based upon observation (i.e., smell) the smell of burned marijuana, which was not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, sought to have its roadways delivered to the Department of Transportation and Communications. The applicant had failed to obtain the required consent of the owners of the land where water will drain from the road. The developer had proposed to construct a ditch or drain across the land of the Haverstock Estate, but the estate refused to consent to the drainage. The respondent's application was refused and the court awarded costs in the amount of $3,000 to the appellant as against the respondent's costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. The scope of appeal was limited to the construction of a ditch and drain and the award of costs to the respondent was appropriate."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void. HELD: The appeal is allowed.  1) The principle question is whether this 1950 Freeholders agreement is void under the common law rule. It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule.  2) Although the lease has been held to be void by the rule, it was never intended to provide information to the public interest whereby it could undermine the interest of the company. However, neither party had ever before experienced a situation where it was suggested the lease creating the interest was void. For whatever reason, it chose not to do so. 3) Although these 'top leases' have been attacked on other grounds, it is this situation which has come to be known as the modern era."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386, which is what he had been earning.

The material indicates that the respondent's circumstances have changed since April of 2001. First, he is now employed as tow truck driver and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510.

c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending the Attorney General's appeal of a certification order in a class action. They alleged that the Steel Works' facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH's and other toxins. They sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification order was issued. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs of $1,000 to be payable in the cause of the appeal.  1)The Court of Appeal did not decide whether the motion for stay should be granted. 2)There was no evidence on the point that establishing how defending individual actions would cost the Province less than defending common issues trial in class proceeding did not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court.  3)The court was not in a position to assess whether the proposed stay would cause irreparable harm. 4)It is reasonable to assume that, over the ensuing eight years up to today, the Province has made significant progress toward drafting its Defence and accumulating documents. The court has struck out claims for negligence in relation to regulation of the steel plant and the plaintiffs have decided to narrow the claims, including by reducing the scope of negligence alleged and abandoning pursuit of some remedies, such as compensation for diminution of property value and for personal injuries. 5)If there is no stay and if the province's appeal succeeds, the course of the class proceedings in the SCC will be a par for the course in the course for the rest of the litigation. 6)There is no evidence that the Province's grounds of appeal are arguable on their face. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish that pre-conditions for a stay of this type of litigation. 7)The judge sensibly intends that there will be only one Notice, published after the Court's decision, not as a side effect of stay from the Court."

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision.

The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had complete control of the two workers but that he chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters. He also failed to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of seven offences. The essential facts of the case are not in dispute and they are fairly straight-forward. The defense objected to the admission into evidence of remedial progress report that was simply marked for identification pending the ruling of the court. Because the uncontestedfacts of this case are quite sufficient for the purpose of reaching a final judgement on themerits, the Court found the report inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling and without making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility."

The respondent, who represented herself at the taxation hearing, objected to the applicant's cross-examination, arguing that it was an obvious overbilling. HELD: The application for recusal was dismissed. 1)The applicant's first complaint was that she was 'overbilled.' The Court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the respondent. 2)The respondent's evidence regarding her retainer did not provide sufficient guidance respecting appropriate procedure to be followed in the Small Claims Court. It was also found that the respondent had asked more junior lawyers and other members of the Applicant law firm to assist her with the matter in appropriate circumstances (and as expressly discussed in the Respondent's Agreement). 3)There was no indication whatsoever of over-billing whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements. There was no evidence that the applicant, who had previously appeared before the same judge, was overbilled."

The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. They contended that they instructed the solicitor who was acting for them at the time of the trial (and who is not the solicitor on the appeal) to call certain expert evidence dealing with the causation of the fire. The solicitor called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause. The appellants argued that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if accepted would permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings. HELD: 1)The application was denied. The Court of Appeal held that the tests for the admission of fresh evidence in this case were well known and were set out in R. v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 672. We were not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the cause of the Fire. There was evidence which could have been adduced at the trial. It was the appellant's contention that in the interests of justice require that the rule of due diligence should not be strictly applied. 2)The applicant was not persuaded that the application was allowed."
1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","The mother sought the custody of her daughter on the basis that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The father, who suffered from injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident, was unable to work and was dependent on disability payments received from an insurer. HELD: 1)The issues before the Court were the custody issue and the central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests.  2)The father was 33 years old and suffers from injuries he sustained in 1991. As result of his injuries, he is unable to earn a living, work and receive consistent instruction from his parents and other caregivers. 3)There was no convincing evidence to suggest that the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne diminished his ability to act as custodial parent for the child. 4)The court reviewed all of the evidence presented during the five-day trial and concluded that it was of paramount importance that the child have as much contact with her or his parents as was consistent with the child's best interest. 5)The Court had consistently applied the principles outlined by Lord Simonds in McKee v. McKee, 1951 CanLII 305 (UK JCPC), [1951] D.L.R. 657 (P.C.) at p. 666. To review all of such evidence presented at the five day trial would be unproductive and lead to prolix judgment. 6)It was necessary to deal with the distant past conduct of the parties only to the extent the same is relevant to her or her ability to care for the children."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse and (2) interim spousal support in the amount of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006. HELD: The Court finds that the childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary and falls into s. which requires the said cost to be paid pro rata to the parents' respective incomes bear to the sum. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent, 71% of those costs which is monthly sum of $125, and that the respondent shall bear 72% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described.  1) The parties agreed on custody, access, basic child support and entitlement. The petitioner's input reduces the cost of daycare to both the petitioner and respondent and is not an offset.  2) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. However, the petitioner suggests that $200 is sufficient amount to overcome any shortfall in the respondent's present budget or needs. On the other hand, the respondent urges that the economic disparity in household incomes and post-separation lifestyles leaves her with a need for $750."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence. The Court held that the evidence of his ability to operate a motor vehicle while impaired was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving and that his eyes were glassy or glassy. The court also held that there was a breach of the accused's rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.  1)In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the accused was not found guilty. 2)The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy were not reliable indicators of impairment. 3)The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights. However, thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. The officer noted that the accused appeared to be asleep when he grabbed him by the wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. 4)The Court found that the officer's observations did not provide sufficient evidence for the breath demand. 5)In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to a person's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before a conviction can be registered. Accordingly, before convicting an accused of the impaired driving, the trial must be sure that he's able to operate the motor vehicle. Therefore, the evidence must be sufficient to establish reasonable or probable grounds. 6)The accused is not guilty."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This was an interim application to vary the terms of a 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements. The parties separated in 1999 after six years of marriage. They have two children: Maclean, now aged 11, and Kaylee, now 9. Both parents have shared, joint custody, care and control of the Children of the Marriage. The children have been placed in the primary care and custody of their father, Greg Patterson. The assessment report was completed in 2005 and there were thirteen recommendations, most fundamental being that the children be placed in their father's custody. All other recommendations were to be implemented at the very earliest opportunity. The mother wishes to continue with the shared parenting arrangement, but prefers that the three days on-four days off arrangement be the practice."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. The appellant contends the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The conviction appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed is varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in such circumstances. The focus of sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is balancing conflicting principles to arrive at a sentence tailored to the individual circumstances. Given the circumstances, the appellant has the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice.  2) The appellant has failed to establish there is any reasonable basis upon which to question the appellant's credibility assessment of the former babysitter, which is in fact corroborated by other evidence leading up to the critical event, including the events afterwards when she's seen leaving the house by the accused's siblings. 3) Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that denunciation and deterrence must take paramount importance, an appellate court may only interfere with a sentence simply because it would have imposed a different sentence. 4) The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Worm. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1979] SCR 759 at 414 Sask 184. 5) The Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and found the sentencing judge committed an error in principle when he rejected the evidence of the complainant's parents and siblings that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and that she never went into the bedroom. The Court was of the opinion his minimal reliance on the ex-babysitter's evidence to assess her condition after the offence had no meaningful impact on the verdict."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman who lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with Mrs. Essex Essex. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was of the opinion that the respondent was acting out of concern for the applicant. He was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to manage it. 2)The court found that the applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for the appointment as property guardian. The court ordered that the application be made within 45 days. 3)The application was adjourned for 45 days to allow the respondent to bring an application backable within the 45 days prescribed by s. 34 of the Trustee Act. 4)The Court found that it was in the best interests of the applicant that the land be vested directly in his name.  5)The respondent was to appoint the applicant's property guardian as part of the vesting order.  6)The public trustee was to be appointed property guardian under s. 87 of the Land Titles Act."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of the Court of Appeal granting leave to the father to adduce fresh evidence in relation to his fitness to parent the child.

This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The father appealed the order. HELD: Leave was granted or withheld on considerations of merit and importance. There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c.

The result favoured joining the federation.  2) The applicant was not a party to the referendum. He was a former director. 3) Although there is no definition of an 'election' in the Act, the respondents argue that a plain and usual reading of s. 135 would confine the ambit of the word 'election to that of an election of director or auditor. They suggest that it would be an error, and clear misreading of the section, to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by a non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. 4) The respondent was given the task of ratifying the CFS membership referendum results.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the defendant can deduct any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. The cross-exam is to be deducted the amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant. This does not include the Saxby account which predated the transfer of the business. Equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff’s cross examination of the defendants’ witnesses. HELD: The plaintiff remains entitled to notice to March 31, 1999, at her salary at the beginning of the work day, with no one speaking to her and no one giving her any tasks to perform. 1) The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal but acts of the employer which constitute constructive dismissal entitle the employee to withdraw her services without reduction of the period of notice. 2) The plaintiff appears to be a clever person but not necessarily flexible in her acceptance of the new owners.

The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's mother's ex-boyfriend. During the latter good relationship, the complainant would often sleep over with the accused and she would often report that the accused had touched her in her vaginal area. The accused testified that the complainant felt something inside her pyjamas and that she felt something touching her. HELD: The accused was not guilty as charged. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the complainant appeared somewhat casual, impersonal, scripted and lacked background details such as bodily sensations as one might expect from someone who experienced the ordeal would know about. Although the complainant testified that she could feel something while asleep, she could not, without doubt, state that in reality, what she experienced was the accused actually touching her vagina with his hands.

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The appellant appealed the November 2004 decision refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the chambers judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the child's loss of her possible relationship with and support from her father. The chambers judge agreed with the appellant that there had been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as result of the interplay between s. 67(1)(f) and s. 74(3) of the Act because he had not had contact with the child or provided support to her. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The facts were scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The child's father had not consented. 2)The chambers judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the adoption would have on her relationship with her father against the loss to the child of possible relationship, support and inheritance. The Minister chose not to intervene or take any position on the appeal.  3)This type of balancing test for determining the best interests of the child in the context of adoption was approved by Wolfe v. Cherrett (1978), 1978 CanLII 2149 (28 N.S.R. (2d) 17 at page 29 where the issue was whether it was in the best interest of the children to dispense with the consent of biological parent in a step-parent proposed adoption: 40 must respectfully conclude that the learned trial judge failed to ask the right question, namely, would the child derive material net gain in welfare if the father were permanently cut off? Not having asked this question, he did not identify and weigh the factors which should be considered in answering that question."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","A consignee was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The only benefit that Triple R received was the opportunity to perform repair work for reward upon the consigned vehicles. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff was not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it was possible, in that he had obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he incurred for repair and inspection. Triple R did not establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the plaintiff ceratin warranties to the extent that they were reasonable for the use of the product. 2)In the circumstances, the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. 3)The court found support for the notion that persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser. In the circumstances the actions of the plaintiff must be considered by Triple R. 4)The Court found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection, being $146.30 and $96.05, totalling $242, were properly recoverable."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The sisters apply for a partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The parties inherited the property from their mother after her death in 1996. They are now separated. The respondent, who no longer resides at the next door property, says that as result of the separation it may have to be sold. The Respondents acknowledge that the respondent, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, contribute approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. HELD: The application will be allowed. 1) There is no reason in law or justice for the defendant's retention of the benefit conferred by the plaintiff, making its retention 'unjust' in the circumstances of the case. 2) There are numerous authorities for the proposition that a joint tenant has prima facie right to partition or sale at any time. The court has discretion to refuse partition, but this discretion is'severely limited': see Bergen v. Bergen (1969), 1969 CanLII 1071 (BC), 68 W.W.R. 196 (B.C.), and the cases therein referred to. The plaintiff must come into court 'with clean hands': McGeer v. Green (1960), 20 Gr. 221; Pascoe v. Swan (1859), 27 Beav. 508, at 779. 3) In seeking partition, the plaintiff must not be motivated by malice, or by desire to be vexatious or oppressive. In partition cases, the word 'oppressive' means 'oppressive economically'. 4) The Court must be able to look to all of the circumstances relating to the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 5) When applying the Act the equities that might result in an unequal division of the sale proceeds are taken into account after the sale and are not used to determine the ownership interest of the title holder opposing partition and s. 6."
b_1996canlii6803.txt,"A claim for wrongful dismissal. The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","This was a claim for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute, from January 1983 to May 1993 at which time she was dismissed. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. She took all reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, including turning down an offer from another company for a new and experimental position. She turned it down because the position was too risky and the duties were materially different from those at her previous employer. The defendant was not obligated to accept the offer for the position. For the period of 9 months, the court assessed her damages at $26,514.93 and awarded pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-Judgment Interest Act."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants opposed each of the requests on the basis that they were inappropriate in light of the overall context of the litigation. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares' nor does it allege that the defendant has any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares. 2)The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated in s.34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. 3)The affidavit of the plaintiff deposed positively to the facts in question, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. 4)There was no evidence before the Court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is insolvent as required by s. 34(2). 5)The affidavits of the defendants were examined and the court was of the view that s34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained therein. 6)In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the corporate defendant has a good defence to, or ought to be permitted to defend, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares."

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares of Action Business Machines Limited (ABM). The trial judge awarded direct damages of $1,700,000 representing lost return on alternative investment of $2,000,000 at 10% per annum for seven years. This was the first time the trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the appellant should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements of ABM been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test. The first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at future date. The second approach is to fix the damages so as to put the appellant as far as possible in his position as he would have been had he not invested in ABM. In particular, the damages are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the ABM was less than what the appellant paid for it."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property pursuant to the provisions of The Matrimonial Property Act and maintenance for the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act. HELD: 1)The respondent abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have.

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The applicant sister of the deceased testator sought a hearing to prove his last will and testament in solemn form for the purpose of determining whether the will was brought about by the exertion of undue influence on the testator by the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed.

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was 61 years old and lived in Labrador. He had two prior convictions for assault and a persistent problem with alcohol. The only evidence in respect of the accused's relationship with the complainant was from the trial. There was no evidence that the accused abused the complainant's spouse or common-law partner. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused as a low risk to re-offend and imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment with a 10 year conditional sentence. The court found that the offender's record established a pattern of sexual assaults and that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit.
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. The applicant applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure to him.

The Crown is doing what it can to prevent the improper use of sensitive material necessary to the prosecution of a sexual assault case. 2)The Court found that placing conditions on disclosure did not constitute failure to disclose and an infringement of s. s. of Charter rights. The Court of Appeal held that the trust conditions sought to be imposed by the Crown in this case were reasonable and strike a balance between the right to disclosure and the rights of alleged victims, it being recognized that the right of fair trial is paramount. 3)The applicant was able to review and study the complainant statements, written and videotaped, on his own and away from the office of counsel, and his right to utilize them as claimed, are not essential to provide disclosure and to provide a full answer and defence."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips Co. lawyers should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The sole issue is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips Co.'s law firm are ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against a former client in the same or any related matter. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless the solicitor satisfies the court that he or she is seeking to continue on with the client. 2) There is an obvious conflict of interests which requires court intervention in the interests of the broader administration of justice. 3) The court reviewed the Alberta case of Jeffers v. Calico Compression Systems, 2002 ABQB 72 where numerous indicia of solicitor-client relationship were discussed. It was hard to fathom that information imparted to the former client was purely procedural and benign in nature and not ultimately relevant to the suit commenced one year later by the defendant."

The defendant did not call evidence to rebut Mr. Yuen's findings and the plaintiff's own version of events. When the plaintiff returned from his grandmother's house to have them call the fire department, he was found not to have suffered any symptoms of heat or was suffering from heat related to the smoke inhalation.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not met the onus of establishing the plaintiff should have her prima facie entitlement to a jury trial denied. Any preliminary findings made by the plaintiff do not diminish or encroach on the jurisdiction of the trial judge to determine at any point of time whether the case or parts of it should be put to the jury. The failure to move to strike in timely fashion does not impact on the question of whether the jury notice should be struck. 2)The delay in filing the notice to strike was not sufficient to establish that the plaintiff was entitled to jury notice. There was a series of Ontario Superior Court decisions indicating such an issue was not 'appropriate' for jury trial. The trial judge may, in rare cases, take all or part of a trial from the jury after its commencement. Nevertheless, timely motions should be made and not left until the eve of trial where such could easily have been advanced for some considerable time. 3)The plaintiff failed to give any or sufficient weight to the vital factor of whether there was just cause for the appellant's dismissal.

Put another way, the creditors are not entitled to benefit from that which bankrupt receives to make whole her injured body, mind or reputation. 2)There are other ways either under the BIA or under the Civil Procedure Rules whereby this information might have been obtained and possibly may now be addressed."
d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction to prevent the opening of a competing drug store in the city of Berwick. Salsman had resigned and the opening was imminent. The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. HELD: The motion was granted. 1)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company - the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test. The balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. 2)The hearing of the Interlocutory Injunction should be full and consider all of the evidence. The impending and imminent opening of the new business satisfies the requirement that of 41.04 2 (c) that urgency exists and cannot await the determination of the motion for a motion. It is obvious that once that new business opens, the effect upon the Plaintiff company will be profound and there is really no going back."

HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. The court found that the originating notice did not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v.

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the accused's GiO cycle was a motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The Crown had failed to prove on February 26, 2010 that the accused was operating motor vehicle on the evening of February 26. However, acquitting him of the charges of operating a vehicle while impaired and driving while disqualified, the Court held that the Crown had not proven on all of the evidence that there were pedals on the accused’s bike and that the electric motor was operable. 2) The accused had not demonstrated that his bike was drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than muscular power. His breath registered a fail result on the breathalyser. 3) The court was unable to decide whom to believe as to whether the bikes were pedals, whether there were electric motors on the bike, whether the electric motors were operable and 4) Whether the accused had a licence to operate the bike. The Crown was also unable to prove that the motor vehicle was motor vehicle. The accused should be acquitted of the charge of impaired driving."

The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.S. 1996, c.19 and the Criminal Code, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals have been in custody since November 17, 2004. HELD: The accused were released on a recognizance.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the accused was acquitted of both charges. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge found the accused's suspicion was not reasonable and there being no other reason for detaining him, there was a violation of his rights under s. and s. of the Charter. The trial judge excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician from the appeal. 2)The Court reviewed the meaning of the s. 24(2) Charter remedy and found that the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the officer to make an approved screening device demand on the accused. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. The Court reviewed R. v. Gunn, 2012 SKCA 80 (CanLII), albeit in the context of a demand pursuant to s24(2)."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT.

HELD: 1)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher when acting within the scope of s.228 of the Education Act. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 2)In the event the teacher is not liable, the school board is only liable to the same extent as the driver. That is, Edith Larsen's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in November 2002 for retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent ultimately countered with an application for variation to this court in March 2004. She also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. Variation of On-going Support for Kimberly [1] This matter is largely because the parties cannot agree on the method of calculating the respondent's income for child support purposes. The parties agree that much of his income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. However, given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of Mr. Marzolf's post-separation income (including his 2003 income) it would be imprudent, even if the parties were together, to enhance Kimberley's standard of living on the basis of a percentage of her father's 2003 income."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a decision of the Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal (the Board) dated October 25, 1996. It was limited to a question as to jurisdiction as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal as per oral reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Roscoe and Cromwell, JJ.A., concurring.

3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues.

The quantum of his claim was accordingly dismissed.  2)The father's initial mortgage of his land to the Bank of Montreal was not to secure a loan to the plaintiff. Nor did the father redeem the bank mortgage to salvage his land nor remortgage it to raise the funds required to discharge a bank mortgage from his land. There was conflicting evidence as to most of the components making up the damage claim for what could reasonably have been realized in 1994 from Canola crop grown on the land, including yield, quality, sale price and the costs of putting the crop in and taking it off. However once he learned that he, unlike most of his brothers and sisters, were not included in his estate, he felt entitled to some compensation for his labour. His labour claim was quantum meruit. The fact that the father did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land on his behalf does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease.

2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","HELD: The Court found that the children were at risk if placed in the primary care and control of their father. The father was not presently providing the physical amenities of life for the children. His type of parenting fell very short of the expectations of the court. The mother had made numerous mistakes in her past as a parent and the father was unable to provide adequate support to the children, particularly in the face of ongoing problems with their mental health.

The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have received had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the defendant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Legislature had denied such a claim and provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. The deceased's estate was entitled to claim damages for the loss of his future earning capacity and were recoverable in the survival action. The appellants appealed. The Court held that the legislature had denied the appellants the right to sue for loss of expectation of life and that the only significant claim under the survival of actions legislation was under the Fatal Injuries Act, which excluded causes of action which would have entitled the injured party to sue had he been killed."

She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to filing the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and made several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior. Included in the interim orders were interim orders giving access, child support and spousal support. As well an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property, subject to accounting at a later date. HELD: The application for stay is dismissed. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of such an order obtained after trial. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice. 2) With respect to the secondary test, it is submitted that there are exceptional circumstances making it just and fit that the stay be granted. The appellant says the jurisdictional uncertainties and the child's best interests present exceptional circumstances."

HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001.

3_1996canlii6774.txt,"Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The two doctors were both physicians and had been practicing medicine together in Wolseley since 1973. They had seven children, five of whom were 18 years of age or older and were studying for undergraduate or post-graduate university degrees. The trustee determined that as a condition of discharge, the doctors should make monthly payments of $1,250 per month for a total of 36 months. HELD: 1)The consent judgment option under ss.172(2)(c) of the Act was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve.  2)The doctors were 51 and 49 years old respectively. They were married for 12 years and had 7 children. Their combined medical earnings averaged about $18,000 per month and the expected after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. There was no reason why this income level could not be maintained. Based on Revenue Canada's Superintendents Guideline of Payments (which I take into account along with all other factors), this monthly family income after tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $3,349 for the benefit of creditors. 3)The trustee should apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time to the sole unsecured creditor, Revenue Canada."

The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. Both parties made a formal offer to settle on May 25, 2007 in the amount of $60,800 ($60,000 plus HST). This offer was not accepted by the plaintiff and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial; the defendant sought $10,045 in trial costs, $850 in disbursements and prejudgment interest of $5,643.24 for total of $26,630.81. HELD: 1) There was no clear winner in this case. In fact this is one of those cases where success and failure are shared almost equally. The in-floor radiant heating system was successful on deficiencies, aspects of the septic system, exterior wall insulation and various other smaller items. Additionally, the plaintiff was fully successful on the counterclaim. 2) There were problems associated with the construction of this home where the parties contributed materially. This was clearly the case with deficiencies. Force Construction Limited were often sloppy in their construction. Ms. Campbell refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There was also an element of this joint contribution in relation to septic."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.",HELD: The Court found that the defects in the open web steel joists manufactured by the defendant were real and substantial danger to the occupants of the Mayflower Mall.

This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT. In early 2008, a major Saskatchewan hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns. Within a year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. The applicant, Titan, each acquired several pig-barns formerly owned by Stomp Pork Farm Ltd. at various locations in Saskatchewan. These acquisitions were financed for the respective purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National) as a third mortgagee. In issue was whether the defendant was entitled to plead equitable set-off. The court referred to Rule 104A(1)(c) relating to set-offs and dismissed the application on the basis that the defendant's cross-claim was so closely connected with the plaintiff's demand that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking into account National's defences. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases and where the court is satisfied the claim is devoid all merit. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. 2) National has raised reasonable defences including: breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present; National has the right to defend the actions because of its interest in the equity of redemption; there is no basis to imply improper motives. 3) In the meantime FCC as first mortgagee has had to cover substantial ongoing expenses to maintain and attempt to preserve the value of the vacant barns"

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff had purchased the equipment from Ritchie Bros. for a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. The defendants advertised the auction as a farm dispersal auction, and the plaintiff's impending retirement was considered sufficiently noteworthy to merit special mention in the sale fliers under the heading 'Auctioneer's Note'. What constitutes bid indirectly on an owner's behalf or for his benefit is a far more elusive question. 3) The defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc. (the plaintiff's former employer). 4) The plaintiff consigned his farm equipment for sale to the highest bidder at the auction. It was not known to the defendants that it was being offered by the plaintiff. 5) There was little in the way of communication between the plaintiff and the defendants after December 23, 2003 when the plaintiff first approached to become a potential customer. 6) There were also some issues of breach of contract, as the plaintiff had not been paid in full. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion was that it had included the full sale price of the equipment when it calculated the gross sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. 7) In the meantime, the plaintiff was attempting to establish itself as a regional presence in the region. The court reviewed the contractual negotiations between the defendant and plaintiff and concluded that they were in breach of the contract. 8) The court was not satisfied with the defendant’s explanation of why the plaintiff bid on the equipment and the court was unable to determine whether it was offered directly or indirectly by the defendant."
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondents did not rely for their claim of privilege exclusively upon the confidentiality of the professional relationship between the accountant and client. They were prepared to disclose those documents in the possession of the accounting firm, including those that were created in the context of the accountant's professional responsibility to the client. This role was not inconsistent with the client's personal presence or involvement in these communications. Whether or not he is personally present, the client relies upon the accountant to accurately convey certain information within his expertise about the clients' affairs to the solicitor and to receive and implement the solicitor's advice on behalf of the client, even absent the anticipated litigation. 2)The solicitor and client privilege extended to communications to or from third parties to the extent that the third party could be seen to be acting as a client's agent or representative for the purpose of seeking legal advice from the solicitor. The central issue in this application is whether and to what extent solicitor- client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the clients.  3)The accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant for obtaining legal advice that the appellant was privileged from production, or giving evidence as to the contents of a letter written by the accountant as part of the process of obtaining such advice. The solicitor was entitled to privilege against producing a memorandum of what occurred at that meeting. The same privilege extends to answering any questions as to what was or is contained in that memorandum."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had been panhandling with his companion when he was approached by the accused, who was intoxicated and had a knife in his hand. During the confrontation, the accused threw the knife at the complainant and the complainant. The complainant confronted the accused in the parking lot and chased him to his vehicle, where he slashed the complainant's tire on the complainant’s car and then ran away, leaving the complainant to fend for himself in the back alley. When the complainant ran, the complainant grabbed the knife and threw it at him, striking the complainant in the face and causing him to fall backwards into the alleyway. The victim was injured in the confrontation and the accused was arrested. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial, including a security officer who testified that the accused threatened to apply force to him and that the complainant believed the accused had the present ability to use a weapon. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and the Crown had established that self-defence was not applicable in all of the circumstances established by the evidence given in this case.  1)The accused admitted to the fact that he walked up to the complainant, in close quarters, as the complainant did not touch him. 2)The complainant testified that he was frightened when the accused said something to him that caused him to become upset, go to his dufflebag, retrieve the knife in it (it was 15 inches long and the blade 10 inches), and pursue him as he left, could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against him, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s. 34(2)(b). 3)The Crown called the accused to give his evidence. The evidence of these witnesses, which will now review, provided the facts and circumstances applicable to reach the appropriate legal result."
6_1994canlii4677.txt,"38 year old truck driver with no previous criminal record was found guilty of assault contrary to ss.267(1)(b) of the Code. He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months.An altercation took place after his spouse's former husband had threatened his spouse and her children. He was dismissed from his employment as a truck driver immediately after his conviction because he could not gain entry into the United States, because he now had a criminal record. HELD: Conviction set aside; absolute discharge granted.","The appellant appeals the sentence imposed by the trial judge after a trial where he was found guilty of assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Code. He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. The appellant is 38 years old and was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and the uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment. He appealed the finding of guilt and made a request to substitute discharge for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is convicted of an offence other than an offence for which minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by life imprisonment, the court may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order. Thus the issue here is whether it is in the interests of both parties and not against the Public Interest to order an absolute discharge. It is clear the appellant may appeal the finding in guilt and make the request for substitute discharge, but there is no evidence to support this. 2)The appellant is not a person requiring personal deterrence and rehabilitation through the use of correctional facilities or treatment centres is not factor. He is person of good character who made an error in judgment. The offence is not one that requires an element of general deterrence to deter others."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appealed an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal was brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The cardiologist had been previously the subject of a competency review ordered by the College of Physicians and Surgeons and was found to be competent to conduct cardiology practice. He had attempted to reduce the limits placed on cardiologists by developing a clinic with staff and diagnostic equipment that was equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital. Many of the tests performed by the cardiologist in his clinic were not reflected in the comparative statistics. He challenged the reliability of these statistics as a fair and meaningful indicator of comparative patient costs. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Committee gave lengthy written comments to the appellant. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been approved by the Committee, they were not inadequate as alleged and do not constitute breach of natural justice. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias in the Committee's decision-making process. It was necessary to deal with each of the four grounds identified by the case law.  3) The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","Wacky's commenced proceedings against Maritime, Jollymore and Joseph. The issues were: 1) did Wacky's have a contract with Maritime; 2) were Jollymore or Maritime agents of Joseph; 3) was there a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, but not conferred 'officiously'. Wacky was not paid for flooring materials amounting to value of $18,601.55 that had been ordered from and provided by Jollymore; and 4) was Joseph unjustly enriched by the defendant's. The Adjudicator did find that the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment.

8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant was awarded costs under Double Column V in the usual way. The issue was whether the trial judge erred in law in finding that the joint bank and investment accounts were subject to resulting trust in favour of the estate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not mention the possibility of an 'express trust' for the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The evidence of the intentions of the deceased with respect to the funds in question was conflicting. Every single witness said something different about the intention of Ms. Little. There was also evidence as to gifts inter-vivos of money the deceased intended to make to the granddaughters but did not due to change of mind. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error. 2) The appellant was allowed to raise and argue issues one and three since they were not raised, argued, or dealt with in the court below. It is trite law that judge can accept part of the evidence of witness and reject another part. This is an issue of fact respecting the credibility of the court and this Court can interfere only in the presence of a palpable error. Section 75 does not speak to them."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act. They each brought variation applications under the Act relating primarily to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the parties would pay child support in the amount of $3,100 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program. The divorce took place in April 2004. The children have been drawn into ongoing legal proceedings between the parties. HELD: The application to vary child support was dismissed. 1)The parties have made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. There are three children: William, who is 23 years old, and April (who is approaching 14), who are both in the custody of the mother. The mother's current income is $12,759.73 US per month which is an annual income of $153,116.76 US or $203,706.74 Can. (On current conversion rate of 1.3304) based on the financial information before the court. 2)The mother has not met that onus. There is no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would, had it been known at the time of the original order, resulted in a different order of support. 3)There is no evidence of her seeking employment apart from her pursuing the establishment and funding for AWEDANS. However laudable this proposed organization may be there is no reason for Mr. Luke to fund its establishment. Ms. Luke is responsible for her own choices. 4)If the result is that he has underpaid he will pay the amount to whomever that top up is owed to within two months of February 15. If he has overpaid it will be 'clawed back' again, from whomever 'owes' him monies over 3 month payment period. 5)The father's income is based on current income which means his support is based upon current income. This is fair and as accurate as possible."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","The applicant suffers from chronic back pain and muscle spasms as result of work related injuries. The respondent concedes the applicant is entitled to compensation under the Workers' Compensation Act. The applicant argues that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. Therefore, even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is an appropriate standard of review for this matter as well. 2) There is no evidence the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana is a 'necessary' or'required' medical aid' under s. 106(1). The Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. 3) There was no evidence that the board made its decision based on considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marijuana. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana was potentially unsafe and unproven. 4) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions the Board is interpreting and applying the Act. There are no issues of general legal importance."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. HELD: Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. 1) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The Court held that in all the circumstances the Defendant was only 20 responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions.  2) Apportionment of damages. The Plaintiffs were awarded the sum of $7,500.00. The amount of damages awarded was reduced to $8,500 from $9,500 due to the defendant's failure to disclose that the equipment was water resistant. The quantum of damages was also reduced by the amount of mitigation awarded. The court also held that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs were nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. The defendant was only 10% responsible for damages sustained."

9_2014skqb60.txt,Criminal Law – Home Invasion – Sentencing HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault. He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"The accused were each found guilty, by jury, of breaking and entering the complainant's home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The accused were convicted as charged as principal and/or as a party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The jury found that the accused was not the perpetrator of the crime. The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration because of parole violations. The court was also to be guided by the principles set out in s. 718.2 of the Code.  1) In a jury trial, the jury does not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction. The sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence in the case. 2) The accused has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. He has, by my count, 67 previous convictions. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. The offender was also found to be a principal or party in the aggravated assault on the complainant. The Court was to take into account the factors that the jury had identified as essential to convicting the accused. 3) The Court is to be bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict. The principles of parity in sentencing are set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] SCC 15, [2013] SKCA 27, 189 Sask. R. 190."

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and care or control contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until approximately 36 minutes later. The delay in arriving at the police station was attributed to the following: dealing with two suspects at the scene; the need to immobilize the vehicles; and completion of paper work for SGI. The police officer's educated guess must not supplant the rigorous and independent scrutiny demanded by the reasonable suspicion standard. A rudimentary, or even a perfunctory, perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the accused's video-taped interaction with the accused at the outset. The issue, as it pertains to reasonable suspicion, was glaringly apparent."

Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.",HELD: The Divorce Judgment was granted on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had lived separate and apart for more than a year. The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that the husband failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile. There were disadvantages related to its breakdown. The Court concluded that the wife was entitled to spousal assistance at separation and that such entitlement continues. Her financial needs and needs require such support. Her circumstances clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue.

After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","The court granted judgment against the defendants in the amount of the Admin Fees charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants.

The respondents objected to the request that SGI finalize judgment as contemplated by the above paragraphs. HELD: The court reserved the matter of costs when it reserved its decision on the appeals of the judgment. 1)The Court of Appeal would have to have jurisdiction to prohibit a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench from making any change to his or her own judgment even though the judge is not functus officio. 2)Rule 15(1) in the present factual situation is of no moment and the parties appear to have attributed to the stay imposed by Rule 15 (1) that is totally unwarranted. All further proceedings in the action, other than the appeal, would require an exercise of such authority to be 'proceeding' in an action. 3)The court of appeal would have jurisdiction at the same time as the appeals that have been undertaken. 4)SGI's detailed tracking of charges by the defendants should permit this mathematical calculation to be made."

The mother's application was dismissed with prejudice to any subsequent reliance on these events in the event of a future application for contempt.  1) In circumstances such as have arisen here, it is not necessarily the child who needs to be investigated, but the parents. These parents demonstrate little understanding of the effects of conflict on child. The child is merely reacting to the unpleasant behaviour of his two primary role models. Many problems would disappear if he had his mother's full permission to go. 2) It is one reason both parents are often requested to share transportation of child for access when there is a geographical separation. By involving the mother, it offers concrete example to the child that she supports the father's access. No four-year-old enjoys confinement in vehicle and if the father is responsible for all of the transportation he may be perceived as the villain. Children of this age do not switch gears easily. This can be assisted by having the child draw pictures for Dad, helping him pack his favourite articles and giving the child easily understandable information about when he is returning (two sleeps, three sleeps, etc.). None of this occurs here."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","The plaintiff commenced a libel action against the defendants alleging that they, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. (collectively the defendants). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had published the words complained of in several articles and that the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The plaintiff sought an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. The defendants opposed the request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the requested amendment. HELD: The plaintiff was found not negligent and exonerated. 1)The plaintiff was the successor to the plaintiff and was the owner of the StarPhoenix newspaper. 2)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, or any of them, were liable in defamation. 3)The defendants were aware of the existence of Dr. Graham's claim and were the current owners of the newspaper. 4)There were no errors in the statements of claim made by the plaintiff. The statement of claim was amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant. 5)The plaintiffs were not aware that the defendant was facing a defamation suit. 6)The court was not able to resolve the claim at mediation or pre-trial settlement conference and eventually the claim was set down for trial."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.

Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.

The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the reserve bid in judicial sale must also be brought by notice of application. This is the stage in the foreclosure proceeding to not only seek confirmation of the sale, but also to seek the court's direction on the payment of purchase monies, including costs.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The university applied for judicial review of the Arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The university's position was that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University of Saskatchewan Act and in particular Section 51. 2. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was correct. The standard of review applicable was correctness. The Faculty Association's position is that the president has the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee in s.51 of Act, which states the Board may act only on the president's recommendation. 2)The interpretation of the s.50 interpretation of S.51 by the arbitrators was correctness or reasonableness. 3)The parties agreed to lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents. 4)The university's interpretation would be that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act and the collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. It is easy to see that, in their common usage, these terms can overlap. However, this is statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. Whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship was best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of the Family Property Act and the distribution made by him."

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order.

The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof.  2) The Ministry has been down that road for six years with the child. It is not prepared to put this child at risk, in particular because of the parents' past history of domestic abuse and violence. 3) In making an assessment as to whether an order under s.37(1) is appropriate the court must do so on the basis of the evidence before it.

1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Pelech v. Richardson which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. The parties had entered into a settlement agreement in 1983 which provided for long term maintenance. The respondent had remarried and continued to reside in the matrimonial home. There had been defaults in making the maintenance payments. The appellant applied to vary the amount of support. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant had established that there had been radical change in the wife's financial circumstances and that there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The court's jurisdiction was not ousted and may be exercised where there was a radical change of circumstances."

It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent.

2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children: Carley, Stacey and Mandey. The parties separated in 2003 and the parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004 the petitioner moved to Alberta and the three children moved with the respondent. In 2005 the petitioner paid child support of $300 per month but he made no payment for the month of June. In 2006 the respondent moved to Medicine Hat, Alberta. The petitioner moved back to the respondent, but there was no variation in the order dated June 29, 2004. It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation be effected."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He had been committed to stand trial on the noted offence in Queen's Bench with Queen’s Bench justice sitting alone. At the preliminary inquiry, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined by the judge in her previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied for court appointed counsel in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as counsel for an accused. HELD: The application was dismissed. The accused was not persuaded that he had shown the requisite circumstance of being indigent. The court reviewed the financial situation of the accused and determined that he was probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court reviewed the factors that led to the conclusion that the accused was indigent and therefore not able to afford the costs of a court appointed lawyer. It was important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements."
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","HELD: The Court found in favour of the appellants and ordered the release of the report. The court found that the report was to be confidential and to be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of the physicians involved in the review. The appellants were to have their report reviewed by the Regional Hospital. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that it would be an independent review."

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The actual evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. HELD: The application proceeded by voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain Warrant to Search (ITO). The admissibility of this evidence was in issue. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s.8 Charter rights had been violated. The Court reviewed the sufficiency of warrant application and concluded that the Crown could adduce evidence to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered. There was no dispute taken by the Crown to the procedure employed by the accused in this regard.
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The application was sequel to an earlier fiat rendered by the defendant on June 1, 1999 with respect to an application to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the court found the proposed amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff to the action on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of one year had intervened. HELD: 1)The application was allowed. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, the Court considered it an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow them.  2)The applicant was a joint owner of the property and should have been included in the original action. The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. 3)The amendments were made to show that the claim asserted by the new parties or by or against the new party arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim. No evidence had been lost. The basement is available for inspection. Any consultant hired by the defendants is in an equally good position to investigate as was the applicants' consultant and offer an opinion on cause and remedy. 4)The applicants met the requirements of s.44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted and the amendments were allowed.  5)The defendant was now in a position to conduct an investigation and it had the benefit of the reports provided to it by the applicants. The applicant did not file a statement of defence nor did it file an intent to defend.  6)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence. The delay is maximum of little over 3 years as in this case."
e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police Service to enter the complainant's apartment to investigate whether the accused's children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The complainant kicked and hit the complainant. The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of The Child and Family Services Act. HELD: The Court held that the accused was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the complainant’s suite would be contrary to her section rights unless that entrance and search was determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. The Court concluded that the police officer did not have the legal authority to enter Ms. Bigsky‘s apartment and that he was not attempting to apprehend the children. Therefore, the Court concluded the officer had no lawful authority and his entry to her suite was contrary to his section rights.  1) The Court was of the view that the Parental Service Agreement could not give Ms. Buchanan an open ended authority to access her home without a warrant. The fact that the father had contact with her on this date did not alter that situation. 2) There was some debate as to the identity of the officer and the jurisdiction of the court. The Crown and the Ministry were in hot pursuit of an individual, and attempting to make the arrest. However, the fact that a worker had directed that the officer was not to have contact with the complainant does not alter the situation. 3) The court was also of the opinion that the parental service agreement gave the mother the right to enter her home and to search for the children, and that a warrant and judicial authorization to enter it would be required. 4) It was open to the Court to establish that the mother had a reasonable grounds to believe that the child was being harmful to the children and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of her having contact with them."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that the actions of the Defendant Renouf, who had cut down trees on the Claimants' property, were not criminal acts. The only issue was whether the Defendant Burrows became vicariously or jointly responsible when Mr. Renouf went on 'frolic of his own.' The Court allowed the costs as submitted on the basis that the case was a large one, and it had been met with a large Counterclaim which, though not seriously pursued, was nonetheless hanging over the heads of the claimants as they prepared for the trial. The Claimants were not content to limit their recovery to the Defendant. The claim against the Defendant was dismissed and the Court found the Defendant to be jointly liable."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused owned a dog, to wit, that without provocation attacks a person. The accused did not take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. The court imposed a fine of $200. HELD: The court accepted the accused's evidence as to the proximity of the dog and the actions of the animal to the complainant, but found that the presumption of non-provocation that's set out in s 135.2(1) applies. The Court also concluded that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the complainant. The appropriate fine in the circumstances was $200 and that's the fine imposed.  1)On the definition of attack, as understand it, that the evidence is not appropriate nor accurate in the context of an attack by an animal. Dogs do not go into battle, not in the ordinary sense of that word and consider that word to be a voluntary intention to be involved in some physically violent act. 2)The accused did nothing to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. 3)The evidence was that the dog was in close proximity, and was snarling and barking, but in that case she was inside of her residence. In the Court's opinion, the dog's actions might have justified requiring a hearing under the other section of The Urban Munipalities Act, which provides for determination as to whether a dog is dangerous or not, but the Crown proved on that basis that the offence was committed. 4)The court found that there were seven specific pieces of evidence that supported the Crown's conclusion that the defendant did not have reasonable steps."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","Appellant appeals decision of Smalls Claims Court. On May 18, 2010, the Adjudicator issued a decision against the Appellant in favour of the Respondent in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The Court found little merit to his argument that he knew nothing of the hearing date, the finding of fact that service had been effected does not result in a failure of natural justice as the court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant such an order. It therefore follows, that the court was entitled to issue a default judgment against him. The Appellants must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice. HELD: 1) In considering a person's right to be heard, it does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. 2) In this case the Court adopts the reasoning of Justice Warner and in particular that the Court must also view the respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to. 3) In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small Claims Court as it is in the Supreme Court.

e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The accused had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant, with whom he lived for several years. The complainant alleged that the accused touched her in a sexual manner and that he had fondled her and touched her on the genitals. The Crown argued that the relationship between the complainant and the accused was similar to that of a person under the age of 16 years. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four counts. 1)The accused's credibility was mixture of reliability and reliability (are they now accurately recalling matters they had proper opportunity to observe and commit to memory in the past?) and honesty (the accused was disinterested in the outcome of the case and did not favour any party over another). 2)The essential elements of the offence were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. 3)Criminal Code Section 151, ss 151, 152 265 and 271. Some of these sections changed over time. The wording was identical except that it was an offence in relation to 'a person under age 16 years'. 4)The Crown's position was that there was no direct evidence of the accused having anything to do with the placing of the camera in the bathroom. 5)There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any of the offences."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the adoption application was remitted to a judge of the Family Division. The court found that the appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. The child's birth mother had been the subject of a temporary guardianship order in Alberta. The order was terminated in favour of private guardianship by the respondents. Although the child had been in need of protective services in Alberta, the court was directed to dispense with the birth mother's consent on the basis that neither were in attendance, nor represented at the hearing."

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that it was appropriate to reinstate the caveat retroactively to the date of its removal. The respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned some $69,000 to the defendant on or about the 30th day of January 2001. The defendants deny that this transaction was loaned to the plaintiff and her then husband, and argue that in fact it was an investment by the defendant and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence of any loan to either of the defendants. The evidence of the plaintiff in cross-examination was that after discussions with her husband, it was felt that they should invest some more money into Kelly's business so that he could buy more vehicles. However, there was no written contracts or other written evidence of an agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. The only evidence that might suggest a transaction was a loan to the defendants was that some of the payments made by E & M were in excess of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by E&M for the loan. 2)The plaintiff's claim that she received a loan was moot. There was no direct payment from the plaintiff or the defendant. 3)There were subsequent transactions between plaintiff and M and at least one transaction where the plaintiff issued a further cheque of $9,000 for the purchase of another vehicle. There is no evidence that any direct payment was made. 4)If the advance was loan, how much is outstanding."

The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"HELD: The application for detailed disclosure prior to an extradition hearing was granted. The hearing must necessarily result in either committal under s. 29 of the Extradition Act or discharge under ss. 3. The motion was not prepared to award costs to the solicitor as requested by counsel for the Attorney General.  1)The applicant was entitled to disclosure only of materials relied upon by the requesting state to establish its prima facie case. He was not entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that a fair hearing would not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. 2)The motion on behalf of the applicant was without merit and was dismissed. 3)It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for the extradition hearing."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The questions were asked in relation to the cause and origin of the fire and whether certain documents referred to in the plaintiffs' statement as to documents and for which the plaintiffs claimed privilege were obtained from the City of Saskatoon. The plaintiffs were advised that the plaintiffs were not there when the fire first started. The court granted relief of such a general nature that the meaning of the order was uncertain. The defendants were not entitled to ask for expert opinion. Objection No. 7-P. 273, Line 2 to P. 461, Line 3: The plaintiffs' objection that the question was asking for the names of possible expert witnesses would seem to be borne out by the portion of the plaintiff's comments which were underlined. The plaintiff's objection was that the questions appeared to be asking for an expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question was too vague to answer. In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v. Board of Education). The defendants ought to ask specific questions, for example, whether the plaintiffs have any position that the detail outlined in that document is right, wrong or otherwise, and the plaintiffs are entitled to know what was in the wall where the Soprema was being applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was observable, such as what chemical change took place. In any event the defendants will have the opportunity to examine the city in the third party claim. 1) The court was asked what observations the question referred to. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to the question when reference is made to document. 2) The plaintiff cannot be said to be seeking facts when he asks for this information; he is seeking details of the appellant's investigation. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. The trial judge will eventually interpret the terms of the agreement."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction.  1) The offender has serious health problems. As a result of a congenital heart disease, he required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had stroke. As consequence, he has left a left-side paresthesia and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He appears to be at an age where his risk to reoffend can be expected to decline rapidly and that, therefore, his risk for re-offend violently will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his anger. 2) There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into s. 810 recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and attend drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He also had significant negative attitudes and on the basis of this factor, believed he was high risk to commit violent crimes in the future. He was also found to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and believed his potential for violent crimes was high. The Court was not at all sanguine regarding the offender's potential for success in such programming given his apparent denial of his culpability and lack of interest in most of the programming he had been ordered to attend."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The Christie case remains the controlling authority such that when applied to this case rejection of the defendants’ submission on the applicability and effect of ss. and 11 of the SFSA must follow. Alberta Ltd. directed to the Land qua farm land which could reasonably bring it within the statutory purpose of theSFSA as considered in Christie, supra, and in particular Part II. Section 2(1)(f) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act provides for protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. Section 4 of the Act clearly states that a person can make an application with respect to a mortgage on farm land, but does not include: minerals contained in, on or under that land; land used primarily for the purpose of extracting, processing, storing or transporting minerals; and 'farming' includes livestock raising, poultry raising, dairying, tillage of the soil, bee-keeping, fur farming or any other activity undertaken to produce primary agricultural produce and animals. The plaintiff was not a farmer but rather was a developer and the Land was not farm land but rather a development site. HELD: 1) The Christie decision was dismissed. 2) The court found that the Christie case had no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. The SFSA circa 1988-89 is said by them to have replaced, modified or reversed the legislative intention of providing farm land protection. 3) The proposed use of the land was recited in opposition to the application by the plaintiff for an order nisi for judicial sale and for declaration that the proceedings commenced are nullity pursuant to s. 11 of The Farm Land Security Act. 4) There was no evidence that the defendants had any interest in the land at the time the Christie action was brought. 5) The plaintiff had no obligation to pay into court any additional amount needed to attain a bid over the Land value. 6) The defendant was not the person mortgaging the land."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married and the family home was in Connecticut. The petitioner father brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act, 1996, S.S. 1996, c. I-10.11 (The 'Act'), for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The application was granted and the child was returned to the petitioner. The Court found that the petitioner did not consent to the respondent's prolonged absence and that it was appropriate to impose some sort of condition on the petitioner as the petitioner had demonstrated he had a right to custody and therefore met the obligation under Article 12 of the Convention."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the city's police forces into the Halifax regional municipality. The plaintiffs were not members of union but were subject to a working agreement established between the city and the plaintiff sergeants. The issues raised by the plaintiffs were the nature of the dispute, the extent to which it was, in substance, addressed by the legislation and the collective agreement; and the capacity of the scheme to afford effective redress. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that it had jurisdiction to deal with the matter of whether the Statement of Claim should be struck out or whether it was an exclusive mechanism for the resolution of the plaintiff's dispute. It held that, in the absence of an arbitration board, there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. It would appear that the parties did not contemplate demotions except under proceedings taken under the Police Act."
5_1991canlii4241.txt,"The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. It arose from a decision in Boyd Garland v. International Union of Operating Engineers, which was upheld on appeal. The Minister of Labour and Manpower had taken the position that there were only two methods by which a union could obtain bargaining rights for the employees, namely certification and voluntary recognition. Dismissing the matter, that the Minister was bound by any agreement made on its behalf. HELD: The Court found in accordance with the tests laid out in Morin v. Comite National that a Minister in exercising his powers, conferred upon him by statute, can only be controlled by a prerogative writ which will only issue if he acts unlawfully. Unlawful behavior by the Minister may be stated with sufficient accuracy to warrant an arbitrator."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties agreed to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The court found that the material change in circumstances did not satisfy the Court there had been any material change. The respondent's income was reduced and he was ordered not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without the petitioner's consent. The Court found that there had not been any change in the circumstances of the children since the consent judgement."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention was that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The plaintiff's action cannot succeed for the following reasons: a)The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions are given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town. 2)The court could not find on either the evidence or the back of the form that clear instruction were given by the defendant to disconnect water. To be sure, there was no signature required or obtained on the form. Neither did Ms. Isaac advise the power was being shut off."

Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm on the complainant. He had been employed in the construction industry for 23 years and had been for three months prior to the assault. The complainant had been drinking with his uncle when the assault occurred. He did not work for 3 months following the assault and was unable to work due to a broken arm and hand. He suffered lacerations to his face, head and arms and contusions to his upper arm and upper body. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a fine of $1,500 plus a $2,500 victim fine surcharge. The victim was to pay a $300 fine and a $500 victim impact surcharge to the court. HELD: The victim impact statement was admissible and the court was to rely on the facts of the offence, the severity of the injuries and the minor criminal record of the accused. The court was of the view that a fine plus a probation order with strict conditions could accomplish the principles of sentencing as outlined in s. 718. The principles of parity demand similar sentences in the circumstances."

Allowing the appeal and varying the sentence to nine months, that while perjury is a very serious offence, the sentence exceeded the range imposed for offences of this nature.","The appellant was charged with perjury at the preliminary hearing of a co-accused in a break, enter and theft case.

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of support for the children within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. 2)The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable directly to the petitioner for the purposes of the application. The court found that the amount payable by the respondent was $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses. Based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,781 and Ms. Strueby's 2006 income $90,628, the Guideline amount for the support of Keegan and Luke is $380 for the period of March 2003 to September 2007. 3)The child support arrears owing under the judgment of Justice Dielschneider dated February 28, 2000 were $10,587. It was well-settled that full time attendance in post-secondary education may result in a child over the age a majority qualifying as 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. However, the parties were at odds concerning all three children. The parties were in agreement that Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, was no longer a child of the marriage. The father sought an order for an orderly payment of the child support orders.  4)The application was adjourned until November 1, 2008 at which time the respondent will be ordered to pay $500 per month for child support as well as an additional sum of $100 for child care expenses and extracurricular activities until such time as the child is no longer eligible to pay child support in an appropriate fashion.  5)The father was to have paid $1,147 per month in child support since August 20, 2007 in respect to the maintenance order of February 28 2000.  6)The mother sought to have her child support ordered in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served. HELD: The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, taking into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and education. The Crown appealed the sentence, arguing that the sentence was unwarranted. The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to indicate that sentence of closed custody must be employed only rarely and in unusual circumstances. There was no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. After pleading guilty to the offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, he was sentenced to nine months time served, plus two years less one day conditional, including three months on electronic monitoring, plus 2 years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently.

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $12,500, $2,000, and $1,911.70 plus pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-Judgment Interest Act.  1) The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and reviewed the purposes of that Rule. 2) The Court reviewed the nature and scope of aggravated damages. They too compensate for intangible loss but in particular for hurt feelings caused by the nature of the defendant's conduct. The range of injured feelings will of course vary with the circumstances but it often embraces such emotion as humiliation, indignity, degradation, shame, indignation, and fear of repetition. This can be dealt with by elective surgery (which the plaintiff suffered for a number of months after the assault) or by dental treatment followed by crowns. The plaintiff had some minimal scarring and disfigurement but found that it was not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damages the court concluded that a fair award for general damages was $13,500. 3) The plaintiff did not plead case for punitive damages by alleging misconduct of the requisite nature, identifying the offending conduct of each of the defendants and asking for exemplary or punitive damages in consequence.  4) Each party contends that the cases relied upon by the other parties involved injuries that were not comparable to those sustained by the plaintiff in this case."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff had been constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff $19,200.00. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his termination. HELD: The plaintiff can rely on s. 33 of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off. The defendant then bears the onus of rebutting the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in LSA. The next preliminary issue to be determined is the period for which the plaintiff may make such a claim for holiday pay. The court should not appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance, as the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","HELD: The Court found that s.300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2(c) and s.11(d) of the Charter. The Court applied for relief under s.309 and 311 of the Code. Both accused plead not guilty to both counts. 1)The impugned legislative provision minimally impair the Charter right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by ss. 2(b). 2)There is proportionality to the legislation in that the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective. 3)The principles of free and democratic society both guarantee the rights in the Charter and, in appropriate circumstances, justify limitations upon those rights. 4)The Court must balance the limitation of s. 300 of the code in the context of the value of the common usage capable of interpretation and an intelligible standard of conduct. 5)To warrant prosecution the accused must be sufficiently serious to require the intervention of the Crown in the public interest. 6)Section 301 of the criminal code is a limit prescribed by law within s.7 of the Criminal Code. Section 298, 299 and 300 constitute a limitation prescribed by statute. The threshold test for the application was met. Section 611 and 612 of the S.300 Code create a reverse onus. The court must be guided by the values of freedom, dignity and respect for the human person."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on his truck while he was driving. The plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued. The action was brought against the Attorney General and the defendants as occupiers of the property on which the stump or trunk of the tree was located. The Attorney General did not consent to the discontinuation of the action. HELD: The Court held that in order to establish a duty of care in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty has been held to exist. It was also necessary to determine whether liability may be imposed upon the respondent.  1)There was no evidence that the tree fell due to DED but from Ganoderma applanatum, a fungus that was common on stumps but rare on the area of wound parasite. 2)The plaintiff as a user of the road was in sufficient proximity to the defendant to come within the purview of that duty of caring. 3)The Attorney General had no training or expertise in trees or tree diseases. He was unable to say that conks of this fungus were present at the time of the accident. 4)The defendant was awarded the sum of $10,000."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The hearing judge found that the income replacement benefit (IRB) for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. HELD: The respondent was not entitled to any more costs from SGI. 1)The hearing judge erred in holding that the respondent's IRB for the 180 day period was not to be less or greater than the amount paid by the respondent. The IRB calculation was based on the court's finding of facts and the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand was receiving.  2)SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the legislation [ss.117(4)]. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average' approach used by SGI, but that is too restrictive a definition of the phrase. Section 134 of the act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal."

The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","This was an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the respondent has abused a child as described in s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. It was for the purpose of entry of the respondent's name in the Child Abuse Register.

The Court also held that the accused had not committed a criminal offence.  1)The standard of proof is high, but not as high as the standard for proof in criminal cases, where the proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. 2)The Court adopted the position that the standard is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and its implications (considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt)."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement to provide for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day-to-day care. The parties separated in 1995 and have been married for 14 years. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders. The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. HELD: 1)The parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children.  2)The court was satisfied that all jurisdictional requirements had been met and that there had been a permanent breakdown of the marriage and therefore, a divorce judgment would be issued. The court was not satisfied that arrears, other than those that have already addressed, had been established in the evidence."

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp.

None of the solicitors appeared at the scheduled examinations. The defendants' solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations, claiming that he was not aware that judgment had been entered against him, or that he would need the 'appropriate conduct money' to proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it was eventually determined. The conduct of the defendants and their solicitor clearly indicates that in the same fashion as before the contempt proceedings were adjourned, they have continued to duck and weave, and have effectively stalled all reasonable attempts on the part of the plaintiff to proceed."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant and respondent union entered into a collective agreement in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments for each year. The employer sought payment of the lump sum. The union sued the employer for negligent misrepresentation. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)There was no determination by an arbitrator of whether the employer's claim was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. 2)There were several factual questions relevant to the issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25. 3)The Court was not in a position to decide whether the collective agreement was an ancillary document. The action was to be directed to arbitration. 4)The issue of whether a letter of July 22'd, 1994 was an adequate document to determine whether the matter was arbitrable. There were no others to be asserted in Court."
d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","Where an accused is charged with an offence under s. 151, 152, 153, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 346 or 347, the presiding judge or justice may make an order directing that the identity of the complainant or of witness and any information that could disclose the identity shall not be published in any document or broadcast in any way. The appellant appealed his convictions. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence we cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and accordingly the appeal is dismissed. 2)The appellant denied assaulting the complainants. The trial judge sentenced him to nine months imprisonment with respect to the assault on B.J.R. to be followed by two years probation. The sentence on the second count was 1 month consecutive."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10. The plaintiff claims that the October 2006 agreement referred to the wrong parcel of land and seeks rectification on the basis of mutual mistake. The other defendant, Mr. Sterling, is a beneficial owner of all the shares, assets and undertaking of Sterling Farm and was (it is alleged) party to the harvesting contract, along with Sterling Farm. The plaintiffs entered a formal Timber Cutting Agreement and Lease relating to the same property in 2006. While the plaintiff alleged that action was being taken to migrate the title of several properties owned by Sterling Farm, the defendant alleged that the action was preparatory to selling or otherwise encumbering said properties to put the same beyond the reach of his creditors. The defendant argued that the attachment order had hindered or prevented it from resuming operations. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause. The attachment order must be terminated.  The plaintiff was not satisfied that the plaintiff had established any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and the court is satisfied that its existence will hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The officers observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer'. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligram, respectively. HELD: The Certificate of Analysis was dismissed. 1)It is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. The use of certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. It is not possible to know who made the alteration consisting of the striking out of the word and symbol “Breathalyzer®” and the writing in of “3” which bears his initials. While it is probably the same person made the same alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. 2)The certificate is only a shortcut afforded the Crown by virtue of the fact that it is only afforded to it. If the Crown had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the approved instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. There was no evidence that the qualified technician states in the certificate that an approved instrument was employed. If Parliament had intended to change the expression of the year from 19 to 2003, it was bound by it."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, sought joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the parties based their October 2005 verbal agreement for child support on the petitioner's 2004 income and that the respondent refused to allow him parenting time if he '...did not agree to pay her the amount of child support she demanded''. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes.  2) The petitioner was not prepared on an interim basis to deduct the $9,600 from her 2006 income. Given the lack of financial disclosure by the petitioner, am not prepared to vary the terms of that agreement.  3) There was nothing in the evidence before the court sufficient to rebut that presumption. The court must be satisfied additional money is actually available and that it can be paid to the shareholders without endangering the financial viability of the company. The status of the children is of limited assistance. Retained earnings are shareholder's 'equity' in the corporation (its assets less its liabilities). They do not reflect the cash available for distribution. 4) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be in the cause."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the tenant's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy was declared to have not been converted.  1)The Landlord was entitled to make a reasonable business decision and not be second guessed by tenants, Residential Tenancy Officers or Adjudicators simply because they do not agree with the landlord. 2)The tenant had the advantage of the landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009). He would be exposed to the very financial risk that he seeks to avoid.  3)The landlord was directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. In the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The child was still a child of the marriage. She was employed full-time and the father was paying child support of $534 per month. 2)The father's income had increased since the May 2002 order. The mother's failure to terminate the father's contribution for her son's extracurricular activities was reprehensible. The father's obligation to contribute for his son's hockey, golf and baseball expenses was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 3)There was no evidence as to the reasonableness of the mother's position as to whether or not the father had received money from the father for this expense when it was not actually incurred. The evidence did not establish that the bingos were not split. 4)The mother was not entitled to the costs of the family law proceeding."

The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size.

Leave to appeal this ground is denied. The test on such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant.

2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. On the basis that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order was made (Wilson v. Grassick (1994), 1994 CanLII 4709 (SK CA), R.F.L. (4th) 291 (Sask. C.A.) cited with approval in Gordon v. Goertz), the court found that as no material change had been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. The father argued that the order should be changed because the oldest daughter at least wishes it to be changed and because she is a mature and thoughtful child for her age. The mother argued that there was concern from the assessor that at least the oldest child may be expressing wishes and desires that may not necessarily be hers but may be made by her in an attempt to express the mother's wishes or desires. HELD: 1)The court dismissed the application. As no change was demonstrated, it was dismissed with costs. 2)There was no evidence that at the time the court asked to change the child support order, as the mother in her affidavit material confirmed that she had commenced as of June 2007, to pay support based on her new income and as there was agreement between the parties, each from their own affidavit material, that that current support level should be $619 per month. There was no information before the court to suggest that this was no longer in the best interests of the children."

The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant sued the defendant for breaching a contract whereby the defendant agreed to custom seed some 1,050 acres for the plaintiff in exchange for a fixed price of $19,293.75. The defendant argued that the trial judge was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and had improperly interfered with the plaintiff's cross-examination of Knudsen's witnesses. The appeal judge rejected both lines of argument. He found that the judge's findings of fact had been reasonable and that trial judge had managed the trial fairly, patiently and efficiently. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant. There are some issues which could be issues of law but they are all so lacking in merit as to warrant the attention of the Court. 2)The defendant has a catalogue of complaints about the Queen's Bench. The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged the plaintiff from asking the same question multiple times. 3)The trial judge's language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias."

The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike the affidavits of Sonya Lorette, dated January 22nd, 2007 and February 9th, 2007.

After making that request there was a procedural breakdown between the Council and the Board with respect to how that hearing would proceed, with the Board seeking and being denied, an adjournment. The hearing then was held as scheduled without the participation of the Board. The affidavits were admissable to complete the records. The fairness of doing so was underscored by the fact that on the hearing of the board's application the court will have before it the affidavit of Merks which is to much the same effect as the one raised in Waverley. 3)The issue was whether affidavit evidence is admissible on an application for certiorari."

The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found that both parties had breached the contract and that the breach entitled the defendant to terminate the contract without notice. The defendant counterclaimed in negligent misstatement and breach of contract, and the trial judge awarded $270,307.05 to the appellant. The appellant argued that the defendant breached its contract by failing to provide the approximate tonnages and that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion of liability provisions in the contract. The court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss of profit and awarded $10,000 damages to Roper. Roper's appeal was directed primarily at the findings of fact. However, the judge did not make any reviewable error with respect to the facts. As for the plaintiff's damages, he dismissed all of them."
c_2017skqb388.txt,HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. Their grounds are that the respondent has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will he is presently an executor and he is refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1)The Court has the jurisdiction to remove an estate executor pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act.  2)The respondent is removed as an executrator in the grant of probate ordered by Gabrielson J. on July 20, 2016 and that Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall continue as executors pursuant to that grant.  3)There is no evidence before the Court that either of Kent or Rodney have acted contrary to their obligations to administer, the estate in accordance with the directions. Further, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly do their duty."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","FIAT: The plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs of $1,598.50. The defendant held funds seized under the enforcement proceedings following the entering of the default judgment, Sollows' counsel undertakes to request the Sheriff to continue to hold those funds pending a further order of the Court. HELD: The default judgment was set aside on the basis that the defendant had entered a judgment that was greater than the amount due. The plaintiff was entitled to apply to set aside that default judgment and seek leave to file a defence in the form of the draft filed with the court July 19, 2018. 1)The plaintiff failed to demonstrate an arguable defence to the claim. The time frame from March 22, 2016 to March 15, 2018 is a total of 723 days, not 725 days. 2)The time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollow's was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after it was entered, this delay in defending might constitute sufficient reason to deny the application. 3)The logic and the law relating to ostensible authority cannot supplant this clear statutory direction as to how and when band councillors are entitled to make decisions. To permit majority of Council to bind the Band on the principle of ostensible power when they have made a decision outside of Council meeting would be permitting a common law principle of contract law to supplant the express direction of Parliament."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as result of seizure of marijuana plants, the respondents alleged that their Charter rights under s. 8, to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure, had been violated. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The admission of the evidence would not affect the fairness of the trial. The evidence was excluded because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. The warrantless search was unreasonable. 2)The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S. 347 when it interpreted the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as providing protection 'of people, not places'. The court found that the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation that the evidence should be excluded because the search was conducted in an area accessible to the public. It is not necessary to determine if the searches were unreasonable and if so, whether the evidence warranted exclusion. 3)The trial judge placed the onus on the Crown to prove the accused were not acting in good faith because they relied on the apparent statutory authority in s. 10 of the narcotic control act and they had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that there were narcotics at the place searched."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at the residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The accused argued that the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict because the date of the offence was not proven, there was an error of law. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. 2)The evidence presented by the Crown was not sufficient to meet the required test, that is, whether there was any evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. 3)Given the circumstances in which the motion was made, including the argument advanced by defence counsel, it is fairly obvious that the defendant had failed to prove that the day of possession of the weapons was May 30, 2003 as alleged in the Information. However, in preliminary discussions with the judge, defence counsel agreed that the Crown must prove all the essential elements. The Crown need not prove elements which are, at most, incidental to the offence. The date of these offences was not an essential element."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The petitioner sought a divorce from the respondent as well as maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married for 10 years and had two children. The petitioner sought custody of the child. The respondent sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits. HELD: The Court granted the divorce on the grounds that the separation agreement was not in effect for a specified period of time and the petitioner was entitled to reasonable access upon reasonable notice.

In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the finding of inordinate and inexcusable delay. The defendant sought an order returning $40,000.00 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid and retained by the latter to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. HELD: The application for dismissal was granted. 1)The delay in advancing the action does not constitute an inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. 2)The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim does not reach the level of'serious prejudice' having regard to the factors considered in the ICC case. 3)The defendant was not entitled to recover the costs of its action."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues which were summarized as follows: 1) Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. He was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2) The Court found the accused was 'in care' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(1)(a). The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care and control of the vehicle. The Court concluded that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The accused failed to demonstrate his s.10(b)(c) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. The court held that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures, including head and neck trauma procedures. 4) The court concluded that there might not well exist circumstances, for instance, in which the accused might not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to a lawyer."

He is now facing additional allegations of breach.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s. 63 of The Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the ""Group Plan"") is not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The loan agreement creates a significant security interest in favour of Crown Life and the applicant. The provisions of s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply. 2)The taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes the provisions of the Plan Contract; and 3)the contravention of Article 8.03 renders the Loan Agreement illegal and unenforceable."

The petitioner wishes to move with the respondent from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. HELD: 1) The child's primary residence is with his mother so long as she remains in the City of Saskatoon. If she chooses to relocate, the petitioner will become an access parent and the children will no longer benefit from his co-parenting. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton the child is not in the best interests of the child.

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act permanently committing the three children of the Department to the Minister. Since the birth of the oldest child, the Department had been very much involved. The decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The Department had struggled for six years to overcome the dysfunction in this family and the risks to the children, without success. The children had been and accordingly continue to be in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act. The violence and disharmony was another symptom of being unable or unwilling to provide for the needs of the children."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: Custody was granted to the father with access to the mother. Access was to commence January 1, 1998. The mother was adamant that the custody and access assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. 1) The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. 2) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the children's unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. 3) There were numerous conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There was really very little involving the mother directly. The parties were involved in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and having regard in particular to the age and unwavering antagonism of the two eldest children, the father had made only one voluntary payment of $100 in January, 1998 and otherwise ignored the maintenance order until garnishees were implemented by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. He was to have access on his scheduled days off work. 4) There was no evidence that the father was seeking out disagreement, no matter how trivial. Only by hearing the tapes could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children."

The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.

It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","FIRE: The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operationand operated a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant recommended to the petitioner that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. Relying upon the accountant's advice, the petitioner brothers invested in these partnerships. Over the years, the parties have sustained heavy ongoing losses which have resulted in the need for significant injections of capital contributions to the Partnerships. The petitioner's business losses have always been allocated equally among the partners and claimed by each of the partners as personal business losses on an equal basis. As a result, the defaulting partners have obtained the benefits of the partnership (in the form of reduced income taxes resulting from business losses) without paying for them. HELD: 1)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court to refuse to issue the receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. No adequate explanation has been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven.  2)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. As I am satisfied that he has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they have becomedue. It is common ground that the respondent has paid nothing toward the partnership obligations since 1993. The facts relied upon by the Petitioners to prove indebtedness to them comprise the uncontroverted evidence as to the facts described above.  3)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Bankruptcy Court that the petitioner had committed an act of bankruptcy within 6 months prior to the filing of the petition."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. It also held that the court could not vary a final order on an interim basis pursuant to s.17. The Court reviewed the jurisprudence of the past 10 years and found that the courts lack the authority to vary final orders on a matter of jurisdiction, especially when it comes to child support orders."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.",HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of the first count of wilful damage to the car contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The second count was dismissed on the basis that the Crown and defence would be allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information which would all be applied over to the other information.
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the complainant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt as to guilt."

A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals the decision of Matheson J. confirming the second decision of a Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code.

An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody with the parties to allow them to deal with service issues. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since December 2012 when the petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z. with primary residence and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time.

b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers for the resale of these crops. To secure the product for resale, Johnson Seeds entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. Johnson Seeds attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: There was a valid contract between the plaintiff Seeds and Johnson Seeds. The contract was signed in May 1993 and both parties considered that there was a binding and legally enforceable contract. In addition to the fax, the plaintiff had used the mail to communicate the offer to Johnson Seeds and it should therefore have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully executed copy of the contract. There was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with Calcutt in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that in his view a contract did exist. This as well was confirmed by the defendant. The defendant agreed to pay for the said seed in one of the following ways: The defendant may charge directly to the Producer any excess cleaning charges arising from delivery of Canaryseed containing in excess of 20% foreign material or other seeds which require special cleaning. There is no doubt in the defendant's testimony about these discussions that the defendant verbally reaffirmed that it was very important that payment be received in early January 1994. This was not written into the contract and the defendant was not sufficiently careful to ensure that this term was there in print at the time he executed it."

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.",HELD: The Court found that the negligence and breach of contract claim was based on the defendant's failure to object to the admission of the videotape re-enactment and the opinions given by the R.C.M.P. analyst to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The Court held that the video evidence was not admissible and that the evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

SaskTel was awarded its costs. On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation."

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analyses, such evidence flowing from an approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s. 8 and s9 Charter rights. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1) The Certificate of Analysis was excluded. 2) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the body at the time of the ASD demand. 3) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol. 4) The absence of any reference to alcohol being detected on the breath in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues at least. 5) The officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before the court pursuant to s24(2). 6) There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that it did not find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act or pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act and that the petitioner had not engaged in blameworthy conduct.

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded a lump sum of $41,000 for the damage caused by the hip injury and $1,720 for general damages.  1)The plaintiff did not have a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. 2)The injuries were so severe that the plaintiff was unable to walk for several days at a time. 3)The court found that the injuries were separate and apart from the nonpecunia damage. 4)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff. 5)There was no evidence of the plaintiff's projected future income."

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"A low speed collision occurred in the turning lane at this location. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the driver's side and some denting on the trunk lid of the vehicle. The ultimate disagreement centered on the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with no order as to costs to either party.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced. The scales did not weigh persuasively in favour of either party based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. 2)The physical evidence, taken together with diagrams and photographs, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability in this case because it is, at the end of the day, equivocal – i.e. it could support either version of the events related to the court by the plaintiffs and the defendant respectively. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven. On this basis, as a matter of law, the plaintiff’s claim must be and is hereby dismissed.  4)The court was unable to conclude that either version was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contained an equally rational explanation for what transpired on the date in question."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She emphasized that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the court does not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant, they should also conclude that he was the driver of the Tempo. The appellant argued that, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict reached was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It appears that, at the time of the trial, Mr. Holoboff was not in good physical condition. The jury was alerted to them and were advised that the appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was Mr. Horkoff. 3) The Court was not persuaded that the judge's remarks would have unduly or unreasonably influenced the jury's decision to sentence the appellant to consecutive terms."
9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff, a municipal tax payer, paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the ""due dates"" in 1995 and 1996 inclusive. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination, which translated into the overpayment of taxes. Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the disposition of the appeal. The intention can be gained from the very terms or phrases in s41(i)(i) and the Judicator Act, which only apply where there is a proceeding for the recovery of debt or damages and it is a mischaracterization of the various levels of assessment appeals to suggest they are proceedings for recovery of debts or damages. HELD: There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. The date from which interest is calculated in this action to pursue Canada Trust's right to interest on the amount of the over payment is upon completion of the appeals process. Interest could be claimed under s40(i), supra from the time the tax payments were to be paid until disposition.  1)The Judicator's Act does not create debt. The Judicator has no right to refund of overpaid taxes until the end of any appeal of the assessment. It specifically and expressly requires the municipality to refund the amount overpaid and intentionally makes no mention in this or in any other section to paying interest on that overpayment. An appropriate interest claim does exist under s43(i). It does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the assessment payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded.  2)The date of payment for the refund of tax owing to Canada Trust was the date when it could be said to be a 'overpayment of tax' and the date of the payment of the property tax refund could not be determined until the disposition. 3)Canada Trust was under a direct mandatory statutory obligation, pursuant to ss. 90 and s. 90, supra to refund any amount over paid as soon as the appeal concluded."

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.",HELD: The accused was sentenced to eight years and six months in custody. Credit was given for time spent in custody and a credit of 4 years and 9 months. The global sentence was reduced to 8 years and 6 months. There were two separate schemes which were somewhat complex in their execution and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. The accused pleaded guilty. He had been in custody for two years and eleven months at the time of sentencing and had avoided lengthy trial and the consequent expense. He was given credit of four years and nine months and the global sentence reduced accordingly. The discretion to grant credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section.
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band which held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. The purpose of the Act is not to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that the innocent purchaser is protected provided he had no notice, whether the agreement complies with the Bills of Sale Act or not. 2)The assignment as such transferred to the plaintiff no rights in the choses in action which were recognised at common law. Its efficacy was based solely upon principles of equity, with the additional statutory right given to the assignee to bring action in his own name, instead of that of the assignor, against the debtor upon giving notice to the creditor. 3)The Court was of the opinion that under the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act an agreement which is not evidenced by writing and filed in compliance with section is void even against a party having notice (See Edwards v. Furniture Finance Corp., 1930 CanLII 426). 4)The appeal should be dismissed with costs if only on the simple ground that it was never in the contemplation of the parties to the assignment that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between Fagel and the defendant, should be affected by the subsequent assignment of the book debts."

The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire, the defendant moved to another location. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The plaintiff sought production of all documents relating to the second fire. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court awarded costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. The defendant submits the plaintiff has not established the documents are relevant to the present action. Rule 14.01 displaced the former semblance of relevancy test.

This raises the question as to whether she has sufficient resources to care for these children appropriately. Given all the circumstances of this case, it appears that Wright J. was of the view that the judgment roll 'vacates' the order of the judge. The immediate question is the effect of the order on the obligation to pay maintenance."

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Justice of the Peace on January 10, 2009. The warrant resulted in blood samples being taken from the accused. The Court was advised that the blood samples were subsequently analysed and the Crown would be seeking to have a Certificate of Analyst set out the concentration of alcohol and the accused's buttocks to be situated on the driver's side of the vehicle. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The information contained in the information to Obtain largely consists of boiler-plate. This is to be expected in such documents. The standard of review set out in Garofoli was affirmed in many subsequent cases including R. v. Morelli, [2005] S.C.R. 343. 2.The burden of proof rests upon the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize his blood samples was invalid and that there was an infringement of his rights as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter.  2)There was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant. There was a breach of the accused’s right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. As the accused was a section Charter right was breached, what is the appropriate action to be taken under s. 24(2)?"
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Family Court concerning a lump sum payment made under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges has been varied after payment. The issue before the court was whether such an order could be varied. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court. The general principles favouring the claim must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it. The case Gillis v. Soulis was not determinative of the issue as it did not deal with the issue of whether lump sum payments can be varied under the Family Maintenance Act. There is no power in the courts of Nova Scotia to vary such orders. They are unique creations of a particular statute, and the statute must govern. It is possible to arrive at this conclusion merely by considering the scheme of the Children's Unmarried Parent Act. However any lingering doubt is removed by s34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, is the successor legislation, 'this part shall not apply to any punitive father who has fulfilled the terms of any order made against him with respect to the same child under Part 1'."" 2)The court was unable to cite a case other than Ivey v. Muir in which lump sum orders under the old Children's unmarried parents Act have ever been varied before payment."

HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care. The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT. Both parents want sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy has lived alternating weeks with each parent. Both now say this arrangement does not work very well. HELD: 1)The father's obligation shall commence on the first day of the month following the time that the mother makes herself available for full-time parenting of the child. He earns $2,210 per month ($26,520 per year) and his obligation under the Federal Child SupportGuidelines is $226 per month. The mother asks the father to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for horse riding lessons. The father's proportionalshare of $28 per month is $28. 2)The parties had leave to apply for further directions. There was no order for costs."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and re-assessed her release on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Minister of Defence refused to grant her a pension under s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff filed a civil action based in tort against the Minister on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. 88 of the Liability and Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the authorities to amount to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she is now entitled to a pension. HELD: The plaintiff's proceeding was premature. It was impossible for the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. and s.111. It is inconceivable that the appellant is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time.  1)The Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff has never made an application for pension. 2)The court could not see nothing in the Crown Liability & Proceedings Act or any other statute to which we were referred, which would impose upon the appellant the reverse onus for which the Crown now contends. 3)The Court could not read into the legislation concepts that were both unexpressed and unreasonable."

The vessel was purchased in 1988 and used as a charter vessel in Maine and the Carribean. An assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. The respondent argued that the province can only impose direct taxation within the Province and that temporary presence is not sufficient to raise an assessment under s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without costs. 1)There must be some legislative jurisdiction in the air space above it so that the pivotal question is whether the entry into the province of the aircraft and parts in the course of the operations of the airlines previously described constitutes 'bringing' or'sending' them into province or'receiving delivery' of them there. While would not, in the absence of detailed examination, wish to categorize the Act as being solely intended to impose retail tax payable by the ultimate consumer of the goods, there can be no doubt, as mentioned before, that this is its predominant purpose. The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon, 1943 CanLII 372 (UK JCPC), [1943] D.L.R. (4th) 218 the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether the Act applied to the vessel. 2)The Act applies to the aircraft, parts, equipment and rotary spares (hereafter compendiously referred to as 'aircraft and parts') when used in Canada under a customs permit. No customs or excise tax was paid. 3)The provision applies only to aircraft operations and to sales by the airlines of alcoholic beverages which are served to passengers on such flights after the aircraft is airborne and has achieved cruising speed. 4)Whether the Nova Scotia Tax Review Board erred in law by holding there was not sufficient presence of the yacht 'Sarah Kate' in the Province of Nova Scotia for the application of s. 7(1)."""

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The respondent Board denied the applicant's claim for benefits for the death of her husband on the basis that the deceased had not been found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The applicant applied for judicial review by way of mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, certiorari or to quash the respondent Board's decision. HELD: The application was denied. 1)Section 30 does not bar the Board from making decisions based upon the circumstances of the death or injury. 2)Section 45 does not shield the Board’s decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide matter but the legislation did not “intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board.” 3)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard."

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.

The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.

The officer noted that the vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, it did not stray into the other lane of traffic. 3)The officer testified that the accused had only one beer that date and that when he stopped, he braked abruptly. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their relative reliability, it is not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","This was a child protection proceeding in respect of a child who was under the age of six when taken into care. There was a delay in the proceeding for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns were advanced and alleged that the original agency was planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling for the mother. The trial judge, based on the best interests of the child, extended the statutory deadline for the first disposition hearing and then conducted the trial which gave one of the dispositions authorized by Section 42 of the Act which disposition was to be reviewed within the statutory deadlines. Jurisdiction was lost. The court had not lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. It was only in the rarest of situations that the Court could have made an order after the trial wherein that best interest has been determined if that order would operate beyond any given statutory deadline."

A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","HELD: The court found that an in dock identification was not the most compelling of evidence. The evidence suggested that the accused was simply scared to make an identification and that the person who had been picked up by the police was the one who had committed the robbery. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference, in the absence of anything else, that Mr. Brooks was just wrong. It was reasonable to conclude that the people found in the car when it was stopped were the people who got in the vehicle when it left."

He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was quashed. The court found that the defendant had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. It also found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish their business goals. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement [IDSL); (ii) the Software Customization Agreement [ESMA] and (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (ESMA). These contracts each provided, among other things, that any disputes which could not be resolved by a binding arbitration panel would be settled by binding arbitration. HELD: The application was dismissed. The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators' decision, and the application must be dismissed. 1) The language of the agreements, in particular, is so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and the finality of the arbitrator's decision, that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clause of the Agreement is clear, and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. 2) The agreements in place by HAL and SURTek do not provide for a right to appeal on a question of law. The agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. It does not permit the application of a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators’ decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. The scope of appeals permitted by arbitration legislation is narrow, because arbitration is intended to be a complete alternate dispute resolution mechanism, rather than simply an extra layer of litigation. 3) There are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. The question is whether s45(2)(a) permits the application, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements. HAL takes the position that this section provides the ability to obtain leave for cause. The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that 'go without saying' and are necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction. 4) There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of the meaning of the word 'final"

She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when she was hit by a tractor-trailer. She alleged that when the defendant passed her vehicle, a piece of metal came off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her car, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is now well established law that the applicant for summary judgment must meet a threshold test and establish that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to the facts. Once the applicant has succeeded in meeting this test the respondent must then establish that his or her claim is one with real chance of success. 2)The claim in the tort of negligence can only succeed if the plaintiff can show that the defendant owed her duty of care, that he should have observed a standard of care in meeting his duty, and that his breach of duty caused the damage or injury to the plaintiff. 3)There must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a determination of credibility.  4)The plaintiff failed to show that this claim had a genuine chance to succeed."

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her numerous times on her vagina and breasts. In all cases the touching was over top of her clothing.

She was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in the acts described in the allegations. 2)There was no evidence to support expert testimony. The complainant was convinced the accused was guilty of all of the offences. 3)The evidence of expert testimony was not supported by the evidence.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement. The father was the primary caretaker and the mother the primary caregiver. The mother sought joint custody and primary care with the father. The parties had lived together for a very short period of time and there had been significant changes in the children's lives. The Father was to pay child support of $502 per month. The Mother was to seek a reduction in the father's pension benefits. HELD: The court found that the information provided by the mother and her witnesses was credible and that the father was prepared to acknowledge the mother's involvement in parenting. There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The court was not prepared to modify the child support amount where, considering the financial realities of the parents, it would lead to significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they moved from one household to the other."

He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The Crown opposed release on the grounds that the appellant was a flight risk. The appellant had no prior criminal record, substantial assets, favourable pre-sentence report and had been on bail for 16 months without incident. He proposed that he be released on an undertaking to appear. He alleged the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant's condominium and failed to grant remedy as result. He also argued that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He argued that the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. He contended that his release was necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate. The court ordered the appellant released on a recognizance in the amount of $25,000 with the following conditions: 1) that he surrender his passport. 2) He surrender into custody in accordance with the terms of his release. 3) The Crown did not allege that the grounds of appeal were frivolous. The appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous. It is preferable that no more be said concerning the merits of the appeal."

The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was granted.  1)It was obvious that the accused was not entitled to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make. It may be that fairness requires the accused be given some latitude at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial. Otherwise, the Crown and the court are entitled to proceed on the basis that no Charter issue is involved in the case.  2)The court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. The court found that in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. This is different for trial court which hears cases that have been through preliminary inquiry and detailed pretrial, and that regularly assigns trial judges to cases well before the date of trial. 3)In Provincial Court, it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclude is made. This common sense proposition is equally applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence. In a situation where an accused is trying to establish that a constitutionally protected right has been breached, the court ought to give counsel more leeway in cross-examination of the defence's own witness than is ordinarily done."

HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.

His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright.

Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.

e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count. The learned judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the central Crown witness as this witness provided exculpatory evidence. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not adduced as evidence of impairment unless an accused has been informed of his right to counsel, the learned judge based his decision upon the evidence that the accused had bloodshot red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. 3)The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility by being able to observe the witness at the time of testimony and compare their observations to the testimony of other witnesses. 4)The appellant was acquitted of a second charge of operating a motor Vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to the Criminal code.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment.

In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed without cause. The employer argued that the contract was for an indefinite term or for a fixed contractual period. The plaintiff sued the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. Certificates were not provided to the plaintiff. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for just cause.  1) Summary dismissal is warranted for serious misconduct or breaches of fundamental nature that contravene clear and unequivocal policies, procedures or instructions well known to the employee. Where dismissal is for repeated instances of incompetence or unsatisfactory job performance the employers must show that the employer has established reasonable objective standards of performance; the employee has failed to meet those standards; the employer must establish that the employee failed to mitigate her loss. 2) In this case, the plaintiff made a reasonable effort to maintain employment and was dismissed summarily without notice."
5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an “oppression remedy” to the counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The judge granted leave to the appellants to commence derivative action against the defendants for alleged breaches of their fiduciary rights. The appellants applied for leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order in allowing the appellant to amend his defence to withdraw his admissions. There was no temporal connection between the appellant's shareholding and the impugned acts of oppression and the appellant could not be represented by the counsel of their choice."

The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code, Justice Cromwell issued a written decision granting the release with conditions pending the appellant's appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000.

The court of appeal ordered that the matter be heard by a panel of judges. It was not ordered to hear the application for judicial interim release under s679 but rather that the chambers judge erred in law in ruling the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of care and custody with no provision for access with respect to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father was residing with the mother and providing care at the time the child was apprehended. He was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of the Child Protection Act and was considered a party to the proceeding. HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody subject to the terms and conditions of the protection finding. She was to have unscheduled access to the agency and the agency with a list of babysitters, all pets be removed from the residence, restrictions on who could reside in the home with the child, instruction from family support worker on child care safety issues and couple counselling if the child were to develop a relationship with the biological father.

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to sections 253(b), 253(a) and s. 253(p). He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant waived part of it such that the remainder was not unreasonable. 3)The court was asked to infer prejudice on the basis that the length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the legislation was enacted.  4)There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as result of unreasonable delays in their trial."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting a summary judgment on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge committed no error in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries to the defendant. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, s. 62(1) and s. 2(ak). The plaintiff argued that the lease agreement fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner' and that the insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal. The appellants argued that s.62 can be applied so as to impose liability in circumstances such as the one described in Gordon Capital where the plaintiff's claim for vicarious liability against the insurer had a different result. The issue before the Chambers judge was whether the chambers judge correctly cited the test and whether he erred in his application. The court concluded that the issue of whether liability should lie against the employer, rather than obscuring the decision beneath semantic discussions of'scope of employment' and'mode of conduct', was one of the issues to be addressed."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. The trial judge awarded the mother custody of the parties' son to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the regular school year and for one half of major school breaks, with each party to share and assist in the transportation of their son for the purposes of access. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. HELD: The application was granted. 1)It is not possible to conclude that the child can be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time that Mackenzie was essentially abandoned by both parents until he was 10 or 11 years old, both of his grandparents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia. The person who is convinced that Clifton will accommodate Danita's access in the future should he be granted custody, irrespective of his financial situation, is the parent who is better able to understand and facilitate this need in the best interests of the child. 2)Given the facts of this matter, I can foresee no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay is lifted. Given the unfortunate circumstances of Mackenzie to this point, it is imperative that the boy be provided the opportunity to have regular and consistent contact with both his parents. The incentive on the father to perfect his appeal should he still wish to do so is the incentive on him to improve his appeal."

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application by a mother for variation of the judgment in which the father gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born in 1990 and 1986.

The mother applied to vary the judgment by granting mother sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with the father.

The alternative being requested is to move to a completely new community away from extended family and friends. 2)The father's move was not in the best interests of the children since there was no dispute about this since 1990 and indeed friends and neighbours from Melfort filed affidavits stating how much they enjoyed their visits with their mother and how they fitted in with the people of that town and environs, and he has, in addition offeredgenerous access."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They also opposed the certification on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The representative plaintiff applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, s. 491 and Rule 49 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173C application. They raised the following grounds: 4(a) the chambers judge erred in law in failing to find that the full extent of the conversations between the plaintiff and the class members (collectively the 'Respondent') and McMillan did not fall within a category within which existing precedent recognizes a duty to a lawyer to a client; and 5(b) there was no conflict between the affidavits of the Respondent and the respondents and no reason to entertain the supposition that the evidence at trial would be different; and 6(d) the test of policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty on them were essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim.

The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. 2)The police must have one of the purposes for a valid search incident to arrest in mind when the search is conducted. Further, the officer's belief that this purpose will be served by the search must be reasonable one. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, it was of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a firearm contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with intent to sell. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. The evidence led by the Crown established that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms and ammunition. The intercepts were also of crucial importance to the firearms trafficking charges. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the interest resided. 2)There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. Reasonable doubt was based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof."
6_2014skqb59.txt,"Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010. She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: The petitioner commenced this family law proceeding by issuing a petition in which she sought divorce and equal division of the family property estate. The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.). Specifically, she did not claim for spousal support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The court found ample authority for the proposition that retroactive support should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application.  2)The respondent was 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The respondent argues that he cannot keep up the pace of working overtime hours as he did in previous years. In assessing support, whether child support or spousa support, the court does not compel a payor to work overtime. The evidence establishes that the respondent's gross income in the year 2013, to his pay period ending December 14, 2013, was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income. [3] The respondent is 61 year old. He earns rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income, after payment of property taxes, yields $8,000 to the respondent. Given his age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. An application to amend the petition, amongst other relief sought, was consented to by the parties on October 17, 2013 and granted October 22, 2013. [4]The petitioner was awarded costs of $1,200.00 payable by the father.  5)The Court found that the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes was $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory support is appropriate.  6)The petitioner is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540 per annum."

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts donot have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the respondent.  1)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. 2)The court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to s.15(1)(b). The court could not find jurisdiction under the Divorce Act as the child was clearly resident in Saskatchewan for the purposes of The Children's Law Act. 3)The Court had jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction under ss.15 and 1. The court was directed to set an early pre-trial conference date.
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The accused was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was also charged with impaired driving. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused's mental state during the time the police officer assumed some control over his situation, imposed upon him the obligations arising from s. 254(3) and (5)of the Code, and read him his s. 10 Charter rights. 2)The officer gave him an honest and reasonable understanding of facts sufficient to constitute proper grounds for a blood demand.  3)There was no evidence of lack of appreciation of the right to counsel. The officer's observations and contradictory evidence of other witnesses was not sufficient to determine whether the officer's belief was real and reasonable. 4)The court concluded that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of each of the following: the reason for the police's attendance at the hospital, (b) the demand, (c) the opportunity which was being given to him to consult with lawyer and (d) that what was being sought, the blood samples related to impaired driving and would put him in legal jeopardy. 5)The police officer's assessment of the accused's ability to comprehend and appreciate the rights of a person who is clearly and fully informed of their rights at the outset, and the standard caution given to detainees was as instructive and clear as possible."

The application is made pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990. HELD: Leave is given to the respondents to take further proceedings against the applicant. 1)The purpose of s. 53(1) of the Legal Profession act, 1990 is to provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with a decision of the Hearing Committee within 45 days so that disciplinary matters against its members may be dealt with in timely manner. The process must be completed without undue delay and thus protect the member's interest. 2)The applicant is a paid-up practising member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, the applicant was granted an inactive membership. He applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave was denied on May 22, 1997. The respondents conceded that no action was taken with respect to the sentencing of the applicant between August 9, 1995 and May 30, 1997 and that they were advised that it would be inappropriate for them to proceed in the face of a challenge to its jurisdiction. The applicant was convicted of one count of theft and two counts of fraud and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation to the victims of his crimes. The Hearing Committee did not have jurisdiction to proceed further against him."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 2)The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on a prosecution of April 8th events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on that date. If this were to be a trial by jury, severance on that basis would be appropriate because of the risk of propensity reasoning by the trier of fact. There is no such risk in having all the counts tried together and further delay would thereby be avoided while he is in custody. 3)Sellance is required in the interest of justice, as per s. 591(3) of the Code. The interests encompass a multiplicity of offences having little legal or factual nexus. The issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and there is no common evidence. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. It is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8 and April 14th but not in respect of the April 15th events. The court may, where it is satisfied, order the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts. 4)While an accused's stated and objectively justifiable intention to testify on some but not all counts is not necessarily determinative of a severance application, it can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests require a joint trial"

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation in the form of damages from the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not, in my opinion, a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief.

The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and the child shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is that the child has a strong bond with both parents and Lesly's support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. Costs in the cause. 1) There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 2) Lesly had chosen to relocate to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly. She applied as primary parent. She was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing the child and shared other parenting duties. The issue of mobility was clearly unresolved. 3) The respondent was to pay to Lesly for each occasion that the mother travelled to Victoria. She had made choices which resulted in greater expense to insure that the kaira sees both parents. Accordingly, the cost of transporting the child to and from Victoria shall be borne primarily by Lesly and the petitioner. The petitioner was to provide telephone access to the child every second day at 7:00 p.m. Regina time during Lesly’s parenting time and 7:30 a.m Victoria time during her parenting time. 4) Costs to the cause were to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 1996 CanLII 191 (4th) 321, which are well known and which are germane to the case. 5) The status quo was the attachment the child had with the primary parents and that is Lesly but there was a compelling reason for the status quo to be maintained unless there were compelling reasons not to do so."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent while the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while LM. requested the continued intervention of the Agency. During summations, the Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child C.B., but sought the termination of its involvement with K.B. The Agency did not participate at the disposition review, although it had participated in previous hearings.

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and she assumed her position in 1999. She testified that she met the accused in the office of the Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court concluded that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. The Court found that the Court believed that allowing the Crown to use the statement to cross-examine the accused was tantamount to allowing the accused to enter the statement as evidence and, in that manner, to allow the Court to split its case."

The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.",HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered the trial to be held in Unified Family Court. The Court found that the information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when the information was given.

The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody.

If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The matter was before me in Chambers on July 20, 2007. On that date made a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues to be resolved were: 1) what, if any, retroactive support should be ordered in this matter? 2) what spousal support was payable by the father to the mother pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Divorce Act. In the matter before me, the father was unable to make a child support order because the mother did not file enough evidence regarding her circumstances. The father was ordered to pay costs in the amount of $400 forthwith. The mother's claim for the father's assistance is made pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175)."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class. It is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted on October 23, 2002, of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. He appealed the conviction. HELD: The appeal was set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; (i) believing in the existence of photographs enhanced the credibility of the complainant; (ii) the trial judge misapplied the test in determining credibility; and (iii) he failed to apply the appropriate test for a prima facie case of assault. 2)The court found that there were photographs to corroborate the complainant's testimony relating to her injuries. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone. 3)The appellant's testimony when he stated that he did not cause injuries in forcing the complainant to return to the truck did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. Where it varies from the evidence of the accused on these points, do accept the evidence in preference to his evidence. The appellant denied that injuries suffered by the complainant resulted from the manner in which he returned the vehicle. He explained how the complainant could have injured herself when attempting to kick him while they were both seated on the ground. The only evidence presented relating to the defence was that he used force only to protect the complainant from the natural hazards that existed in that location at night. There were no injuries."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant places in issue whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injury suffered by plaintiff. 2)The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. These findings leave only the third of the four ""Maxay"" principles to be addressed. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on her floor of the store. However, some of the injuries appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 4)The plaintiff did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where she fell although it does not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.",The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The essential facts were not in dispute. 2) The respondent was only looking after the child for a couple of hours as opposed to the respondent who was raising four children with developmental and health problems and severe problems of her own. The respondent refused to seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. She did not seek the support of her spouse but the fact that both parents were more concerned about their drug habits than they were about facing the challenges of looking after their children. 3) The sentence imposed was in the low end of the range because of the personal circumstances of the accused. The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offence. The trial judge failed to give adequate weight to both the seriousness and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to address s. 718.01 of the Code. 4) The court was satisfied the appeal should be allowed on the basis of this latter ground. 5) The sentences were tailored to suit the degree of moral fault of the offender.

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused and the surety. HELD: The application for forfeiture was dismissed. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.

The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,"This was an application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue is whether the Court has discretion to refuse having regard to the provisions of s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The youth court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him. The application is all that has been decided in this case. Nothing in this decision should be read as in any way denigrating or casting doubt on the proposition that young people in this province have the right to counsel. 2)There was no evidence that the young person was unable to obtain counsel through Legal Aid initially. It was clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. The young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge his counsel for whatever reason and repeatedly insist on the appointment of substitute counsel."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The appellant sought payment of $5,855 in full compensation for its interest in the expropriated land for widening the Bedford Highway. The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993 and the effective date was September 8, 1993. The solicitor-client account was taxed in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. The notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act and certificates of readiness were filed by counsel and the Board set the matter down for hearing on November 14, 1994. The appellant appealed the decision of the Taxing Master to reduce the solicitor's account from $20,000 to $10,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs confirmed. 1)The appellant was correct that the failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the appellant's offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 2)There was nothing in the decision to suggest that the taxing Master disallowed any services that were actually incurred. He simply concluded that the services, although actually incurred, were not reasonable in all the circumstances.  3)The taxing master was correct in stating that the initial offer made in an 'expropriation' was an initial offer and not necessarily or likely the final position of the appellant. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such interest and he was correct to put even greater weight upon the expert's report recommending an appropriate fee for the legal services."

The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","The appellant was charged with driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or drug and for refusing a Breathalyzer test. At trial the Provincial Court Judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the demand. That decision was not under appeal. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The findings of the learned trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the SL-2. There is, however, an exception to this rule in which the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict.

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues.","The defendants applied for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant in support of their application for carriage of the proceedings. HELD: The applications were dismissed. The court emphasized the importance of providing on certification motion a proper evidentiary record for resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions were whether the affidavits should be examined for cross-examination by third parties or examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross examination."

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.

The hearing officer declared that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and that the hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order of possession of the rental unit. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. Those circumstances do not exist here and conclude that the Hearing Officer did not err in law in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 2) There was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant was not at fault in this situation. He signed a lease in good faith and did not intend to act for his mother. He was acting for himself and asserting that he had that right. 3) The Hearing Officer erred by declaring that the landlord had not provided the tenant with a written agreement that substantially complies with the provisions of the tenancy agreement.  4) The tenant's obligation to pay rent is suspended if the landlord gives notice without the consent of all joint tenants. 5) The landlord may have remedies against the tenant for any damages he has suffered as a result of his dealings with the tenant. 6) The tenancy agreement is not invalid if the tenant fails to provide the information required of the landlord pursuant to s. 7(f)(i) or s. 8(f) of the Act. 7) It is just and equitable for an order to be made pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Code of Conduct. 8) In any situation where one person has so acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person to act on his or her behalf, and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person, it is in the public interest to hold a hearing.

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000.

The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clements was supported by probative evidence."

The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter. At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression. The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings on Robie Street. These one time family homes have been converted into apartment units. In response the respondent repainted the buildings in a haphazard and multi-coloured fashion. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s.24 of the Charter. If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary. 2)The trial judge made no error in law."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of sexual assault. He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended the evidence on this point by failing to give proper effect to it. The judge's reasons for rejecting the accused's testimony and finding that it did not raise reasonable doubt are based on misappreciation of the trial record. 2) There was no other way in which the appellant's evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The evidence bearing on the appellant’s credibility was highly material to that critical issue. 3) The trial judge failed to give a proper effect. The court was not persuaded that the evidence was substantial, material and essential to the conviction."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.

For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed for several years by a classification society with rules and regulations for number of functions including construction and design of vessels and offshore platforms. He was given two days written notice of termination without cause.

He alleged that the agreement did not purport to deal with the plaintiff's termination of employment.

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to child support, the agreement provided that spousals would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner sought to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The parties agreed that Melanie remained a child of the marriage and that an equitable sharing of economic consequences would be achieved. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed.

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered a guilty plea to one count of driving while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. The Court was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities the accused would not drink and drive again, her conduct over the last 18 months suggested that it was probable she would not. The court ordered the accused to continue attending AA two to three times weekly for the next year at a minimum. She was also ordered to continue contact with a professional addictions counsellor."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child together. The applicant claimed that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that following the settlement she felt the need to settle. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed, that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed and the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and there was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The additional income came from investment income and rental income that she received from a tenant who rents a basement apartment in her home as well as rent from boarder. The household expenses that the applicant claimed in relation to her rental income exceeded the actual rental income and there were no adverse tax consequences to receiving those monies. 2)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. 3)It was not necessary for the court to determine the agreement was unconscionable. The court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 4)The parties had signed an agreement in January 2003 that provided for an approximately equal division of matrimonial assets and debts. The assets received by the applicant exceeded in value the amount of her mortgage but that was offset by the respondent's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused was charged with 56 offences set out in eight Informations. Six of the Informations involve co-accused Osman Hassan Mohamed and/or Faysal Abdi Hassan. Most of the offences are alleged to have taken place in Regina, Saskatchewan on or about June and 7, 2012 and involve such charges as: conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime and possession of a counterfeit mark. HELD: The accused was dismissed from the application for a stay of proceedings. 1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time.  2)The Court dismissed the application to stay proceedings on the basis that the accused did not establish on a case-by-case basis that there was an actual breach of the right to a fair trial within reasonable time as guaranteed by s. 11(b).  3)The court found that the individual rights of the accused must be balanced by the interests of society in law enforcement. 4)The respondent had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of the respondent."

When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue is whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse'. This is what happened. The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence. He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment. On the return date the accused did not show up, so the present charge was laid. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse. 2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was eventually stayed by the Crown."

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the contract between the defendants and the City of Regina.

The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT.

The words'shortfalls' and 'deficiencies' do not add much more. It does not follow that because plaintiff is, upon discovery, given access to documents or information that will, of themselves, constitute admissible evidence.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT.

HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal-mart should be dismissed. The affidavits of the former vice-chairperson and his statement of claim have no value. The affidavit is not sworn and as such is not admissible to prove the accuracy or truth of what they contain. The transcript of the radio broadcast is attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests that he prepared the transcript. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript of that broadcast.  1) There is no necessity for their admission. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. The only documents which are properly before the court on a reasonable apprehension of bias against the applicant are the Leader Post article and an article from the Regina Leader-Post newspaper dated May 11, 2006. 2) The affidavit of Walter Matkowski with 39 exhibits is admissible by reason of s. The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S., c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the Legislative Assembly, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Queen's Printer shall be deemed to be authentic and make proof of their contents without other evidence; That provision enables the extracts to be filed to prove what was said, but not as proof that the remarks were true.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the respondent was not fit to stand trial. It held that the trial judge erred in applying the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence."

Defence now wants further disclosure of information for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an inquiry into the facts that relate to those important issues.

The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and using a weapon to wit a baseball bat. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence of two years is set aside, and a sentence of 2 years less a day imposed in its place. The probation and all other provisions of the sentence are set aside. The sentencing transcript shows that there was essentially consensus between the Crown and defence as to the sentence that should be imposed. The court reduced the appellant's sentence to one that would allow him to preserve his immigration appeal rights. The same response is appropriate in this case."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.

This offence occurred in a particular circumstances and there was no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor was there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. 2) The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record and he had not previously served time in jail. 3) The court found him to be in good standing with the community."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","The parties entered into a joint venture agreement whereby they sought to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of their Participating Interest at any time during the currency of the agreement, the other Parties hereto having a Participating interest in the Program Lands or Project Area affected (hereafter in this Section 14.01 called the 'Purchasers'). The appellant relied on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than any part of its Participatin Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The words in the parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase 'participating interest' in the program lands or project area did not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant. 2)The phrase 'the parties being absolutely prevented from selling or assigning, transfer or otherwise disposed of any other than all of its participating interest' was used to create a complete right of first refusal. The phrase 'ownership' was not used to refer to a broad definition of ownership, nor did it constitute a right of return."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The affidavit of Ms. Scott showed with precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be. The need for “showing” the amount is obvious; (iii) to require the plaintiff or his/her agent to not merely allege that indebtedness is owing but to formally attest to the existence of it and thereby warrant, not only that claim is genuine, but that it is not provisional or contingent; (iv) to identify some third party (garnishee) who is alleged to owe money to the defendant that can be attached and applied to the payment of indebtedness. 2)The plaintiff's claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to ss.3(1), and if it is for an unpaid judgment or alternatively, a claim for a debt or a demand and not an indebtedness that falls outside those limits. 3)There are four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act as outlined by Bayda in Conexus, supra.

5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent's medical condition and his use of marijuana were no risk to his children. The Court believed that concerns relating to the respondent’s medical condition could be managed if the children continued to have regular access with him. The respondent did not consider that his children expressed any concern about his medical condition, his marijuana use or his driving. As a result of the late filing of documentation and review of the allegations contained in that documentation, the respondent was not able to participate in the settlement conference."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.",The justice of the peace made an order granting Dolgopolfrom exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining him from having contact with his wife or daughter during the course of the appeal of the order.

At the time of its making there was no urgency necessitating any extraordinary action. The order will terminate forthwith.
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a subcontractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

5_2013skpc45.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at this business. The defendant continued to monitor those temperatures at the business even with the dispute. Even with this dispute, Gardon continues to monitor the temperature at the premises. That monitoring is done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. As no alarm notification had been received from the defendant, it is equally possible that the reason no alarm was received by the defendant was that none was generated at the company. HELD: The action was dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. 1) Based on the original contract between the parties (Exhibit P-1), and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the onus was on the defendant to prove on a reasonable basis that the breach of the contract was within their control. It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that resulted in no alarm being received by them on August 14, 2010 and no request for repair was ever received from this business after this incident; and the detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon, ensure that there is no breach of their contractual obligation. 2) The monitoring equipment was installed in the cooler and freezer of the business in January 2006 for the sum of $1,190.26 and was monitored by the plaintiff in the months leading up to that day. The plaintiff submits that there were two temperature probes in the walk-in cooler and the freezer that led to no alarm from the plaintiff on the dates in question and that no freezer alarm was actually received from them on that date. 3) The defendant says that the obvious cause of the fact that no alarm (which am satisfied belonged to and was the responsibility of the plaintiff) either failed perhaps from lack of proper maintenance or was adjusted improperly by someone other than an employee of the defendant. Given the exclusion clause in this contract which am satisfied is enforceable (see Fraser Jewelers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) (Ont. C.A.) the issue becomes whether there was cause beyond the defendant's control which resulted in a failure or a failure of monitoring equipment so it could be reported to"
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT. The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001 to expunge child support arrears that had accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support and that, in the absence of a special circumstance, arrear arreages should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay the child support payable in the amount of $9,000.  1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in basic child support, $249 per month in s. expenses and $2,589 in child support costs. 2) There was no undue hardship to the parties as the respondent was putting money away for his retirement. Almost every dollar that was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him was snatched away from him."
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University. He sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant objected to the Crown calling a witness as he raised issues regarding the wording of the charge set out in the indictment and how it is defined by law. The trial judge did not enter into a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence to give. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay?” HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the evidence was part of the “narrative”, giving context to such events as the appellant’s discussions with the professor prior to the email being sent and the fact that the email was written in such a way as to make it clear that the sender intended the message to be taken seriously in line with the authorities relied upon by the Crown."

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused is charged with break and enters of homes and is accused of committing them.

Defence counsel objected on this basis but he also argued that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. HELD: A stay of proceedings is out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence has been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of Whitecap.

The accused must not have intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the complainant and he must have used no more force than, in the circumstances, was necessary to protect himself. There was no evidence to support the proposition that without justification the accused provoked the assault upon himself."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the YCJA for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention on the basis of two days for each day spent in detention. The accused will be permanently disabled as a result of the assault. 1)The accused was cooperative with police and provided a statement. While in detention, he remained in detention while three reports were prepared and his family was fearful and will continue to suffer. 2)The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. He expressed remorse in light of comments made at a show cause hearing to the effect that he wished he would have killed the victim. The Crown disagrees but is not in a position to take issue with the accused's allegation. 3)A period of custody is necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court has little confidence that the young person would successfully comply with conditions, if probation alone were imposed, given his history of non-compliance."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal is from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal is allowed on the same basis in respect of the 1997 assessment of a shopping centre in Saskatoon called Market Mall. The issues raised by the appellant in this case respecting the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of Market Mall are exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment dealing with a similar assessment of Midtown Plaza. The same reasoning applies in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. As with all enclosed shopping centres, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for Market Mall as if it had been grouped with all other commercial buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City brought an application to review the assessment. The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, identifying that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brings this application to the City. By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week which has a public holiday. The provisions of the agreement are more favourable to the employee than the Act. HELD: The City's application is allowed and the certificate is amended to show that there are no wages due orowing to Albert Morgan. There will be no order as to costs. 1)Nothing in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act affects any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or custom insofar as it ensures to any employee more favourable conditions, more favourable hours of work or more favourable rate of wages than the hours of labour provided for by the Act or by any other Order or regulation. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue. No holiday means no issue. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (the ""agreement"") it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act pay. Thematerials satisfy the Court that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the City paid Morgan 87 hours of pay over the Act's requirements for hours worked in week containing a holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants were charged with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. The Crown brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant's residence which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine was granted and the evidence obtained at the preliminary inquiry relevant to this application was admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. This should not be considered a usurpation of the trial judge's function. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge."

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345.

They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. For the purposes of the application for admission of new evidence, this question does not matter because the amendments set out in the purported Bylaws 2.1993 do not relate to any issue in this matter.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs brought an action for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs had an investment account with the defendant and claimed that the defendant caused them to suffer losses on investments. The defendant counterclaimed that the delay was caused by the death of the plaintiff's solicitor and the difficulty in locating competent counsel to advance the claim after his death. The defendants counterclaimed damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and professional malpractice. HELD: The application to dismiss the action was dismissed. 1)The delay was not inordinate. It was not inexcusable. The delay was entirely due to the negligence of the defendant solicitor and he was blameless. 2)The defendant acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. 3)There was no evidence to support the claim that the plaintiff was personally to blame for the delay. There was no injustice in his bearing the consequences of his own fault. 4)The court found that given the chronology of events and actions by both sides, the delay is inordinate and it is not inordine. 5)The plaintiff was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it is likely to be seriously prejudiced."

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act directing that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loans. The Bankrupt filed a Consumer Proposal under the BIA. She successfully completed it on March 4, 2005 and received Certificate of Full Performance dated April 13, 2005. The proposal was administered by the Government of Nova Scotia through the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Debtor Assistance.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24-count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in a usable format. The motion has two separate components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, 'the usable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence have been provided. The issue that has arisen in other cases has been whether the method of disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it is provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of an accused to make an answer and a defence. This is a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. HELD: The disclosure provided is appropriate. It is appropriate to provide hard copies of all the police officers' notebooks dealing with their testimony, if printed, would also be provided to defence counsel in preparation for trial.  1) The nature of disclosure provided by police officers in their notebooks was appropriate. 2) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers’ notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. 3) It appears to me that that day will soon come when the ability to operate personal computers and retrieve data stored on computer disks and related media by means of software programs designed for general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving voluminous amounts of data. It appears that that will be a reasonable request."

Subsequent to the provisional order there was evidence that the applicant had received a promotion and may also have income as a musician. HELD: The confirmation hearing was adjourned and the matter was remitted back for further information. The court was not satisfied that it had accurate information as to the applicant's present income so as to warrant variation.,FIAT. On the confirmation hearing the Respondent testified that at the time judgment for divorce and corollary relief was granted the Applicant was receiving $880.00 per month in unemployment insurance.

The applicant had not paid any support since obtaining that order. HELD: The matter was adjourned for further information as to the applicant's income.
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had 67 prior convictions, four of them assaulting peace officers. He had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer when he was 16 years old. HELD: The accused was found guilty of a serious personal injury offence. The Court found that the accused exhibited indifference to his own safety and that, given the accused's past actions, it would appear that he did demonstrate such indifference."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. The police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The breathalyzer certificate was excluded. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent waived that right. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper, the evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. 2) An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee, who has previously asserted the right to counsel, indicates that he has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his rights to reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 3) The holding-off requirement flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded such a warning was required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst Lerat. That being so, the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s rights under the Charter. 4) The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed mind about seeking legal counsel. 5) The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean that the Crown has not been advised of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."
d_2011skpc108.txt,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was not guilty of the offence of common assault. The accused bears no onus whatsoever. The Crown must prove that the complainant did not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred, and the accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the co-buyer on the purchase agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11/2001 to November 14/2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The Credit Union claimed the claim of the respondent was enforceable. In the special circumstances the Court declined to order costs of either motion."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner sought continuation of the order and supervised daytime access. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The best interests of the child is not simply the right to be free of demonstrable harm. However, if the allegations are based on speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, then the court should reject them. Any other approach invites abuse. 2) The court was unable to conclude from the evidence that there was anything to be taken from this incident that demonstrates any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence before the court was that the respondent was significantly involved in his daughters’ lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments."

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that he would pay her $3,000 per month which included support for their son Michael as well as her. Since then the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,000. Since the petitioner reduced the support to 1,500, even those were irregular and not on time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $2,000 as noted above without at least consulting with the applicant. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received. 2)The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected each party would receive approximately $30,000 in early June when net proceeds were distributed. 3)There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There is the uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income. There was no evidence asto what she will require if she does go touniversity this fall. There are uncertainty as to what the two children are going to do about future education. 4)The applicant sought interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government which when the petitioner and applicant's current income is taken into account indicates that the respondent should pay the applicant around $ 2,400 per month. 5)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of the maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There were no unknown factors in either party's future economic situation. The respondent's future employment was uncertain. The applicant's income exceeded $80,000 annually but it must be noted that the status of his employment is that he is currently suspended with pay. What is going to happen to his employment situation is up in the air and this factor hangs over all of the issues yet to be settled in these proceedings including this application. Should his pay be suspended for a period of time or his job lost then both parties would be required to reassess their respective positions."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","The plaintiffs, who held $2.5 million in debentures issued by the Respondent, Medusa Medical Technologies Inc., commenced a separate action against the defendant, Boone and Bough, alleging breach of contract and resulting economic losses. The plaintiffs sought to convert the application into an action. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court found that the application was not appropriate for an allegation of 'oppression'. 2) It was not satisfied that the initial application of the plaintiffs should be converted to an action at this time. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the defendant's enforcement application. The defendant had failed to meet its burden of proving such a proposition on a balance of probabilities."

Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside as premature an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the Eastend Wolf Willow Heath Centre. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The Health Centre was correct to regard itself as successor employer to both of the institutions which served Eastend. This was undisputed. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the Board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in parallel areas for example, property law, begs the real question. The Board is within the purview of the Board to interpret s. 37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. In the circumstances the Board focused on facts they found to be significant. It does not, however, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. It cannot say that the lesser test set by it is not patently reasonable in context."
7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. HELD: The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. That would include not having either cross-examination of the plaintiffs' witness or to present its own case. The court found that the proper interpretation of s. 219(2)(a) of The Business Corporations Act is that the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The dissolved corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the claim. The plaintiff corporation requested that the affidavit of Marilee Fehr be considered by the Court on its behalf. Ms. Fehr was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than two months have now gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home.

The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants. 1) The property was not within her means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The plaintiff was not the only one experiencing problems with her home. The defendant's realtor also misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home and in answers that she gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale.

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The Crown appealed. It argued that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the warrant. The court found that the search warrant was quashed in error.

The defendant argued there was an 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries.

The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.",HELD: The Court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

This point was raised before the chambers judge in the Supreme Court and is referred to in his reasons. The amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. Any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor which may result if the amended ground is found to be without merit is not attributable to the fact that the ground is advanced by way of amendment as opposed to having been included in the original notice. There is no suggestion of any prejudice in that sense resulting from the amendment."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge and described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. A conditional sentence would not best deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child pornography. A sentence of 10 months imprisonment would be appropriate."

The court did not issue a summons as requested. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating.

He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.

HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

In the past he had been diagnosed as being of sound mind and able to manage his own affairs. In any event, in 1987 he qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provided his basic income of $580.00 a month. When you factor in the G.S.T. rebate his total monthly income is $630. At present he lives with a friend and buys the food for both of them. This cannot continue indefinitely. There is another source of revenue and that is the farm land which is rented out. He has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. On that amount, the respondent's total annual income would be $23,560. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate payment of $442.00. Any order as contemplated will not jeopardize the welfare of the children."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the petitioner was a person of sufficient interest and that access was not in the best interests of the petitioner. There was no presumption that access between the petitioner and her children was in her best interests.
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused are how his actions ought to be characterized. 1) The accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is legally irrelevant whose shanks caused which injuries. 2) The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding a principal to commit an offence; and 3) self-defence is not available to the accused. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. To “aid” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or help the actor. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour."
c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter. It is for this reason and as result of my observations of the accused while he was testifying that prefer the testimony of the officer over that of the police officer where there is discrepancy. 2)The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply a sample as directed by the officer. He gave his evidence in a forthright manner and accepted it without reservation.
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T. Equipment Ltd. applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant was a former 28 year employee of the Company. The Company was bound by the terms of collective bargaining agreement applicable to certain of its production employees including Mr. Tilk. Under the agreement the Company and employees agreed to fund a pension plan. At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. The January 13, 2003 Trustee application was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor who had been classified as a preferred creditor by virtue of s. 43(3) of the Pension Benefits Act. HELD: The applicant's proposal was accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 9.1 of the Proposal. 1) Taking into account the interests of the debtor (to give him an opportunity to meet with his creditors and to find a way of producing assets or revenue which will provide them with a dividend outside of bankruptcy), the general body of creditors (to protect creditors generally by insuring that what is put up by way of proposal is reasonable one), and (c) the public-at-large in maintaining the integrity of bankruptcy legislation (including considering whether or not the proposal complies with standards of commercial morality).  2) The proposed amended para was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and ss.50(13). The Trustee was in agreement with the second ground of the creditor's objection that the indemnification of past directors, present and past directors etc. proposed by the applicant was inappropriately wide. 3) The applicant refused to file proofs of claims.

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused.

c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company was involved in the manufacture of forest products for the log home industry. The process was not an insignificant process, nor was it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of the forest lands. HELD: The court found the defendant guilty of the following: 1) The definition of'manufacture' is extremely broad as it says'means any step taken'. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the defendant to fell, de-limb and deliver the logs to the yard. These steps may not be significant but the process is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The Crown's interpretation creates an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing licence for any processing facility that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. 2) The defendant did not have a Forest Products Management Act (FPMA) licence. The court concluded that the defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. The Court found that the defendants were guilty of violating the FMA. 3) The evidence was tendered by agreement. It was not the end of the matter. The evidence clearly established the defendant had taken steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in log home packages.

Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes.

He was also the respondent to the respondent's application for access to a third party's records.  3) In the event the province did not accept a claim method of review was established, the review process did not include an opportunity for persons against whom allegations had been made to respond. 4) In many respects as of December 1996, the ADR process may be considered anew."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff, the landlord, claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. The tenant denies responsibility, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500]. The tenant may set off this judgment against a base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease. 1) The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers from customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. Although the evidence shows that the restaurant was closed for several days even though daily overhead costs of $1,600 continued, no evidence was offered as to loss of profit or any other business losses. Nor has the tenant proved tortious inference by the landlord. 2) The evidence does show a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor."

Section 24 of the Act sets out the definition of professional misconduct and the conduct is defined in the Act as professional misconduct. The applicant was also charged with criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to him becoming a member.  3) The SAPLN takes the position that this Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy available. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined.  4) Harelkin v.

The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.

He failed to recognize stopped vehicles in the active construction zone and to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to safe stop before colliding with the rear of the Cobalt.

At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has been unable to enforce the writ due to the position taken by Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum. The process of the court has been thwarted. HELD: 1) The solicitor has no right to refuse production and delivery of documents on which he has lien. 2) There is nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the solicitor is not the owner of the shares in question. They are his and his alone. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. 3) Given the totality of what is before me, I do not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been made out.  4) The only claim against his shares within the company is the claim, as creditor. It is as creditor that the plaintiff instructed the sheriff, Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, to make seizure of his shares in Jen-Sim."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","HELD: The court granted leave to obtain the documents. The court found that in the circumstances the documents sought were not privileged because they were not made available to the public. It also found that there was no exceptional circumstance which would justify granting the necessary leave. The documents sought appeared to have at best tenuous relevance. They were found to be in the possession of Peter Muttart, Q.C. former solicitor to the defendants pertaining to or obtained in the course of his representation of Byung K. Lee, Canuck Development Services Limited, Bruce Christmas and Andrew Cooke in the planning of the construction and financing of the project.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","The chambers judge struck portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim striking.

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT The applicant, Landswest School Division, asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. HELD: The application is allowed. The court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The applicant has no right to subdivide save subject to the approval of the Planning and Development Act, the regulations and the Zoning bylaw. The respondent is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. Although the Court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect subdivision that is prohibited by the Act, it is not within the Court's power to order the respondent to apply for subdivision approval. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations. The application was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","HELD: All issues in this proceeding have been settled except to determine liability between Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company and the Facility Association for psychological injury suffered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not a person insured under the contract but was a cousin of the deceased. She commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It was admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the nervous shock from the Defendant. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident, the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was being defended by the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia.  1)The emotional harm suffered by plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The impossibility of contemplating the extent of the potential liability constitutes a valid reason for not distinguishing emotional damage resulting from such an accident to that of physical harm.  2)The plaintiff's Section Coverage did not extend to her claim."

The appellant and Gordon were equal shareholders in a company known as 'Gorbin'. It is alleged that the appellant placed a $75,000 second mortgage on a property owned by the company. The second mortgage was drawn on the Bank of Nova. In August 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent banks. The respondents applied to the Chambers judge under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25(a), to strike the statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or, alternatively, for an Order striking the statement as being barred by the Limitation of Actions Act.

It was recognized in Seacoast Towers, supra, that there may be exceptional cases where an agreed statement of fact is unnecessary, for example, where the facts underlying the resolution of the legal issue are matter of public record.

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent.

The criteria to determine whether or not taxation should be allowed after 30 days from the date the client received the bill is now, '... if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time allowing for the assessment of the legal bills by the registrar.'  1) The bill was rendered; that the client took exception to the bill; that client requested assessment, such request coming outside of the 30 day window provided in the Act; and that the respondent had determined that it was fair and appropriate to expand the time. 2) The evidence before the court was that the last bill rendered was rendered September 2006. There is nothing in the evidence which would indicate that the Back-Track September 2006 bill was intended to be an interim bill.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The trial judge held that the police entry and search of the respondent's home were justified. He did not discuss s. 24(2) of the Charter. The evidence heard on that Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. The court found that the respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that there were controlled substances or precursors at the residence and that the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded. The voir dire decision did not breach s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure.
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenant's request for an adjournment was properly served personally. The tenant took exception to being served with what she described as one business day's notice. Since she was not personally present at the hearing she could not even respond to such evidence or new allegations since she was completely unaware of them. The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of procedural fairness and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties.

To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.

Each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1)The applicant has a duty to defend. It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action.

It is not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa.
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner and her husband. HELD: The court did not want to specify a specific time period for the petitioner to move from the home. Counsel would assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period. It was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of Mike having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. No caselaw could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide: '15(1) unless otherwise ordered by the judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of a judgment or an order awarding a mandamus, an injunction, alimony, or maintenance for a spouse, child or dependant adult. Where judgment or order is stayed pending an appeal, all further proceedings in the action, other than the issue of the judgment and the taxation of costs under the judgment, are stayed, unless otherwise directed."

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it.

The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","HELD: The court found that the respondent was in contempt of court for failing to comply with the court order.

It was inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of his sole province to say, as the appellate court judge did, that Swan did not see any indicia of impairment. 3)Given these failures in analysis, it is not necessary for us to deal with an argument now presented by the Crown that the appellate judge erred with respect to the nature of the offence when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was 'care and control' (PTSD) when she made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge thereon."
c_1998canlii13623.txt,"FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992. The husband petitioned for divorce and corollary relief in 1992. The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","FIAT.

The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.

Both applications were successful and therefore the parties are self-represented. The court struck out the request that an injunction be issued ordering the trees be removed.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752.1 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment pursuant to S. 753.1. It also ordered that he be sentenced to a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offences followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. 1)The Court held that the first application to label someone dangerous offender was accomplished within the application of the criteria in the legislation to the offender's circumstances. The court determined that Parliament, through its amendment, determined that those offenders who fall within the criteria enumerated are, by definition, the worst of the worst and deserving of the dangerous offender designation. This issue is of particular significance to the accused because review of his big picture, including his family circumstances, his employment record, his conviction record and previous sentences, would not obviously label him as the worst kind of criminal society. 2)There was no evidence of violence or threats to others."

It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a Peace Officer. He claimed the assault took place while he was exercising some power or performing some duty imposed on him either by common law or statute.

The other officers eventually subdued the appellant who was then taken to the station and charged with the two offences for which the warrants were issued and an offence arising out of the disturbance on LaHave Street. The appellant raised a number of grounds, only one of which need dealt with. The trial judge failed to make the essential determination whether the officer had, in making the arrest, the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of Code. In the first place, the evidence did not support the conclusion that the accused was arresting the appellant for an assault on the complainant. The evidence was not made clear to the jury that they must make the necessary determination whether Constable MacKay had, as he did in the arrest of the appellant pursuant to Part XXVIII in relation thereto, is in the Execution of His Duty.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","HELD: The Court accepted the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. It found that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The Court also accepted the respondent’s statement that he was not prepared to accept the $625,000 bid on the subject quarters. The court also held that the respondent was not responsible for verifying the bid or for ensuring the deal closed."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The accused appealed his sentence, arguing that his appeal was sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. 1)The accused would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody pending appeal because he will fall behind in schoolwork and be unable to complete his high school education in a timely fashion. 2)Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, I am not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. The appellant's release so soon after being sentenced, in order for him to attend school in a community, would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. 3)The Court will be informed and guided by the principles set out in s. 679 of the Code in determining whether the appellant should be released pending appeal."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.",HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of claim for section 7 expenses for the parties' older child. The court found that the respondent had not provided any other significant financial support to their son since April 2008 when his partner was prohibited by Court order from residing there and their son accepted sole responsibility for payment of the rent. The respondent had made no effort to inform the court how he was meeting his support obligations or inform the Court of his financial circumstances generally.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.",FIAT. An application under s. 2 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act requires consideration of the following points in relation to the provisions of the Act; 1) The purpose of the Saskatchewan Farm security Act as set out in Section 2. 2) The motion materials filed by the applicant are deficient and ought to include a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service. b) a certified copy of title to the land in question to establish that the 'equitable mortgage' is registered and that the proper parties are before this court. The apparent refusal by the respondent to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review as information is available from other sources to deal with the matters in Section 12 (12(a) and (b). The review if necessary could express the limitations evident from any refusal by any refusal. The Board may apply incentives to the applicant to participate by following the procedures in Sections 12(5) and(7) of the act. 3) The deficiency in the applicant's motion might ordinarily merit a simple dismissal of the application but Section 20 of The Act would give the respondent a grace period of 1 year. This result would be unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtors and creditors and the only material before me indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues.
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the parties had entered into an agreement in which the respondent was to continue to pay spousal and child support and the father was to take responsibility for matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. There had been no variation of the order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment and Divorce Judgment.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program.

He was suspended in March 2000. Since then, there have been a number of legal proceedings between the College of Medicine and the University, both internally and externally. In September 2004, an appeal committee of the University recommended that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency program on probationary terms. This decision was not yet implemented. In May 2005, the College requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: The College's secondary concerns for not considering an exception to the policy on the facts in this case are identified as concerns for possible breaches of provincial labour standard laws, or Immigration Canada requirements. The applicant should not have accepted the continuation of his salary during the period of his suspension. Raising these issues as an impediment to the implementation of the appeal committee decision reflects an extreme level of self-interest on the part of the College, without any recognition for the interests of the applicant who had no control over the College's decision, which was agreed to by the College and PAIRS, and breaching provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The College considers this condition necessary to maintain the integrity of its supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies and potential financial implications for itself if it should make an exception."

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed the damages at $25,000. The parties to the grievance argued that the trial judge erred by failing to find that the publications were protected by absolute privilege. The court found that the words were capable of bearing defamatory meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted were more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation."

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the accused was of the view that he was not fit to stand trial within the meaning of the Criminal Code and that his ability to communicate with counsel was sufficient to meet the fitness test. The Court found that, whatever the details, the accused's mental capacity was not limited to an inquiry into whether an accused can recount the necessary facts relating to the offence in such a meaningful way or assist his counsel during the course of trial. It concluded that his answers were not duplicitous or knowingly false."

The chambers judge relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra. The Chambers judge failed to provide any Canadian and English authority in which a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounced a right to inherit under each other's wills. Even if the former spouse were so bound, it does not appear that there is any privity of contract which would allow the appellant here, who was not party to the separation agreement, to enforce the agreement.

The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes.

e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact the City Assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the interest in a shopping mall as required by the Assessment Manual. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property and did not include any non-realty items. The assessment was made on the basis of the sale of three shopping malls, one located in the City of Regina and one in the Town of Normanview Mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. The appellant company appealed its 2003 assessment under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89 c.C.11. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The assessment of the Normanview mall was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. It was not open to either the Board of Revision or the Committee to have regard for the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information. 2)The sale of the mall did not require adjustment pursuant to s.173(5) of The Cities Act. 3)While the Committee sought and obtained information from the parties to the transaction for the three-fold purpose of putting him in position to determine the value of the property, the Committee did not reach the conclusion on the sales of the three malls. Rather, it reached the conclusion that the sale, contrary to what the Committee made of it, did not amount to an arm's length sale because Ontrea was not a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated, and knowledgeable' buyer. 4)The Committee did err in upholding the Committee's conclusions to the effect (a) it relied excessively on sale verification and the information it yielded, ascribing more importance to this information than is warranted by the assessment manual or (c) the Assessment Appeals Committee. It did not find any material error on the part of the Committee regarding the sale. 5)The committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of s.171 and (2) of the Cities Act and its information contained. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties. As for the sales pertaining to the Southland and Victoria Square Malls, the committee was not convinced the Committee had erred. 6)It was in reliance on the provisions in s.172(1)(c) and (d)"
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","HELD: The application was granted. The terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the parties. The respondent was content to receive assets mainly in the value of her car, leaving the remaining 87% of the net value of the family property to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment provided that only the 15 year old qualifies as a child within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, c.f6.2. Based upon the Federal Child Support Guidelines, the child will be 18 years old in approximately 18 months time. The economic value of releasing the respondent from her obligation to pay child support may amount to less than $1,600 in all. The court must not have been seen to legitimatize, condone acquiesce, acquiesce and acquiesce in acquiescing to the parties' wishes as to their choice of residence and the time that they might wish to spend with each parent. The parties do not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. There has not been equality in bargaining positions."

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. On the first ground, which is a factual one, the test is whether the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter]. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that the appellant had, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. While the appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision, it must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of a trial judge, especially in matters involving findings of credibility. The extent to which an appeal court may assess or review the findings of a fact by the judge has been well defined in number of decisions, including R. v. Shepherd, [2009] S.C.R. 353, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII) at para. 20; R. vs. Biniaris, [2000] SCC 15 (3d) 571 [Luong] and [2010] Sask. R.I.P. (4 and half years of experience at the time of the offence] were sufficient to justify the decision to stop the appellant's vehicle for a breath sample. 2) There was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that she was impaired by alcohol. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is correctness. 3) On the factual and legal grounds, the standard of review is based on a factual and/or evidentiary foundation which forms the basis for the judge's decision to determine whether there was a s. 10(b) Charter breach. 4) The appellant's subjective belief that she had personally and honestly formed the opinion that she could walk and enter a vehicle to determine if the driver was affected by alcohol was not the only basis upon which the judge formed his decision that the accused was impaired."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant sought a Voices of the Children report in the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order. HELD: A formal judgment was issued and a Voice of the Child report was to be prepared. The application was to have a formal judgment issued and to vary that decision in favour of her having primary residence. The respondent's affidavit was conflicting in nature and it was appropriate to ascertain whether the appropriate order at this time is the commissioning of the Voice of Child report. The variation is dependent on the report.  1) The parents are both significantly strapped financially and as such decline to make an order allocating the costs of the report to them. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents. 2) The respondent opposes the securing of a voice of the child report as it is a conflicting assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there resumption of shared parenting arrangement. The best interests of the children are still paramount and the wishes of V. are not independently determinative. The applicant's views will be assessed for the appropriate weight to accord them given V's maturity, experience and age. It will be one piece of evidence that will assist the court in determining what custody and parenting arrangement is in V's best interests."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from a convenience store clerk when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron contrary to s. 344 of the Code. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions set out in the probation order. The Crown now seeks leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. HELD: Leave to appeal permitted, the appeal allowed, the sentence set aside and in its place the respondent is sentenced to 2.5 years in an institution totalling 3 years. A probation order was imposed. 1)The respondent had a grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. This was not the work of a sophisticated professional criminal. He informed the trial judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem. 2)A suspended sentence, properly administered, was rigorous. The sentence was not fit. 3)The trial judge recognized that her disposition was despite what happened that night and despite what the Court of Appeal has said. Her disposition was still strong despite what had happened that evening and despite the Crown's recommendation of two to three years incarceration. 4)Sentencing must reflect the individual nature of the offence and the offender."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' and that the manner of the Crown's proceeding was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Crown appealed. 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction under s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code as the record is clear that Justice had issued a summons within three months of the loss of jurisdiction, so that jurisdiction over the accused had been maintained; 2)The special plea was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta. The special plea by the respondent was not available in Alberta and the matter was adjourned for hearing.  3)The province of Alberta did not withdraw or abandon its charges. The Crown could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s485.1 of the Code."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) of the Business Corporations Act. The Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch opposed approval of the plan on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights on dissolution and s. 220 directs that property distributable to creditor or shareholder who cannot be found shall be converted to money and paid to the Minister of Finance. HELD: The court found no conflict between the power of the court to approve a proposed distribution and the powers given the court under s. 210(l) to permit the Court to override the mandatory directions contained in ss. 220 and 221. The court could exercise its power under the s.210(l)(i) while comply with the mandatory direction in s.220. The purpose of the arrangement was to assist in relieving shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide them with an opportunity to identify themselves and to obtain return of their respective original investments in the Company."

A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track), filed in these proceedings as Exhibit P-1, supports the Plaintiff's belief that damage which occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by a run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. Photographs, as well as the evidence given by the town employee and the professional agrologist who prepared the report, all support the onus on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim is dismissed on a balance of probabilities. The onus is not on the Defendant to prove his claim on a 'balance of probabilities' and this involves proving that Mr. Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, I find he has not done so."
c_1995canlii5774.txt,"The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","The parties were unable to resolve three issues. The date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: 1)The respondent's obligation should end on November 30, 1995 and the net proceeds dividedequally.  2)The wife's obligation was to return all payments made since April 1, 1994 to the respondent. He was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to s. 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 3)The court found the property to be $49,000.00 on the date the action was commenced. Therefore, $38,600.00 was the value to be divided."

The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs. The Provincial Court Judge reserved his decision and then found him guilty. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice held that the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge's reasons did not offend the various criteria enunciated in the cases submitted by the appellant. The only fact which could possibly be in issue was the actual knowledge of the appellant that consuming liquor in combination with the sedative Librex could possibly have an unexpected impact, an impact which, according to the evidence the Defence produced, was unknown to his own doctor except on speculative basis. Given the brevity of the reasons, they could not be sure that he had properly considered all relevant matters.

c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me is whether it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred between the dates of October 1986 and 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. The accused was born on October 22, 1968 so that he ceased to be a 'young person' within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act on the first date specified in the indictment. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that she could not remember her age or date of the offences. HELD: 1)The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction respecting offences committed by persons while under the age of 18 years. The case before me has not come to me by way of transfer from the Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding is pending in Youth Court respecting these same events. The Facts Neither the complainant nor the accused are particularly credible as witnesses, each having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each has spent considerable time in jail. 2)Although the complainant was more credible as a witness than the accused, she did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to do so. Nor did his testimony leave me with any reasonable doubt the accused forced sexual intercourse with the complainant in the fashion she described and that he touched her on her vagina on one or 2 subsequent occasions. There is however no convincing evidence before me that any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on or after October 1986, the date he became an adult. The determination of the specific dates of multiple sexual assaults of children over period of time is not usually of critical importance, but it is in this rather unique case. Under s.486(3) of the Criminal Code, Youth Court Judges have exclusive jurisdiction over offences committed while under 18 years of age. The Court of Queens Bench accordingly has jurisdiction only when such matter is transferred to it pursuant to s. of the Act. 3)The only issue before the court is whether the sexual assault alleged occurred on the date that the accused became an Adult. The only issue is whether there was sufficient evidence before the Court to establish that any such incidents occurred. 4)The Crown could not find any dates beyond October 1986 when the accused moved out of Saskatoon."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997.

No notice was given to any other media. 3)The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division affected by the weight restriction. 4)No other notice to the general public was given."

The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.",The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of a child who is alleged to be of unsound mind. HELD: The order was granted. 1)The Act does not authorize the person to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of a dependent adult or person under mental disability. 2)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act did not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest was involved. That becomes more evident (although not crystal clear) when s. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the public trustee toact as the personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult.

It was not said at any time by the plaintiff or the defendant that the sexual assault had occurred."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal by the appellant against a decision of The Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford dated October 24, 1995 wherein she convicted the appellant of an offence that was analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of s.8 of the Charter. In Dersh there were actions analogous to search and seizures. The trial judge did not err when she found the appellant's rights under s.7 were not violated."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for their interests. The Ministry determined to pursue a permanent order on April 8, 2014. The best interests of these children compel such an order being made. The court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of his tenure. HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting this application and undertook to render decision on this issue at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court does accept that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial. 2) The issue in this case is not identification but the actus reus of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such a case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. 3) Logistical problems may be compounded by the lapse of time, surprise and the collateral issue rule. 4) The practical realities of the trial process reinforce the prejudice inherent in the poisonous nature of the propensity evidence itself."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:(a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or(b) that it be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. Here, some time would be expended in determining what undertakings could be responded to and what should be resisted. This delay tips the balance towards the defendant. The role of counsel in causing the delay [12] As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. In addition, this is not a matter that is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence."

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay.

The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992.

He was stubborn. He earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002 and did not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason. 3) Based on the evidence filed by the applicant, it appears that he did have the ability to pay the ordered child support in some of the years since the order was granted. However, he appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. 4) Given the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding maintenance payments."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called his son-in-law as a witness. The accused testified on his own behalf that he was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats when the alleged victim, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Hinz, his son, Cory Brown, his daughter, Richard Schmitt, and rink official, Mark Anderson as witnesses. HELD: The accused was convicted. 1)The evidence was at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendants. 2)The deminimus test of causation did not violate Section of the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice or of being too vague. 3)The Court of Appeal expressly stated that Nurse was incorrectly decided and the courts in Saskatchewan prefer the approach of the B.C. Appeal in R.v. Brooks where the court held the elements of assault causing harm consist of: (1) the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim; (2) that such force resulted in bodily harm; (3) the assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily damage."

A Queen's Bench Chambers Judge dismissed the application. This decision was appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's determination.,"The appeal, insofar as it is based on s. 180(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act may or may not apply to the judgment held by the appellants, we wish to make it clear that we have made no finding in that respect, since that question was not before us."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to this hearing. The Provincial Court judge ruled in favour of the Crown and held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. HELD: The Court found that the usual rule of evidence in criminal trials does not apply. The Court held that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did the defence seek to cross-examine them."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to the complainant. He appealed both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge clearly had discretion pursuant to Corbett to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. 2)The evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath was not raised in this case. Nor did the trial judge himself place any weight on the questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused. The issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or the complainant who was the driver of the truck at the time of the accident. 3)The appellant raised a number of valid objections on the veracity of the witnesses. 4)The defence argued that the appellant's cross-examination was improper and that his admission was more prejudicial than probative. 5)The Court was not satisfied the appellant had any effect on the trial."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The defendant was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. He gave more than adequate reasons for questioning the foundation the assessments were based upon. This finding, combined with his review of all of the evidence, was more than sufficient to support his conclusion that there was no'reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community' through the imposition of a long-term sentence as contemplated by s. 753.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code.  2)The judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' opinions."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Court of Appeal for a rehearing on an expedited basis. At no time did the appellant quantify the division of property he is looking for, let alone express the view that he is seeking an equal division of all matrimonial assets, or specifically half of the home equity. The facts and history of the case were obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The child support order of the Provincial Court was registered in 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983, S.S. 1983, c.R-4.1. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing child support to the respondent of $300 per month. Arrears had accumulated and he sought to expunge them. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's line 150 income did not reflect his ability to pay. In the absence of something further I am not prepared to impute income. The petitioner, having been found to have an income of $26,900.00, shall pay the respondent $5,100 per month as ongoing support. The rental income is said to be $6,300 per year. HELD: 1) The respondent was cognizant of the fact the petitioner’s farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 2) The petitioner was actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. He indicated that when the petitioner recently sought financing for the purchase of a half ton truck he indicated that he was able to average out his farm income in 2006. The three year average would be $21,834.00. 3) The court reviewed the farm income of the petitioner and found that he had been paying at a rate that is greater than his legal obligation. The arrears have accumulated and the respondent sought an order to rescind any of them. 4) Costs were divided. There was money sitting in Maintenance Enforcement Office as result of federal intercept."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called one witness who testified that the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate on this stretch of road. While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The only conclusion that the Court can draw is that this driving action was planned and deliberate. Therefore, the mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The Director takes the position that this Court is without jurisdiction to do what the applicant seeks and submits that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion. HELD: 1) The applicant does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) The principles and rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not be applied to situations where judgment of this Court was obtained as a result of the failure of an employer who has missed the 21 day limitation imposed by s. 62(1) of the Act. 3) There is no evidence before the Court that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that an individual who does not object to a director's wage assessment within 21 days can never set aside the resulting registration of judgment regardless of the reason. 4) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. 5 Accordingly am left with no discretion other than to dismiss the appeal which has been brought to this Court outside of the mandatory time limitation."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross-appeal dismissed. The court found that the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code were invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate the plaintiff’s pattern of practice. The principles of the Protocol were not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. The Protocol was designed to facilitate the payment of physician services through the use of AU codes. The evidence at trial indicated that physicians had the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health care plan, billing patients directly or submitting accounts directly for payment. However, the fact he was not paid does not mean the AU coding caused that result. By marking service “AU”, the Government was simply asking for more information. It was not denying payment."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 13.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there was a 'air of realty' to the plaintiff's argument that her injuries, tingling in her hands and arms as well as other injuries on the accident had resulted in her suffering injuries. HELD: The costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were ordered to be costs in the cause of the action.  1) It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. 2) Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were in the best interests of their four children and that it would be in their best interests to have them in the custody and primary care of their mother. The Court noted that the respondent's evidence and submissions should relate to what he considered to be in the children's best interests and what custodial arrangements would best suit their needs. The court found that there had been a permanent breakdown of the parties' marriage. There was no possibility of reconciliation. Divorce was issued.

e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The Act has since been significantly amended. This is a judicial proceeding where the legislation does not provide much by way of procedural requirements and the practice of counsel is to accommodate the deficiencies of the Act. The applicant protests that this is a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Commissioner or the Minister, and is not proper consideration on appeal. Section 19 deals with the right of appeal from the decision of Minister and the powers of the court on appeal are provided in 19(4); (4) The Minister and Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.

HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  2) The Court found that the accused’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired when there was an agreement between the province and federal government was not impaired. The Act simply states that the Crown is responsible for policing a municipality unless there is an agreement with the municipality. The Crown did not use words that implied derogation from the rights of an R.C.M.P. peace officer.  3) The police officer was found to be in the lawful execution of his duty and was within the jurisdiction of the city police.  4) The Crown was not able to argue that the officer was acting within his jurisdiction. The Court was of the view that there was no good public policy reason for the officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders, pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant in Turkey and the conclusion of this action. The defendants sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Application to amend the order granted; the defendants' application to add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the Statement of Claim granted. HELD: 1)There was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims.  2)Absent the expiry of a limitation period, the court may allow an amendment to the pleadings that asserts a new claim or adds or substitutes parties if the claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim. However, not every delay meets that mark. The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay, in the context of an application to terminate or modify the order.  3)In this case, the issue is whether the facts on which the Order was based have changed to the extent that the plaintiff no longer meets the third of the three conditions specified in s. 20(a). The legislature could not have made its intent more clear. Section 20 is not addressed solely to adding party, but substituting party and adding claim."

HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. This was the inevitable result of the trial judge's decision that the certificate of analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (the 'Charter'), the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) of The Charter, the admission of the certificate would bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: A new trial must therefore be held and ordered. 1)The appellant appealed the acquittal and the conviction set aside. 2)The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.

In both cases, the officers had proper grounds and the evidence was there for them. 4)The court found that the respondent was not required to wait 15 minutes on the grounds that he consumed alcohol in the previous 15 minutes. 5)The respondent's statement was not what he told to the officer.

d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to rule regarding three distinct categories of questions asked, but designated as undertakings. The first category is whether production by CN of document in respect of which it could have claimed litigation privilege waives any claim of privilege as regards background information to the document. HELD: The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning for discovery. The plaintiff argues that the approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. There is, in my opinion, no implied waiver of the litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of this sketch."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the respondent. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that confidential information was shared. The parties have not settled on the issues. HELD: 1) The applicant acknowledges that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer who took part in the collaborative law process to continue to represent the respondent as counsel as the issues between the parties had not been settled. 2) There is a dispute on the facts concerning what was discussed at the initial meeting of the parties with their lawyers. The additional evidence did not resolve the conflicts. The only way to resolve these conflicts would be by holding a viva voce hearing. It would be severely prejudiced if Nadine's lawyer, who had been retained as counsel in October 2003 when decided would be moving to Texas, were allowed to continue as her lawyer at trial. The spirit of confidentiality of a collaborative law meeting is broken if a lawyer that takes part in one can act at a trial. 3) There was no mention made in the minutes of discussion of or review of the two contracts. The evidence was not included in the contract. The court ordered the withdrawal of Sauer as counsel."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. HELD: 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. The statutory regime the Court must be sensitive to is the Trade Union Act. That legislation provides the Labour Relations Board with an exclusive domain on many matters dealing with industrial relations. 2) In this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to indemnity under the by-law. Rather, it is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of an indemnity by the Union by-laws. In that respect, the contest in this case is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. 3) In addition to clamorous debates at Union meetings and the three civil actions, there was a second front opened against the Union. The Union counterclaimed that the plaintiff was paying for the cost not only of the defence of the First Action but also the counterclaim contained in the Second Action. 4) The union counterclaim against the union was not supported by the evidence in the first action. 5) The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen’s Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. Exhausting internal remedies 6) The plaintiff is engaged in litigation respecting the union. The relationship between the union and its members is contractual and is governed by a written set of rules and regulations. The union maintains an unemployment board containing the names of out of work Union members, listing them in the order in which the Union is to dispatch them as jobs become available. 7) The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual in nature, and is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. 8) In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB.

Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","The accused was charged with murder in the first degree. He did not have the benefit of preliminary inquiry as result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him. There was no evidence before the court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. The accused brought this application for a stay of proceedings alleging that pre-trial publicity had prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity had not prejudiced the accused's right to a fair trial. It was also argued that the security measures presently in place and focussed on by the media have instilled in the general populous a climate of fear which makes the selection of a jury impossible. 2)The applicant had not established on a balance of probabilities that the circumstances of this case had been adversely affected. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the pre--trial media publicity, filled as it was with prejudicial and inflammatory information, had caused an apprehension of bias."
2_2007skqb444.txt,"The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code. HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of robbery with violence and assault with a weapon contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007. They were both 19 years of age and had spent 16 months on remand. HELD: The sentence was reduced to 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The victim surcharge was waived in respect of each of the accuseds in consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors. 1) The sentences were proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the violence committed against the victim. The 13 year old was conscripted to participate in this serious and violent crime. His previous record included two robbery convictions and one theft related offence. 2) The Crown and counsel for the accused had made a joint submission for a sentence of 2 years, 2 years and 1/2 years, respectively. 3) The court found that the sentences were appropriate in the lower range of the offences as they were both in custody for 10 months at the time of the appeal. 4) Sentencing guidelines were used to determine the appropriate sentence for each accused. 5) The sentencing guidelines were based on s. 718.1, s. 109 of the Code. It is in the best interests of society and the administration of justice to have sentences tailored to each offence."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff, who was the tenant and resided in the apartment building with her two young children and occasionally with her partner at the time of the fire, escaped the fire by jumping from the top floor of a three-storey apartment building owned by the defendant. The defendant was subject to statutory obligations. The plaintiff's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The fire alarm system was not functioning at the defendant's premises. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old. The smoke alarm system could also be operated manually at the plaintiff's residence. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was awarded damages for injuries suffered as a result of the defendant’s negligence. 2)The defendant was liable for the plaintiffs’ injuries where they may very well be due to factors unconnected to the defendant and not the fault of anyone. 3)Liability and damages were at issue in this case.  4)The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between landlord and tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendant owed a duty of caring to the plaintiffs to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. In the circumstances, the defendants’ negligence caused the plaintiffs damages."

He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications.

He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: 1) After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, I have reluctantly concluded that an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.  2) While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose conditional orders of discharge in this situation due to his low income.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.",The accused was charged with four counts of impaired driving. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in when she read the breathalyzer demand and that she was not feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station. The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and 9 Charter Rights of her. It should be excluded under s24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. There was no expert evidence called by either side. The certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breath test demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable.

The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused.

HELD: The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts filed as Exhibit P-1 and the production of five other exhibits. The Crown closed the case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. On all of the evidence, the defendant was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The defendant was found not guilty of the offence but was convicted of possession of a weapon and ammunition contrary to s. 76(1)(a) of the Act and s. 74(b) of s. 77(c) for the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, searchlight shall not be used for that purpose. The evidence was that he had dropped his son and nephew off in the forest and was driving slowly on roads that were in prime hunting area. All of these factors point heavily in the direction of hunting at night with the aid of searchlight. The point remains, however, that he would have the Court believe he was in vast tract of land in the dark, hoping to locate someone else who was there, hunting. As it was dark, the first thought that should have crossed his mind, if not that the task he was setting for himself was that of an injured individual in a large forest, certainly one would assume that the searching parties would have been yelling and making noise to attract the subject's attention."

Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to five counts contained in an indictment, now plead guilty to one count of break and enter.

The Crown has recommended a sentence of four years and six months in a federal institution. HELD: The court found that the appropriate sentence for the offence of being party to causing bodily harm was a period of six years incarceration.

7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while over.08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)The delay between the time the accused was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2). The accused had already got out of his vehicle before the officer approached and he therefore had less chance than normal to smell the accused's breath. 2)The accused had been detained for 17 minutes while the police waited for a roadside machine and he could not exit. 3)Because there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found within easy reach of the driver's seat, the police should have been prompted to make a demand. However, the officer chose to have the accused wait in the police vehicle because the search was being conducted at the side of the road. 4)There were circumstances in this case that should have prompted the officer to embark on an investigation of the accused’s possible impairment by alcohol. The delay in taking the test and in advising the accused of his rights to counsel violated the Charter and the evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded under s. 24(2)of the Charter. 5)The trial judge correctly ruled that the officer ought to have had a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. 6)On appeal, the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted the trial decision and therefore there was no unlawful detention of Shire and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was detained for a demand for roadside screening to the time that he was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both readings being 120 mgs."

Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claims $25,000 for damages for a house sale which failed to disclose a history of repeated flooding.

She did not warrant the condition of the property. 3)The court reviewed Sopinka and Lederman's views in their test The Law of Evidence in Canada (2d edn.) and concluded that the sufficiency of evidence was a question of law. 4)The Court was more comfortable with the law as outlined above."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The defendant had reorganized the dairy operation in 1987 under the company name of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene, Merle and Lorne owning M.S.D. Enterprises Limited. They each held a dairy operation with a total of 47,000 cows and a trailer park and a farm operation. The dairy operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, beef operation, trailer park, and a gravel pit operation. In the years since 1987 the evidence establishes that these two quotas separated in that it became possible to sell only MSQ. In fact, an exchange for the sale of MSQ was set up by the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission in November 1987 to do just that. The defendants sold the assets and the proceeds of the sale were divided in three ways. Gene Putnam testified that he was asked by his father to draft the agreements. He was not aware that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale and not all quota sold. He said he was not involved in any of the discussions with his uncles about the agreements covering the division of assets. HELD: The Court held that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of its milk quota prior to December 3lst, 2003, it would be obligated to divide the proceeds in the manner described in the agreement. The Court also held that there was no conflict of interest between the parties."

It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 235 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence was admitted as admissible under the principled approach. 1)The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2)The evidence was presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 3)The accused was only charged with second degree murder. The evidence could be used to show hostile behaviour by the accused which would lead to a motive to kill, or to show that the evidence of similar facts is tainted with collusion."

E.(Saskatchewan), 1992 CanLII 8071 (SK QB), 88 Sask. R. 262, or on the application of the evidence before him. The transcript of the proceeding before the trial judge confirmed that there was ample evidence of each child's need of protection as contemplated by s.11 of the Act and that the best interests of the children would be served by a permanent committal notwithstanding that none of them, based on the sparse evidence before the judge, was likely to be adopted. 2)The appeal court did not interfere with the findings of fact by the trial court unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable."

In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. In 1986, the appellant conducted an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with the view to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people. This resulted in the appellant obtaining a franchisee suitable to replace its Yarmouth agency. The trial judge held that the exclusionary clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of warranty. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The appellant had not established that the trial judge made some palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts. It was evident from the decision that the appellant had no intention of applying the provisions of the franchise agreement. With hindsight, it is obvious that the respondent's forecast was relieved because of the existence of a company that could not fit within the category of 'an existing jobber business' as intended in Ritchie's memo. 2)The respondent was aware that the franchise program was designed for the franchisee to assume full time responsibility at the franchise location. He knew that Murphy was engaged in other businesses and could not spend full time with the franchise. 3)It was important to note that Ritchie was the national sales manager specifically responsible for franchise program.

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. Since the issuance of an order directing the respondent father to pay child support in the amount of $454.00 per month, the parties have been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act."

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The Minister sought 13 Orders of Production for the respondent's complete medical records and files in the possession of her pediatrician, her family physician, the Early Intervention Clinic and her former counsellor. The respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with E.F. her former counselor with Capital Health Addiction Prevention and Treatment Services. The Minister was to prepare an independent parental capacity assessment with psychological component. HELD: The Minister's request was granted. 1)The court was not asked to balance right claimed by parent but was adjudicating claim put forward by the State. 2)The Minister had an obligation, because of the decision in D. P. v. Wagg (2004), to investigate any and all information regarding child protection concerns. This admission rendered further proof of the allegations irrelevant. No further evidence to prove the protection finding was required.  3)The Court was not satisfied that the production of all of the orders of production requested would save costs."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","The respondents (third parties at trial) acquired title to house property and caused to be affixed to the property firmly bolted by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for the use of their disabled foster child. A wheelchair lift ceased to operate. San Diego was told to get in touch with the Abilities Council the name of which was displayed on the wheelchair lift and did so. The Abilities Council wanted the lift back but San Diego negotiated a purchase price for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. The Jabours appealed the decision. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which in my view gives San Diego claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the Provincial Court Judge. The Workers' Council did not have an interest in the realty that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the trial judge."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, alleged that the defendant has wrongfully retained the sum of $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for breach of trust. The amount in the bank account was $25,000. The plaintiff's four daughters were entitled to the sum. The court held the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect instrument could be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust."

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Rentalsman's decision was patently unreasonable and unreasonable. He had reviewed the pictures filed by the landlord, repair bills filed by landlord, and statements of the house cleaners who indicated the hours worked and the hourly rate utilized.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","FIAT The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order.

This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) The fact that the father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as a part of his income. 3) With respect to the respondent father's 2008 income tax return, using the respondent's 1996 total income figure or his 1996 income figure, the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, the result of the appeal was announced from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. Although an action on a foreign contract debt is sustainable at common law, the Adjudicator determined Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. The Court found that the appellant had the option of proceeding to enforce the Alberta judgment under the common law and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act. As part of its defence, the appellant claimed the Alberta Court did not have jurisdiction. Documentation regarding the claim, defence and counter-claim were not available for review. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. 2) Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court Act."

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding.

HELD: The application to be joined by an intervenor is dismissed. 1) There are no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by non-party to be added to a proceeding as defendant, or as part of an interlocutory hearing pursuant to Rule 62.35. The Union does not have the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of these capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court. 2) The Union has filed two affidavits in support of its position on the present applications. 3) An appeal to the Court may only be filed by party to proceeding, or by intervener added pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules. 4) All of the issues set forth in the proposed notice of appeal are issues that can properly be addressed by a party for the purpose of launching an appeal, such authority arising from the provisions of the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the Court of Chancery in England. No other party was named as an 'Intended Defendant' (without more) in the original Ex-Parte Interim Application. No evidence was adduced that the Union was directly affected by this action. 5) In the absence of any other party who opposed the Union's application, the Union would not be able to make submissions to the court. 6) In order to continue the proceedings, the Court must first consider whether other submissions may advance the interests of LIUNA 1115, its members and members and may allow for additional grounds."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources sought orders pursuant to the Child and Family Services Act placing the children with the Department until age 18 and placing the grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The children had the same biological parents. The father was 13 years of age and the younger children were 13 years old. The mother was concerned about the hitting and the fighting between the father and the children and sought the return of the children to her care. HELD: The court found that the children were in need of protection and ordered that they remain in the care of the Minister until their 16th birthday. The court ordered that the father be placed in the custody of his grandmother until the age of 18. 1) The children did not attend the pre-trial or the trial.  2) The Court ordered the removal of the father from his current residence. He was served with the notice of the application and notice of trial. 3) An order placing the father until his 18th birthday did not constitute an order for custody. The Court found that it was appropriate to place the father with the Minister. 4) The Children were placed with their biological parents, [T.K.] and [E.K.' (who were both in Grade 8) and [J.S.] (who was in Grade 12). The father had been living with his mother for the past three years. He had been in foster care for three years and was living with the mother for three months. He did not participate in pre- and trial proceedings. 5) The father's position was to seek an order placing his children with his sister until age 16. The order was made to place him with his brother until his 16th Birthday. The parties were to meet monthly. 6) The court was to order the father to return to the mother until his 17th birthday on the condition that he remained in the home with the children. The Father was to arrange for the mother to have access to the children for a period of 3 months. 7) The mother's role in the children’s lives was to provide support and guidance to the father in the best interests of his children."

HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances.

The Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of this latest decision to make a continuation of custody application. HELD: The applicant was released pending a full hearing of the application.  1) The Court must necessarily look to these factors to determine whether there are compelling reasons to hold the young person pending a hearing. 2) Section 98(3)(b) provides for the decision to order a young person continue in custody until the expiry of the custodial portion of his sentence and must be considered when answering the question, 'Are there compelling reasons for keeping the youth in custody?'  3) Section 99(7) provides that at least days notice in writing to the youth and his/her parent is to contain advice regarding the right to counsel and is to be served personally or by confirmed delivery. There was no evidence in this regard.  4) The application was brought because the Court was not satisfied that the application had not been brought within reasonable time having regard to the circumstances and provided there were compelling reasons."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and refusing to reconsider the first two orders. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Matthews and Flinn, JJ.A., concurring. The court found that the Board was not bound by legislation to give reasons for its decisions and that in the absence of such a requirement reasons are not generally mandated."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the appellant was not a person in need as defined in any part of the legislative scheme and was not by reason of adverse conditions requiring assistance nor could she, through lack of personal resources, be considered a person of need."

HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","The appellant, McQueen Agencies Ltd., appeals from an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998. This order dismissed the appellant's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the respondent signed promissory note and tendered cheque for $10,870, being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. HELD: 1) This summary judgment was granted without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed with his action for an alleged loss of $38,585.00. However, there are a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action. The pleadings must be put in order. With regard to the appellant, having satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit v. Kostuchuk et al., 1994 CanLII 3870 (SK CA), [1994] 10 W.W.R. 89; 74 W.A.C. 89 (C.A.) at 272-273 and Winfield Developments Ltd. v. Banton Industries Ltd. (1996), 141 Sask. R. 21) is entitled to judgment for $ 10,870.00 with interest at the rate of 10%, as stipulated in the note, together with costs in Queen Bench on the applicable tariff and costs in this Court on single column 5. Since the respondent/plaintiff has not accepted the amount tendered in payment of the appra award, it's prayer for relief in its motion is amended to claim the full amount of the premiums payable. 2) In the circumstances, we must treat the counterclaim as an independent action. There has been significant delay in these proceedings and it will probably be many months or longer before the plaintiff’s action is tried. The appeal should be allowed in part. The appellant leaves to amend its statement of defence to the plaintiffs claim by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the SK Insurance Act (including any additional material facts pertaining to that defence) together with any new matters raised in the amended statement of claim. 3) Leave is also granted to each party to re-open the examinations for discovery for the purpose of examining on the new issues raised by any such amendments."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any recollection of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1)The evidence raised by the complainant was that he honestly believed he had the consent of the complainant to have sexual intercourse. The Court held that the lack of general intent or voluntariness resulted from self- induced intoxication. 2)The defence of extreme intoxication was successful in the rarest of cases. It was difficult to understand how someone who was so intoxicated could be capable of committing such an offence where the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the complainant is incapable of consciously controlling her behaviour. 3)The accused testified that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse until his sister was able to arouse him. He never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. Although he has referred to his Charter rights in his application, he acknowledges that the required notice has not been given and that he is not seeking a Charter remedy. He declines an adjournment to bring a Charter application and with the co-operation of the Crown, copies of the record were produced and filed with the court to enable the accused's review hearing under s. 520 of the Code to proceed. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. 1)The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably justified as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood he would commit a criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice. 2)The accused indicated that he wants to continue to pick or carry placards pending his trial. He stated that if the desired amendment was made he will restrict his picketing to lawful activity. Yet he maintains the picketing he did, which resulted in the charges on which he now has been released pending trial, was lawful."

To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge was the chambers judge on the return date. Given the nature of the cause of action, it was likely that more than the usual interlocutory relief would be sought from time to time by parties, much of which seeking directions not properly the subject of chambers motion proper, offered the view that counsel should seek the designation of case-management judge in the action. HELD: 1)The disclosure and production of the plaintiff's notice of motion was justified under the 'broad relevance' test and comports with the general principle that a party is entitled to discovery if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either of these consequences. 2)The plaintiff was required to answer certain questions outlined by the plaintiff, "". any proper questions arising therefrom, and proper questions seeking Mr. Krake's opinions on audit issues arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files"". 3)The questions alluded to, as well as audit working patterns related to investments made by Saskatchewan Trust and the requisite part of the document referred to as'matters for attention of partners as at December 31, 1985,"" must be disclosed. 4)The court ordered that the plaintiff attend for the resumption of examination for discovery of him and answer any questions that he refused to answer or took under advisement. 5)The Court ordered that hypothetical questions be asked of an expert within the limits heretofore alluded to."

He now moved for an order under Rule 15 staying execution and/or garnishment. The court granted the stay. The monies paid into the Court before this Rule 15 application launched will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.  1)The appellant should pay child support in the amount of $633 per month. 2)The respondent should pay costs in the sum of $450.
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed. At trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence requested that the court enter into a voir dire. Crown and defence counsel agreed that the Crown would call the witnesses. HELD: The accused's continued detention after the purported 'de facto' arrest constituted a de facto arrest. 1) The accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact a particular Legal Aid duty counsel. 2) There was no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he is the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter. 3) The Court found that there was an actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention which was transformed into an arrest. The Mann decision established that a common law power of investigative detention exists which allows police officers to briefly detain a person for investigative purposes, without advising the person of his right under Charter to retain and instruct counsel. There was, in the words of Lamer C.J., de facto detention. The accused considered himself deprived of his liberty to go where he pleases."
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","FIRE applied for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association Limited (REAL) from interfering with the applicant's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building as tenant from and after September 1, 1996.

c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.",At issue in this appeal is whether certiorari is available to challenge an investigation and whether the Commission should have the opportunity to take its complaints about the investigation to the courts. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed; application for fresh evidence dismissed. 1)The court must consider the appropriateness of the underlying judicial review application on this interlocutory appeal. The chambers judge essentially granted the applicant's application and dismissed the Commission's's. 2)The chambers judge should not have entertained the Commission’s interlocutors’ application. 3)The Court must also consider the importance of confidentiality in the investigative process. The contents of the return or the availability of discovery cannot meaningfully be assessed without some threshold examination of the merits.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the media, the Crown, the young person and the defendant sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public and the media will be permitted to attend a pre-sentencing conference scheduled to take place on December 11, 2006.

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975 (the 'agreement') between he and the respondent.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, receiving order ought not to have been made, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent personat the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to discharge him in such circumstances. Certain of the builders' lien claimants have already commenced an action. According to the trustee, the bankrupt has been far from model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of administration of the estate. The trustee maintains the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not effect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home. Certain builders' liens had already commenced action. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The court had not been convinced that it should exercise this discretion in favour of the bankrupt. 2)Having read the decision in Re Wale (1997) 1996 CanLII 8275 (ON SC), 45 C.B.R. (3d) 15 (Ont. S.C.) Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application for annulment of an assignment. There is likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. It also appears from the facts that the vast majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit. 3)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt because he has not yet filed a monthly financial statement and has been unable to make payments. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. It should also be mentioned that prior to bankruptcy the bankrupt attempted to deal with his financial problem through the orderly payment of debts. He also considered proposal post-bankruptcy but found out on an informal basis that it would be defeated. 4)The majority of secured creditors would benefit from the bankrupt`s request being granted. 5)If, as the bankrupt states, an annulments of his assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. The central issue is whether the Agreement is a lease or a security agreement. The issue was whether the trade-in as the advance payment (but the Agreement does not define it in that way) is a substantial sum. The value of the trade in does not equal the amount of advance payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9,320.67). To validate the early repossession in these circumstances would defeat the intention of the legislation to afford protection to farmers against loss of property interests without compliance with legislative provisions by creditors who are governed by the Act. If the Agreement was lease, the defendant was to have possession and the unrestricted right to use the sprayer (provided that he did not exceed 500 base hours annually in which event he agreed to pay $75 per excess hour). Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in a warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant did not file a statement of defence and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. The appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a notional claim to rights in 'common property' because the appellant will never be successful in obtaining from this Court the remedy of specific performance. The registration of miscellaneous interest is analogous to the registration of caveat protecting an interest under the former Land Titles Act.[3] Under that Act, the case law was well settled that an applicant seeking an order continuing a caveat was required to establish that he or she had an interest against the land against which the caveat was registered. In light of subsequent developments, the Court found nothing in the reasons of the Chambers judge which indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The chambers judge framed the issues in this manner: The preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. For the purposes of s.50 of The Land Tittles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under the Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest for a 'interest in land'. The appellant appealed. Title to Unit was transferred to the third party purchaser on October 9, 2007."

Section 737 states: 737. 1) An offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a Victim surcharge, in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. 2) The sentencing judge failed to comply with either the explicit provisions of the 737(1) or the implicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of Code. 3) The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under the Code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 730 relating to undue hardship.  4) If an offender is exempted from payment of the Victim Surcharge, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons.  5) When an offender establishes to the satisfaction of the court that undue hardship to the offender or the dependents of the offender would result from a payment of any such surcharge the court must give reasons to the sentencing judge. 6) The sentence is 15 years imprisonment with a maximum of 21 months in prison. 7) The maximum sentence imposed is 21 years of incarceration.  8) Victim surcharges are made in accordance with the terms of the 1995 Criminal Code. 9) The sentences imposed are 14 years and 1 year of probation.  10) The respondent has a life sentence of 21 years.  9) A sentence of 15 years is imposed on a person who pled guilty to the offence of failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to attend and complete an anger management program as required by a probation order made September 14, 2005.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge erred in holding that the police officer who made a demand for a sample of the appellant's breath had reasonable and probable grounds to make such a demand. The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn't make those observations or truly act upon them. The video confirms that she was correct in most of those observations. The appellant's claim for breach of the Charter must fail. 2) The evidence was not supported by the trial judge’s decision to exclude the bloodshot eyes and the remaining indicia which the officer could reasonably come to the conclusion that she did not make. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the decision was reasonable and supported by evidence. It was not clear that the officer observed the slurred speech of the respondent after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 3) The court was in a position to test the credibility of Cst. Forrester. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence.
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was arrested for impaired operation of motor vehicle, read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and Demand for Blood and was cooperative throughout. However, he had no recollection of the officer ever placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. HELD: The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins. The Crown concedes that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly and if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires me to exclude those statements. The concession made by the Crown is correct. The officer was not acting in good faith. Indeed, he did not know the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. He was interrogating the accused after he had been arrested, explained what he was doing, explained his rights, his rights to counsel and further warned him that he was not obligated to say anything further to the officer. The accused responded by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The police officer concluded that the evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of his section rights, must now determine if the evidence so gathered must be excluded from the trial pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter. This is a more difficult decision."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse following a trial before a judge and jury. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years. The pivotal evidence implicating the defendant came from the testimony of two former common law spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. Defence counsel initially argued that Vetrovec warning was mandatory and that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to caution the jury about the untrustworthiness of both the complainant and his friend. The trial judge did not give a warning in relation to either witness. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge must carefully assess the trustworthiness of Crown witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown. That said, the prosecution and my own counsel failed to appreciate the limitations on the inferences which could properly be drawn from the expert evidence. The jury should not place reliance upon the evidence of the Crown's witnesses without guidance from the judge as to dangers inherent in their testimony. The judge must give guidance to the jury as to the acknowledged wisdom of looking for independent supporting evidence when the witness in question had potential motive to lie under oath.  2)The defendant's credibility was inherently suspect and the importance of that witness's testimony to the Crown’s case were the main or prominent considerations."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT: This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in 1998. In carrying out that contract, the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendant commenced the action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order would have been made against the plaintiff. HELD: The order for security was granted and the defendant was ordered to post security. 1)The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for costs. 2)There is no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue. In general terms the statement of Madam Justice Fraser is just as applicable to an Ontario case as an Alberta one. 3)The respondent commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action in this case. 4)The plaintiff commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99) wherein $50k was posted as security for the costs. That was the result of a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely affect the plaintiff's opportunity to defend the action. 5)The counterclaim is not wholly distinct from the claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because the plaintiff is a non-resident party."
1998canlii13455.txt,"FIAT. At issue was what evidence of a prior action could be put before the jury. The trial was imminent. HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action. He did not intend to do so and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of by the parties. The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages sothat those issues would have to be traversed also. The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to the usual tonotice and admissibility. In that respect the applicant may choose to require the medical witnesses in question to appear in person, subject to usual rules as to costs. HELD: The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum of the release completed by her. Beyond the issue of privilege, which in itself is the more critical problem of revisiting that action, there is no doubt in my mind that the jury would ultimately be obligated to revisit the whole matter as preliminary to making a decision."

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The victim suffered bruising and soreness from the incident. HELD: A non-custodial sentence of less than 2 years was justified. The accused was prohibited from having any firearms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. 1)The Court of Appeal held that electronic monitoring was permitted only in cases where the accused appeared to meet the requirements of s. 742.1(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code. This principle was advanced in R. v. McLeod (1992), 109 Sask.R. 8; 81 C.C.c.(3d) 83 (C.A.). 2)The sentence was reduced from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that s. 530(3) of the Code is mandatory.","The issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either of the official languages of Canada pursuant to s. 530(1) of the Criminal Code. If so, what are the consequences of the failure to do so? HELD: The trial was held in English on October 13, 1998. The failure to advise the accused in his own language constitutes a procedural wrong. The accused's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his rights to trial was not procedural error. Section 530(3) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, sex, age or mental disability. The right of bilingual Canadians, who have the highest incidence of bilingualism, are the first persons that the section was designed to assist.

c_1991canlii4362.txt,"The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988. The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60. The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days. Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year.","The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties, a declaration of ownership regarding personal property and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust.

HELD: The court found that the respondent had met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment. The respondent was entitled to an interest in the assets of the defendant by virtue of unjust enrichment or constructive trust and the relief was part of the equitable jurisdiction of the court and did not depend on a contract or disposition of law."

He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The Crown contended the sentence inadequately reflected the element of deterrence and that it was inadequate having regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The sentence was not so manifestly inadequate. 2)Although obviously extremely lenient, the sentence is not the same as what the members of this Court felt they would have imposed different one; apart from misdirection or non-direction on the proper principles sentence should be varied only if the Court is satisfied that it is clearly excessive or inadequate in relation to the offence proven or to the record of the accused."

Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue in this appeal was the ownership of monies in a joint account in the names of the late Mrs. and Mrs. Scott. The appellant and the respondents were children of the deceased. All parties were self-represented on the appeal. The probate court judge made a determination when the evidence was not sufficient for him to do so, and based only on speculation and hearsay rather than as required in law. He did not rule on the appellant's allegations during the hearing of breach of trust and conflict of interest against the adminstratrix of the estate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence before the court was not that as required by this court. The standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge was palpable and overriding error. The same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless all the evidence is put forward, it is automatically gift to the survivor. In many cases where bank accounts are held jointly by parent and child, after the death of the parent the funds were determined by the court to belong to the estate and that further investigation into their ownership is required.  2) The court found no grounds for appellate intervention in the decision regarding ownership of the joint account."

In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. He was 53 years old at the time. The defendants admitted liability. They argued that the injuries had rendered the plaintiff totally and permanently disabled from the duties of his employment and for all employment in which he was capable of engaging by reason of education, training or experience. HELD: Leave to waive the clear requirements of C.P.R. 31.08 was granted. The court accepted the plaintiff's assessment of damages. It was not enough for the plaintiff to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel is sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was of the view that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The interpretation advanced by Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the respondent and favoured by the Chambers judge and my colleagues in the majority, was reasonable, but not patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Chambers judge's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation was reasonable. She was not empowered to interfere with the Board's decision unless it was 'patently unreasonable'. The conclusion respecting its unreasonableness must stand on its own, without being propped up by the reasonableness or correctness of the Pool interpretation or, for that matter, by its own wrongness."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to that of the respondent, even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. 1)The trial judge held that the mortgage instrument was an unregistered interest, but it did confer rights on the appellant and such rights were enforceable against the respondent in accordance with s. 54 of the Land Titles Act. 2)The respondent obtained priority over the appellant by virtue of the filing of its caveat. It was not intended, as between itself and the appellant, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to the appellant as a result of the covenant in the Grant Agreement between the respondent and the applicant. 3)The appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA.  4)The Court of Appeal disagreed on the following analysis."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","The three accused entered guilty pleas to breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46. HELD: A sentence of one year to 18 months was appropriate. The Crown was not in a position to delineate with any precision what each accused did in the house. The court was not able to attribute comments made to any individual accused. The three accused were found to be at medium risk to re-offend based on the circumstances of the offence and the 9-1-1 recording."

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.",The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media had requested access to the file and requested that it be sealed to protect their reputation and to protect the respondent's reputation against unproven allegations that may be contained in the file. HELD: The court found that the salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order.
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed term agreement and that the landlord was legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appellant landlord appeals a decision made by the hearing officer on two questions of law: 1) that the Hearing Officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The Residential Tenancy Act, 2006 in finding the tenancy was not fixed-term agreement and thereby committed an error of law. The hearing officer also erred in holding that the fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated an fixed term. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to re-renting it. He spent the same amount on the unit and obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent.  2) With respect to the appellant's failure to mitigate, counsel for the appellant relies on the case of 10113307 Saskatchewan Ltd. v. Mattison, 2012 SKQB 22 (CanLII), [2012] S.J. No. 22 (QL), decision in which Gerein J. noted that s.8(2)of the Act reverses this onus and places the same on the person claiming the loss.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with fishing for or for sustenance in violation of s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence. The evidence presented to the Court was that the co-op, with the authority of the provincial government, managed and had sole discretion in determining who was eligible to acquire a commercial fishing licence. The Crown argued that this was an important area for conservation and sustainable management for the Canoe Lake walleye population and that the closure of the fishing area was reasonably justified."
4_1999canlii12738.txt,"The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity. The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the letter was tantamount to an admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and that he attempted to manufacture an alibi by eliciting false testimony from a potential witness. There was no other explanation for the request for the false evidence to be given. The letter admitted fact which was against the accused's interest and was exculpatory. The accused expressly said in his letter that he had no doubt that the motorcyclist on the second occasion, the person reported to the police at the station and the person identified in the prisoner's docket at the preliminary inquiry and at trial (having been remanded in custody) were the same person."
5_2002skqb213.txt,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows:.. 36% interest in trucking company called 'Titan Transport Ltd.' HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and house cleaning. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. She has requested a 50% increase in support, because the income has increased roughly 50% even without regard to the shareholder bonus. There is also the fact that certain of his expenses for travel and auto expenses are now paid by the company."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.",HELD: The Court held that s. 2(g) of the Matrimonial Property Act (MPA) did not infringe on the appellant’s right to equal division of the parties’ assets. The Court also held that marital status was not an analogous ground upon which to base a claim for discrimination under s. 15(1) as it was not discrimination under the Charter.
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.",HELD: The Court found that the boys were placed for adoption. The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoptions. The Court believed that the evidence indicated that the accused had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that the Court had no doubt concluded the Stevens home met the necessary standard. 1) The Court was also of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. It was also concluded that the respondent had the skills to cohere to routine. 2) It was not necessary for the Court to remind the Court that it has a moral and legal duty to ensure that foster homes have the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in such a home.
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. He had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to traffic. He began drug use in his late teens. He was previously convicted of a designated substance offence. 2) the accused had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so. He appeared to have made little productive contributions to society or to his own advancement. 3) Prior charges, convictions and incarcerations did not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. 4) The accused was convicted of having in his possession quantities of cocaine and marijuana for the purposes of trafficking, which were part of the proceeds of the offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code. 5) There were few mitigating circumstances that the court could and should properly take into account in reaching its sentencing decision. The court gave the accused credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent on remand to a total of 23 months, 21 days credit. The amount involved was $16,325.98 which was transferred to the accused’s counsel at his request to pay his legal fees."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the custody and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment, which provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of the matrimonial property estate of the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage.

HELD: The respondent was dismissed as the sole custodian of the child. 1)The mere passage of time would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. 2)The petitioner was now 15 years old whereas at the time of the 1995 judgment she was merely six years old. 3)The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support."

Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors for failing to call an available expert witness to testify at her original civil trial. The defendants were engaged and retained to represent and defend her in respect of four charges laid by the College of Physicians and Surgeons against her; three charges alleging she engaged in the practice of medicine and one charge that she provided medical treatment not being registered under the Medical Professions Act. The plaintiff appealed the Provincial Court judgment to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal and Court of Appeal and ultimately she sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, all appeals and applications being dismissed. HELD: 1)The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non-suit. The jury therefore had no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiff in the evidence that she presented. 2)The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at the trial dealt with the very complicated and difficult issue of the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in regard of the preparation for and conduct of the plaintiff's trial in what is known as a quasi-criminal statutory offence (QPRA). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise, knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","HELD: The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. The Crown held that the complainant was the common-law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She had been to her neighbour's house several times and was upset and crying throughout the time she was at the complainant's residence. The complainant had a fresh injury which was bleeding, there was fresh blood on the floor and she stated that the accused put his hands on her neck in an attempt to strangle her. She said she tipped over and tipped over; she did not say how she got free. The officer testified that he did not have an opportunity to observe the declarant in the making of the statement. The court found that the test for reliability was met when the complainant recanted on an earlier statement."

Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The Crown had not played the CD for the sentencing judge. Now, the journalists wished to view that evidence. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant that it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. HELD: The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Court of Queen's Bench was the appropriate venue to obtain such relief. The Attorney General did not oppose the application. It merely sought the court order to release the CD to the applicant.  1) The applicant was entitled to make a copy of the CD at its expense.

The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the respondent-mother was in need of protection pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of the Child and Family Services Act. The Ministry sought leave to withdraw on grounds unrelated to the client's eligibility for legal aid services. Counsel for the parents argued that the Ministry had not been able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for C.T.’s needs.

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay.

The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G.

3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in December 1997. Each of the parties had significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased since that date. The respondent's assets then, and at time of application, were greater in value than those of the petitioner. HELD: 1) The petitioner is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being:➢ One-half of the amount of the condominium $42,000.00.   1) There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. 2) The respondent takes the position that the petitioner is not entitled to any distribution because of their agreement at the marriage that each would maintain their own assets separately and not make claim on the assets of the other.  3) The only evidence in writing of their intentions is the respective wills executed shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to their respective children."
2_2007skqb337.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The accused appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the accused's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside. 1) The evidence which led the trial judge to conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway #11 was inconsistent. It was the defence's theory at trial, and Fleury's unwavering statement given to Cst. Poiré later that afternoon that he was travelling south on Highway 2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and swerved to miss deer that had come onto the highway. 2) There was no evidence to support the Crown's conclusion that Fleury swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs. The Crown could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the accused could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst.'Poiré. It seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two or three lanes it had to travel before leaving the pavement. 3) The trial judge was not circumspect about the explanation given to Fleury by Fleury. It seemed unlikely that the defence could make such a right turn without leaving the tire tracks. 4) The jury was not able to draw a rational conclusion from the evidence at trial. The evidence from the scene could not be drawn beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury could not rely on the evidence called by the police to prove the accused drove through the stop sign. 5) The Court was not convinced that the Crown could have drawn a reasonable conclusion from what Fleury had testified. 6) It was also not reasonable to conclude the accused was travelling at a high speed across the four lanes of traffic. 7) There could be no rational conclusion as to why Fleury would have chosen to roll over and swerve into the slough."

Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the Hearing Officer is set aside and the matter is remitted to the hearing officers for a re-examination. The tenants' application for possession was filed before the order for possession issued and it has stayed execution of the order pending appeal. The portions of the affidavit which relate to legal error are not admissible and will be disregarded. The principal argument advanced by the tenants is that in both deciding the merits of the landlord's application and in fashioning an appropriate remedy the Hearing officer failed to take into account the alleged bed bug infestation, associated problems and expenses incurred. Subsections 70(6) and (11) are relied upon as sources of equitable discretionary authority available to the applicant hearing officer which should have been considered and appropriately applied.

She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused's conduct was not an isolated incident or even restricted to few occasions. The evidence established that the sexual assaults occurred over several years, many times. The test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The victims have no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions. This finding was supported by the rest of the evidence."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel disburse the funds from two mortgage brokers to the project. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the mortgagees.

The second mortgagee, who had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support, requested that the drawings from the third mortgage broker be confined to four or five draws. The first draw was contemplated for the end of March and its proceeds were to be used to pay off all accounts 60 days and over in full as per the prepared list of the mortgage brokers. The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of undertaking. HELD: The plaintiffs had not established a basis for a claim under breach of trust on this ground. Any claim under this ground was dismissed. 1)The defendant's conduct throughout his retainer as solicitor for the project was one of conscientiousness and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through various irrevocables letters of directions. 2)There was no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. 3)The plaintiff was awarded damages for disbursements of mortgage advances. 4)The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for breach of Trust.

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so and was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of 1 year, 5 months and 8 years, respectively. The Crown requested that the court make an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code which would require the accused serve one half of his sentence for the offence. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and the three cases the Crown was primarily relying upon in support of its position that a 15 year sentence was appropriate. 2) The accused had a lengthy criminal record including 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was able to determine that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. The Court was also able to conclude that although the accused had longstanding unresolved issues regarding his upbringing and was very resentful of his community, these factors were confirmed within the Gladue Report prepared by the Crown. It was also possible to tie the hands of the Correctional Service Canada (CSC) in the handling of Gordon's programming while in penitentiary addressing his multiple complex needs, the vast majority of which are Gladue related."

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

HELD: An interim distribution order granted the wife exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the respondent was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. An earlier consent order forbade the husband from disposing of the property. Since then, the husband has continued to dispose of farm machinery and the 1994 crop. He has not offered any of the money earned to support his children. The respondent is ordered to provide periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. The evidence presented by the wife is simply her assertion that her husband has been earning money which enables him to pay periodic support. He denies it. She also asks that half the value of the crop, $200.00 per month for each of the children, retroactive to July 1, be denied the right to enter his tool shed now that he is finished farming for the year.

HELD: The application for leave is taxed against the applicant and the proposed third party.  1)The applicant's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. [2] Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice.

There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as a party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant. Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action is different in nature and may cover a different time period and/or an employee so that the extent of the third party's involvement will vary from case to case.

It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment. 1)The defendant was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The evidence established the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing.  2)Rule 488 sets out the test for a summary judgment. 3)In the case of a person who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-maintained one. 4)In this case the plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward.

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a parked vehicle were careless. He could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would be so close in front of him and backed up to assist another officer on a non-priority matter in the south-west part of the province. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that the accused had shown on a balance of probabilities that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The standard of proof in this case was whether the Crown has proved that Mr. Tyndall, who is on duty in a marked police car, immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused and immediately took steps both to assist the officer by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene. 3) The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the accused's vehicle. He was not shouting at the officer. Neither seat belt, belonging to the officer, locked upon striking the officer and the officer did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking him."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant, Guardian Insurance Company of Canada, is the general liability insurer of the respondent Kellogg Canada Inc. (""Kellogg""). The respondent is the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. Mr. McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, his company's vehicle had a deflated tire. He was sued by his employer. The chambers judge refused to defend the plaintiff on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. The plaintiff appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. An examination of the duty to defend in light of the Nichols decision would appear to be beneficial."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The Crown argued that the evidence was relevant and admissible because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought and, therefore, the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused argued that because the offence before the court is not one specified in the authorization, the intercepted communication was non-conscriptive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. Even if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There has been a breach of s. 7 of the Criminal Code and therefore the evidence obtained should be excluded. 1)The evidence was not conscriptive and was not admissible. 2)There was insufficient evidence before the judge to issue the telephone intercept authorization.  3)The accused's application for exclusion was dismissed on the basis the evidence of the conversation was admissible and should not be excluded under s.24(2)."

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S.17.1 (the 'Farm Security Act') provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Act. HELD: The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again and promptly thereafter expired. The applicant shall have the taxable costs of her application against the respondent. 1) The Limitations Act requires debtors and contractual obligees to commence enforcement proceedings within the applicable limitation period, failing which the right to enforce is lost. The legislature could not have intended what the respondent argues. The purpose of the Act is to provide farmers protection from the loss of their farm lands where short-term economic conditions have created temporary financial problems, not to provide mortgagees of farm lands with a mechanism to make limitation periods eternally inapplicable to their mortgages. This absurd result would not flow just to the respondent in its unique circumstances. Acceptance of the respondent's interpretation of the Farm security Act would lead to a situation where any and all mortgagees could entirely avoid any limitation period applying to their mortgage by the simple devise of serving notice of intention under the Act."

Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary.

The medical reports on file indicated that there was no objective medical evidence to suggest that the infant's injuries would cause any permanent discomfort or disability.

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The trial judge did not err in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 2)The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, decided to allow the appellant's appeal and order a new trial."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The students' union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Students' Union sought to overturn the Chambers judge's order. The chambers judge dismissed the students' application and found that the respondent did not have standing to bring his application. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The Chambers judge made no errors in his approach to the application of s. 225 of the Act.  1)It is important not to confuse the statutory concepts of oppression, unfairly prejudicial actions and actions which unfairly disregard interests with respect to the referendum result. 2)Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3)The Chambers judge erred in finding that the student's Union Council had 'imposed its own preordained outcome' by endorsing the referendum outcome. 4)No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum.

c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under s.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). HELD: The trial judge entered a judicial stay on the.08 charge without determining either guilt or innocence. The only de jure appeal before this Court is that brought against the impaired driving conviction. With respect to that conviction, the appellant seeks to have it set aside and either an acquittal entered or a new trial ordered by virtue of alleged reliance by the trial judge on the readings contained in the Certificate of Analysis; consideration by the Court of Appeal of evidence arising subsequent to the breath demand.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","The respondent, under the provisions of the Education and Health Tax Act and the Department of Revenue and Financial Services Act, conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax in the amount of $37,842.07. Husky appealed the Board's decision which upheld the assessment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. 1)The Board's finding that the Appellant fails to meet the requirements of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act and is therefore not entitled to claim an exemption. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)The evidence before the Board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase of the valves and one cannot avoid the tax consequence by allocating the price to alleged components or by separately invoicing various charges. 3)On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. The Crown appealed the conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge did not err in his reasons. He did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. The trial judge focused on the fact that there were two officers present and did not address the accused's assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing. The force used by the appellant in reacting to the perceived threat was justified. 2)The appellant's reasons did not reflect an inconsistency. At no point did the trial judge find the appellant's mistake of fact to be reasonable. He engaged in classical alternative reasoning and held that even if the accused had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tribunal found that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place; the tribunal also found that it was not responsible for the discrimination against the applicant. The applicant had been a casual employee for 16 years and had been employed by the City for 15 years. He had received 4% less in wages than other city employees because of his disability; the court also compensated the applicant in the amount of $8,902.00."

5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent.

Employees who retired from any employer during the term of the agreement shall be entitled to retroactive wages from every employer for whom he had worked during the period. The phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. The arbitrator concluded in his ratio that the phrase 'any employer' in the context of this collective agreement is an unambiguous one. This is an incorrect proposition of law.

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the father's total income to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983. In 2003, the total amount of child maintenance was $5,000. In 2004, the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the father in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges portion of the vehicle is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as personal use should be 50 percent. Evidence was led that the father used the vehicle to efficiently combine personal and business use whenever he could. In looking at the last three years in total, the truck cost was listed at $23,283 with depreciation taken of $18,855 to date. The father testified that he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement. This along with significant personal use makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost of allowance claimed in each of the years in question which will result in an addition to income in 2003 of $2,882; in 2004, $3,829; in 2005, $1,733; and in 2006, $4,733. The Court awarded the petitioner mother $24,300. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is a three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father’s personal farming statement. Each party achieved partial success in their approach to the issue of maintenance. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable."

However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs.

For example, part at least, of his failure to produce documentation arises from the sorry state of his records. Counsel for Bawolin argues that these costs should be left to the discretion of the trial judge. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs of $50,000 plus tax. 2)The Court would conclude, once the whole story is revealed, that the legal costs incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to any gain which Siemens could reasonably have expected to achieve.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants brought an application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the 'Charter') in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application was granted. The Court's jurisdiction to grant a remedy under the Offender Complaint and Grievance System was narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the correctional service of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the way the Correctional Services of Canada manages an inmate's sentence as is the case here."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","A divorce and matrimonial property hearing was held. The parties were married in 1960 and separated in 1989. They had two children, aged 18 and 19 years of age. At the conclusion of the hearing and oral argument, the parties agreed that there was no possibility of reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing. The court found that there were no factors that had been established under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act to warrant an equal division. The respondent sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so as to increase the maintenance provision and at the same time retain the asset division in her favor.

It was not an indebtedness that should be taken into account in determining the division of matrimononial assets and liabilities."

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the plaintiffs for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. HELD: The Court held that a determination of liability in favour of the defendants will render determination of the issue of damages unnecessary; given the quantum of damages claimed and the volume of evidence necessary to prove this aspect of the claim, the prior determination would not result in any significant delay in the overall management of the action. 1)An application for severance of issues should only be granted for the most compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action; 2)The Court found that a trial of liability was required in order to determine damages. 3)A separate trial of issues was not necessary."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The parties were married in 1993 and had two children, aged 12 and 7.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts.

Counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 were dismissed. 1)There was no evidence that the accused had the authority under s. 27 of the Act to revoke his licence or to prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times. 2)The accused did possess a fishing licence, valid on its face. He acted in compliance with that licence.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. He found that the daughter had withdrawn from the father's charge and that there was no order or agreement for the father to pay child support in the amount of $3,644.00. 2) The evidence did not show that the mother unilaterally withdrew from the relationship with the father. Nor was there a significant misapprehension of the evidence with respect to the issue."

The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price to be paid for goods and services. The amount sought was unreasonable. 2) The defendant properly pointed out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared and that it had, therefore, incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 3) There was no evidence as to how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. The parties were in general agreement that parts which would cost a significant amount would not be purchased by the plaintiff unless it had first discussed the matter with the defendant.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. The parties were parents of three children, ages 8, 9 and 10. The respondent requested an increase in the basic child support payment, including retroactive child support, and determination of the eligible expenses and proportionate share of s.7 expenses. The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in failing to take into account the total costs of the children's extracurricular activities, which were ordinary expenses and thus included in the table amount fixed by s.3(1)(a) of the Guidelines."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April 2000 which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The question of whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages was of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. 2)The employer sought an order setting aside the orders of the Board upon the grounds that their decisions are patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and further because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. 3)Appellate courts are unanimous in instructing the reviewing courts to show deference to the expertise of the reviewing judge because of its experience in the field. However, if the reviewing court is to have any function at all it must be able to assess the decision by some standard. The test of'substantial compliance' would involve consideration of the purpose of the time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from failure to comply. 4)The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not, in light of the late decision, of a breach of Natural justice."
d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years.

He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. 1)The plain meaning of the section is such that there is no need to resort to other principles of statutory interpretation; however, if it were necessary to do so, the plain meaning interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1) as not applying in circumstances where sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple “designated offence” convictions and the offender’s criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a designated offence. The judge therefore declined to order the accused, who had been convicted for a repeat offence, to comply for life. 2)Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.

The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The fines were excessive for the offences committed. 2)The maximum fine imposed was 724 days. 3)The Court of Appeal did not find that the sentence was “demonstrably unfit”. Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on July 25, 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he was not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. Counsel for SGI submitted that the weighted average approach in calculating the respondent's gross yearly employment income sets the IRB much lower than that of the appellant's. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs.  1)The respondent stands for just this proposition. But, in that case, the court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. This position is based on employment promised to the appellant which would have commenced during the first 90 days. If the appellant was entitled to benefits other than what SGI has paid him, he is awarded interest on the value of those benefits not paid, from June 1, 2001 to date. SGI did not receive information from the appellant regarding promised employment until that date, where the income is annualized, indexed and adjusted pursuant to s28. Other evidence leads to conclusion that the appellant would not have actually been employed at $17 per hour for 60 hours per week for the entire 180 day period. 2)The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour averaging 34.25 hours. Over that six-week period, the non-earner never worked close to 60 hours. The average work week was 34. 25 hours. 3)SGI submits that SGI's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather is not less than the time that Montgrand would have actually worked. 4)The relevant provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, c. A-35, Reg are as follows: s. 19(1)An income replacement benefits for non- earners to be calculated pursuant to section 116 of the PIBR are to be determined based solely on the time the victim would have been employed during the 1,180 days. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant to this case. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which the IR"
6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The parties married in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 3, 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved. The respondent was the biological child of the parties. The issue for the Court was whether Tristen is a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The respondent asserts that the child is “child of a marriage” and seeks child support for him from Delorey. HELD: 1)The threshold for parental status finding must be pegged at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of access and custody rights except where the step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent and in substantial substitution for that natural parent's role. In this case, the respondent is the parent of Ella. 2)The respondent's evidence contradicted the assertion that the natural mother did not take any, or at least any significant, part in the children's lives."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT.

The plaintiff sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. HELD: The plaintiffs' applications were granted. Each of the defendants had furnished a draft order varying in substance varying given the parties involved. The draft orders were to issue as an order of the court save and excepting the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature on my part to award costs at this stage. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than am able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","HELD: The Court found that the child support order was not retroactive to August 2000 and that retroactive support should be fixed at $1,500. The issue of child support was mixed and as such there was no order as to costs. The Court ordered that the petitioner's income for child support purposes be $35,269.44 and that he should pay his 59% share of the ongoing costs of [N.G.K.B.]'s participation in gymnastics, music program through the University of Saskatchewan, swimming and craft camp."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The court raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction to issue the vesting order applied for in these circumstances. Neither HSBC nor the applicant trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. Counsel requested the opportunity to address the concerns raised and to make supplementary submission in support of its application. Based upon the submissions now received from counsel, the court is satisfied that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of The Land Titles Act, 1978, c. L-5.1 is nevertheless reintroduced by the Land Title Conversion Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S. 2000, Reg. 2 and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders."

The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married in 1987 and separated for the final time in 1995. The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. Both parties agreed that the application for dissolution of the marriage proceed pursuant to the counter-petition. HELD: 1) The children were to reside in the joint custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.  2) The court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.",The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct the employee on how to unplug a moving fan blade. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in receiving pit. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect the employee. The accused must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a prima facie breach of the duty of care has occurred to ensure that the employee is made aware of every known or foreseeable health or safety hazard.
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. The accident occurred on October 25, 1998. Both the plaintiff and the driver were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The releases were given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel), the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident and driver of the vehicle involved. The two plaintiffs were paid $25,000 for their injuries as well as a $5,000 settlement for the driver and $7,500 for their insurer. Both parties had agreed to the terms of the settlement and agreed to it voluntarily. They should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. This is indeed what could result based on the defence filed on behalf of GMCL. HELD: Both “Fraser River” conditions were satisfied and GMCL should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injury by Citadel.

HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: 1)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. 2)The Town Council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition, including tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. There was no evidence that the council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of a municipal government. 3)The respondents acted in bad faith and in support of their submission that the original motion to accept the proposal in principle was declared null and void. 4)The court reviewed the material filed by the applicants and found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera'.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The respondent sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The respondent appealed the decision to strike the claim. The Court held that, without a challenge to legislation, the Municipality does not create a justiciable issue by referring in the claim to s.36 of the Constitution Act, when the commitments set out in that section do not alter the Legislature's right to exercise legislative authority. A general attack on “government” action, alleging that the Nova Scotia regime is constitutionally deficient, is too vague a basis for a court to determine under s.52 of the Act that law “is inconsistent with the provisions” and “of no force or effect.” The court also held that the respondent’s proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Charter could not be struck summarily because it was not plain and obvious that the claim would fail."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. At the end of the trial, the plaintiff asked to withdraw his claim against him. HELD: 1)The defendant's commission was 10% inclusive of project management. The commission was subject to HST. In the absence of an enforceable agreement between the parties, the Plaintiff was entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. 2)The plaintiff was to provide an overview of the marketing services provided by the defendant. 3)The issue of AA Walters' commission came up in the discussions with the plaintiff. The defendant carried on business as a licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg. He is the President of the Company. The Company is the listing broker for the property. The parties had agreed that AA Walters would be compensated for its service both in the development of the lands in question and the sale of the lots on the basis of commission of 10% of the selling price of lots payable upon the completion of each sale. There was no discussion of any break-down of the 10% as the commission structure was negotiable. 4)The Court was satisfied that the defendant was honestly in error."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the child and directed the matter to pre-trial conference."

The statements of claim alleges malicious defamation on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to establish that. Counsel for the defendant submits that the affidavits filed serve to negative malice. Do not agree. Accordingly, cannot say the claim is vexatious or frivolous."

The date and courtroom number for the trial on the note given to him by court staff were inverted and he appeared in Small Claims Court the day following its dismissal. The defendants declined to consent to an order directing a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered in Small Claims Court without order as to costs. A plaintiff should not be deprived of a trial because of an institutional scheduling error. The principles set out in Horosko v. Huber were applicable.,"The appellant/plaintiff’s claim in Small Claims Court was dismissed by the learned Provincial Court judge for want of prosecution. The small claims summons was returnable on August 6, 1998 and the respondents/defendants appeared in court on that date in response to it. The appellant was aware that the date on the summons was August 6. But he appeared in accordance with the particulars of a note previously given to him by court staff indicating that the trial of his claim would take place on August 7, 1998. It appears the misunderstanding occurred because the date and court room number were inverted on the note. The respondents declined to consent to an order directing a new trial even if the order awarded costs to them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the trial was ordered. A plaintiff should not be deprived of his day in court because of an institutional scheduling error which arose through no fault on the plaintiff‘s part. defendant in the circumstances should consent to a trial directing new trial so that the claim can be presented and its merits determined by the court. The plaintiff in such circumstances has no recourse but to appeal to this court and incur the attendant expense to obtain relief to which he is entitled. Although the facts of the appeal are somewhat different, the principles set out in Horosko v. Huber (1993), 1993 CanLII 8893 (Q.B.) are applicable. The appeal is allowed. A new trial is ordered."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.",The accused took the stand in his own defence and was convicted of robbery. The Court of Appeal sentenced him to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years probation. He appealed the sentence. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of robbery and that the offence was most serious.
6_1993canlii4548.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The action was commenced for alleged breach of contract of a written contract between the parties and damages for unjust enrichment. The plaintiff was in the business of manufacturing, selling and leasing signs and had a construction facility in Toronto, Ontario. The defendant, Nova, sold and services tractor trailers, and other large trucks in Nova Scotia, particularly in the Truro area. Nova had previously operated its business on the Brookside Road, north of Truro, and in 1984 moved to a new location adjacent to the McClure Mills Interchange. Nova was contacted by the defendant in an effort to obtain approval for the sign. Nova refused and the sign was removed. Nova appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff or its employees. The contract between Nova and the defendant was valid and existing and the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for the use of the existing sign for 74 months. Nova did not prove the appropriate legislation and regulations but am convinced that can take judicial notice thereof by virtue of Section ll of the Evidence Act of the Province of Nova Scotia."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the claim arising from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the financer held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that it became a tenant at sufferance and was obliged to pay rent. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The PPSA does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. It is consistent with the regime established pursuant to it. Section 36 provides only that a person with an interest in land may refuse permission to remove goods until he or she has received adequate security for reimbursement of damages caused by their removal. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture on the property prior to it being constructed, it had changed its position as of September 1, 1999. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town of Prince Albert Land Titles Office. 2)The trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) to (16). The Credit Union took the position that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to allow the removal of the building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes. 3)Gari's claims in this regard must fail."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the Respondent on a charge of impaired driving on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The Crown did not question the credibility of either of the officers. The trial judge found the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as a roadside screening test, and the issue was not pursued at the hearing of this appeal."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in cocaine pursuant to ss. 5(1)(of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, SC 1996, 19). He was sentenced to 7.5 years in custody and prohibited from applying for parole before the expiry of three years. He appealed his conviction. HELD: The accused's first ground of appeal was based on the Crown's refusal to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow a review of recently disclosed and discovered documents. The Court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that the Court is not in the position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available to the Court."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.",The plaintiffs were in a common law relationship and they had spent the evening visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The motor vehicle accident occurred when the defendant's police vehicle turned left in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. The destruction prevented the plaintiffs from examining the headlights. The plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights of the vehicle. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that Ms. Hawes is contributory to the accident. 1) The evidence from the lay witnesses and the evidence of the RCMP officer who attended the scene did not support the conclusion that the lamps were in operation. The exhibits were destroyed. 2) The Court found that the destruction of the exhibits was bad faith on the part of the defendant. It could be described as an erroneous act or negligent act but accept that which the defendant stated in his evidence and conclude he made a mistake but not for the purpose of permitting the defendants to gain advantage over the plaintiffs in this proceeding.
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner $1,945.00 plus an award of costs of $5,000.00. The Court directed that the matrimonial home be divided equally. The petitioner argued that the prior ownership of the home by the parties, which they never lived in, must be distributed equally unless am satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance; or unfair to the spouse who has custody of the children.

b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper. He was dismissed from his employment without notice in December 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified. The defendant had satisfied the onus with respect to six factors. 1)The failure to distribute the rules in writing was crucial. The onus was on the defendant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that there was just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff. 2)The employees were warned that further breaches of the policies would not be tolerated. There was no evidence presented by the plaintiff that the additional breaks he took were for his meal. 3)There was no reasonable excuse for the defendant's dismissal. The company acknowledged that the plaintiff had been abusing his break time for several years and the company, apparently, did nothing about it. The implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. 4)The breach of company rules or company policies can also be a cause for discharge. The plaintiff was dismissed without notice. 5)The defendant was not justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the company's overtime policy. 6)The employee was not given sufficient warning that termination would result if he breached the rules."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs out of the estate. The mother and daughter were now acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation'. It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The father sought solicitor and client costs against his son. The three parties will bear their own costs. The estate was required to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the Estate and the wills he drafted. Considering all of the circumstances, the representatives of the estates should be entitled to recover their solicitor, client and suo motu costs from the estate and the proceeds from the sale of the condominium."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff says his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made intentionally and maliciously by the defendants. HELD: 1)The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 2)The court accepted the plaintiff's defence of 'unfounded and without substance' and ordered that none of the parties should receive costs. 3)Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between CUPE and the University, the university was supposed to designate certain bulletin boards as union bulletin boards. As of October 2006, this had not been done. The administrator of the veterinary hospital had not only refused to prevent the harassment but had been an active part of the harassment himself. The words accuse the plaintiff of refusing to prevent harassment and also of taking an part in the harassment of Ms. Bowman. The impugned wording is all the more troubling because the plaintiff was the director of the VTH and accordingly, the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The conviction is set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered. 1)The trial judge erred in holding that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. 2)The appellant was not aware of the reason why he attended to the police station and gave the information. Constable Louvel testified that it was his understanding Mr. Chow did so to give an accident report. 3)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and arguedbefore the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. The issue now raised is an important issue and impacts directly and perhaps conclusively upon the conviction of the appellant. The determination of the Charter issue is at the heart of this case."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years of age at the time of the accident and had just passed a pedestrian crossing the street. He was driving a light colored Audi that passed him at a high rate of speed. The pedestrian was thrown from the vehicle. The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a sentence in the low end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be served inthe community rather than in a corrections facility.  1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him resulted in tragic consequences. For whatever reason, he failed to exercise his right to be free from alcohol and drugs and drove at speed in excess of 60 km/hr.  2)The court found that incarceration should be limited to 18 months and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT. The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants are granted their application to have the plaintiffs' claim severed so that the threshold issue of liability shall be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages. The plaintiffs also seek an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: 1)The court found that the claims and counterclaims arose as a result of one of the defendants leaving the employ of the plaintiff’s consulting partnership and by competing with the plaintiffs. 2)The Court considered the effect of disclosure on promoting settlement between the parties. The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application. 3)In Saskatchewan, authority to sever the issues at trial is founded on the Court of Queen”s Bench inherent jurisdiction. While other provinces, such as Ontario, have specific rules addressing the withholding of disclosure until after an issue has been determined, our court has not."

The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court found that the accused did not have in his possession child pornography. The court ordered the arrest of the accused on the basis of the information obtained through the sharing of file sharing software."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","HELD: The court found that the parties had reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. The parties agreed that the meeting was without prejudice. The court reviewed the contents of the document and indicated that it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues. It was premature at this point to make any determination as to whether the respondent remains under employed."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss in an automobile collision, a judge awarded damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. Since liability was admitted by the defendant, the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in admitting the evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence which resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. HELD: The award for damages to replace the lost stream of income cannot be calculated simply by totalling the sum of periodic payments. In the absence of agreement between the parties this Court has no jurisdiction to assess the damages, should it be decided that the award cannot stand. 1)The appellant's argument on future loss of income should not have been put to the jury in the guise of expert testimony. 2)The trial judge's decision to award the award for impaired earning capacity was so inordinately high that it was perverse, wholly out of proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was not required to interpret the words of the lease but could deal with the issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether insurance should cover the damage. 2)The arbitration clause in the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration but only disputes involving the clauses or provisions of a lease. 3)There was no evidence that the principles of waiver and estoppel applied as against the Tenant in these circumstances.

The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes v.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.255(1.3) and s.253(1(b)) of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court held that there was no breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. The only issue to resolve was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. Based on the totality of the above evidence, the Court found that the demand for breath samples amounted to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The Court also held that any potential violation of the accused's rights would fall toward the lower end of the spectrum."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The grounds relied on by the appellant gave rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjud adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract? (2) Whether the judge exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work? (3) The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at his conclusions. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)Cajon's president did not examine his company's lease (which was not produced at the hearing) in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the Respondent and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. Rather, Mr. Johns simply contacted the franchisor and was told that his employees should have followed the rules imposed upon Zellers employees. This does not seem reasonable on the part of the president in the circumstances. It has seven-year employee who presumably had performed her work satisfactorily and the only efforts by the employer were to ask Zellerers whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchiseisor. An employer surely must be expected to make further inquiries and to engage in further efforts to ensure that it can comply with its obligations under the employment contract (i.e. to permit its employees access to the workplace) before it can claim that it is incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 2)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the terms had not been frustrated by her conduct. 3)The appellant acted within its jurisdiction when deciding what terms of employment were and whether the terms should have been subject to proper notice."

The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants were convicted of unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The trial judge held that the appellants as Indians within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with an artificial light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or s. 901 of the Code. 2)The appellant had aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. The NRTA in 1930 altered those hunting rights. The provisions of the Wildlife Act altered those rights by eliminating commercial hunting; by expanding the hunting area to include all unoccupied Crown land; and by authorizing the Province to make conservation laws. 3)The respondent acknowledges that if Metis are Indians they enjoy hunting rights within s. 12 of the NRTA. Their argument is that they are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied crown land."

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007 allowing the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently and she appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: The damages were set at $862.50. Based on the Director's evidence, she discounted the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing. The Tenant will accordingly be entitled to judgment against the landlord for that revised amount.  1)The Director was essentially correct in her discounting of value of items of value. She was not credible and her explanation is not probable. 2)On a strong balance of probabilities that there was mould, that it was the landlord's responsibility to rectify same, and that she did not. Further find that the mould damaged the tenant's furniture, an area rug, various boots and articles of clothing and the clothing were ruined. 3)The Court rejected the director's evidence entirely. It was not reasonable to believe that she would have engaged in such a tactic. Having heard and assessed her as credible, the Court rejected her explanation entirely.

9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The applicant was the survivings spouse of the deceased who died in a motor vehicle accident. Any benefits she was entitled to were in accordance with the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, as amended by the Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the deceased's gross yearly employment income rather than on his gross income. Her counsel appealed the decision. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The interpretation suggested by SGI was appropriate when calculating the benefit for the surviving spouse for dependent children. 2)SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 3)The deceased's net income was $51,343. The death benefit was derived from a 'weekly income replacement benefit' calculated by the deceased calculated on a specific formula. The deceased received a death benefit equal to 50% of that net income.  4)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objects.  5)The language used in s.146(1) of the Act for calculating the deceased spouse's death benefit causes special problems.

It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender and the contract was awarded to another tenderer who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports.

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.",The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s.37(c) of the Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted with the condition that the children be returned to the father. The father was to continue living with the mother and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems.  1) The father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property offences but primarily related to failing to comply with recognizances and probation orders. His last conviction was in January 2006 for failing to provide adequate drug screen results. 2) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that they be returned in his care.

He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.",The accused was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The accused testified that his fear that he will re-offend in a violent or sexual offence is real and poses an imminent danger to himself and others. HELD: The accused was remanded to November 12. The Court found that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that he would commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.

The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

While the Court has great sympathy for the family and understanding of their plight in not being able to observe the trial for personal reasons, it has concluded that it must dismiss this application due to the serious concerns it has in granting the order being requested. 2) This application is both novel and unprecedented. Saskatchewan has developed protocol for accommodating the participants of a trial process including witnesses, lawyers and judges within the trial process by way of video conferencing. The Court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order allowing this type of communication for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province."
b_2004skqb101.txt,"The accused made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and s. 33(8) and s. 13(2) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry on a charge of murder. The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The Crown applied for a determination of preliminary issues including whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release on the basis that the accused was in the community awaiting trial and would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender's Act was dealt with by Madam Justice Pardu in R. v. M.R. [2001] O.J. No. 2598. She held that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction in the case of murder. The Youth Criminal Justice Act provides the following on interim judicial release where a young person elects to be tried by judge without jury, the judge shall be judge as defined in s. 552 of the Criminal Code, or if it is an offence set out in section 469 of the Code, the youth justice court judge will be judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction in that province in which the election is made."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court held that the Crown had not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Court concluded that to convict for mischief there must be an unlawful act and an objectively dangerous act."
b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants applied for judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents, The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Licensing Commission (SLGLC). The decision was with respect to a horse race that took place at Marquis Downs Race Track in Saskatoon. The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in the race. The horse which won was disqualified for interference at the gate. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision was quashed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices were given to the applicants. 1)The powers of the Commission in hearing appeals of the stewards' decisions are prescribed in s.17 of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The Commission has a duty to act fairly when it fails to give the applicants notice of the hearing and also to give them any opportunity to make representations to the tribunal. 2)The decision of the commission rests on an interpretation of s.32 L.C. which is not patently unreasonable. There exists a general right to procedural fairness and it is presumed in each case that procedural fairness applies and it will take an explicit or clearly implicit provision to the contrary in the legislation or the rules of horseracing, a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Here, as the Commission did not give adequate or implicit notice to the applicant applicants, it was without merit. 3)The opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions form no part of the record and therefore cannot be considered by the Court."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The 28 year old was convicted of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. He deposited a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. The next day, he withdrew $13,000. CIBC Visa lost the entire $24,000 in cash. The Provincial Court judge granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. The Crown appealed. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and a twelve month conditional sentence substituted in place of the conditional discharge. The accused had no criminal record and pre-sentence report suggested that he was low risk to re-offend. The conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in Mr. Roberts' situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity."

Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","This was an appeal of the decision of Judge Cacchione set aside and any order based thereon and the decision and recommendation of the Board set aside without costs to any party. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The interpretation of the Act, the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease are clear. The landlord may increase the rent during the term of the lease, for it places a restriction upon the common law right of the landlord: the increase must be only once every twelve months. 2)The Court found that the interpretation of s.11 of the Residential Tenancies Act and s. 11 of the Rent review Act was clear. 3)The provisions of the standard form did not provide for no rent increase. 4)The agreement by the respondent did provide for a three month notice."

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The defendants entered into a contract with the plaintiff whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants, ready to move home (""RTM""), placed on basement to be constructed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the RTM agreement was in error and sought rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. 1)There was no clear and convincing evidence that as of June 1992 the defendants knew or ought to have know that the price quoted did not include basement. It was in this context that then view the June 26 meeting. It may well be that in Mr. Skwerniuk's mind that in the course of that meeting he realized that $19,000 was included in the price of the basement. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and I am not satisfied that there was an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. 2)The plaintiff claims interest at the rate 15% or in the alternative pre-judgment interest. 3)The Court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events. It cannot accept that the plaintiff admits that he provided an approximate price on an RTM and basement. There was a mutual or common mistake in the written expression of the agreement and rectification may be made upon satisfying the Court that there is an actual concluded agreement. The real issue was the claim for rectification."
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument as follows: i) an interlocututory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the employees of Danka Canada Inc. in any position that involves the sale or lease of photocopiers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines and from performing any service work for customers of the company in respect of any machines that were sold or leased to the user by Danka. ii) the exclusion of the respondents from advertising their availability to the market or making known that they had joined the Danka team. iii) the submission by the applicant that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees is neither borne out by the facts nor the law."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of the Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The applicant is in essence a sole practitioner, who provided legal services to the applicant over 23 years period, beginning in 1992. The services were in relation to various matters of concern to the appellant. The applicant did not have a formal written retainer and the affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming satisfaction with the legal services provided at the rate charged. 2)The evidence put forward by the applicant does not support the allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty. 3)It is not in the interests of justice for the applicant to extend the time beyond the 30 day period provided by the Act which establishes an assessment as a matter of right."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his 11 year old stepdaughter. The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue, therefore, was the identity of the person who committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. The Crown also called a social worker trained in counselling. The social worker testified that she interviewed the complainant and others involved in the case and concluded that the child exhibited many of the symptoms often found in children who have been sexually abused, such as depression, attempts to block out recollection of events, low self-esteem, lack of trust in others and an inability to be specific as to details. Dismissing the appeal, that even though the complainant must have been mistaken as to the number of Friday nights she was sexually molested, such a misconception on her part, under all the circumstances of this case, does not destroy her credibility."

Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 5 months incarceration followed by 18 months probation with a probationary period and 18 months of supervised release.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The information disclosed in the pre-sentence report was not reliable nor properly before the court. 2)The appellant's stated belief that his son has not abused drugs or alcohol while residing with him was of marginal value given the offender's history of daily use. 3)The affidavit from the appellant was lacking in probative value. 4)The evidence disclosed by the respondent's father was not relevant to the disposition of this appeal."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement: 11. HELD: The parties did not cohabit for more than 90 days and there was no serious argument that they cohabited in 1997. The only issue was for how long. The respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitation extended from June 1997 until September 18. The petitioner's account was accepted but the respondent's was not accepted. In the final analysis, it comes to a question of credibility. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. They swore that they had cohabitated for ten days in May 1997, June 1997, September 1997 and June/July 1997 and then June/September 1998. The Respondent disputed the evidence of a period of 90 days. If the petitioner's testimony is accepted, the cohabitations would have extended for at least 95 days.  1) The respondent evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions.  2) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave forit were the same as in the divorce proceedings. There was no real argument that the two parties had been living together for 10 days in 1997 and from June/97 until June/98. The wife swore that the dates of the parties' 1997 marriage were ten days each and they lived together for 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose. The provisions contained in the Agreement will not be affected except as provided in this clause.  3) The Court reviewed the evidence in this matter. It was not necessary for the Court to review the evidence. The Court dealt with the issue of credibility in light of the narrow issue presented to it for determination."

The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors in relation to their claim in Queen’s Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C.Reg. Regina (the action) pending the petitioner’ s application or further court order. HELD: 1)The respondent argued that the restraining order granted under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted. 2)The criteria for the granting of preservation order are identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction.

The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The respondent brought an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 to strike out the applicant's Divorce Act application.

The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial. The Court believed that the test in Quaintance is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","This was an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board, dated September 17th, 2007.

His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information. The Department refused to provide further financial information and continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27th to September 7th as a period covered by the order. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. It found that the Board failed to properly exercise its judicial functions under the Act in making determination of whether the DeWolf's were 'persons in need' under the Social Assistance Act.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court. She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","The applicant asserts that the respondent's father's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to the applicant's company in contravention of an order of the Court making June 7, 1999 directing funds accruing to the respondent to be paid into court and freezing any money that was paid out. HELD: The application was adjourned to January 26, 2000. The court ordered the return of the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of exercise of access by the respondent in accordance with existing orders. The applicant sought an order against the third party, requiring it to pay $55k into court.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the plaintiff's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations to remain would be an abuse of process.

(e) it is otherwise an abusive of process of the Court; and (f) it may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly. There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. In the criminal proceedings the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in cross-examination. 3) The court reviewed the procedure to be followed on an application under Rule 173. It found that victim who is witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. Its exercise would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings is highly improbable and one which it is difficult to believe could be proved.

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing.

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in 1990 the appellant and her child were placed in the home of the respondent.

The trial judge misconstrued important evidence and misinterpreted important facts. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access. 1)The trial judge erred in deciding the best interests of the child when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the child's ability to care for the child, and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time in the mother's care. 2)The court reviewed the evidence and found the respondents had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which, as noted, the trial judge then had to decide the issue of custody."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They have three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief was dismissed without prejudice to the petitioner's right to claim child support. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. The fact that one is not the biological parent does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide maintenance for his or her child. 2)The circumstances of the'rent' that the applicant claims she pays are somewhat cloudy. After the separation, she moved back to the residence on Sinotte Crescent. She claims that she pays rent in the amount of $150.68 weekly (which amounts to $7,835.36 yearly). The credit card entry is double entry in that it is not an expense not already covered by the other expenses.

b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The deceased single mother was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries which resulted in her death. She was unemployed and had no income at the time of the accident. Her children were the sole beneficiaries of her dependant child care benefits which were payable under the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The father appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without any order as to costs. 1)Section 147 of the Act does not assist in determining whether any additional dependant care benefits are payable under s. 146(5). It merely provides that where there is no surviving spouse or where the deceased victim was, as is the case here, sole parent, the surviving spouse is entitled to an equal share of the death benefit pursuant to this subsection as long as that dependent child remains under 21 years of age; and 5% of the income replacement benefit is payable for each dependent child up to age 21 as an additional benefit. The total amount payable as death benefit is $94,854. 2)The father was the sole beneficiary of the children's child care benefit. SGI paid to the Public Trustee for the children the sum of $47,427. It was payable for the youngest child and the remaining children became entitled to the additional benefit in s.146(5) where, however, no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under this Act."

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.

The defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of the plaintiff for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The plaintiff and the defendants who have status in the proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of the company in this case were not entitled to the cost of the counsel appointed by Henry. The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. He was appointed for that purpose and is obliged in that capacity to instruct 609's counsel. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of this action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 2) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 pursuant to the normal right of re-examination by the Defendants. Whether the counsel is a lawyer appointed for the purpose or someone else from outside of that firm, is entirely subject to the Court's decision. Issues of disclosure, privilege and reporting as raised by the above noted questions are capable of resolution utilizing analogous proceedings without doing violence to fundamental principles in the litigation process. 3) The Court has not yet demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609 which is not having been demonstrated in the rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having be demonstrated that it warrant modification. The questions have their genesis in the pleadings which recite the plaintiff to be Henry, capacity which the defendants admit. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.  4) The action remains derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the plaintiffs against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.

d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005.

The affidavits contained incomplete and misleading information and, in any event, the learned justice of the peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search warrant.

The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by the Crown to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation, restitution of 1/2 of the overpayment and a fine of $32,866. Each gave half of the money to the paymaster. The judge accepted the joint recommendation for probation but ordered restitution in the full amount. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the remainder amount rather than one half as submitted in the Joint recommendation. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 1)The Crown concedes that the submissions made to the judge on sentence were the culmination of a plea negotiation process. While the agreement reached between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the joint report made to him was a fit sentence. 2)The Court accepts the joint recommendations for probation, probation in the case of Mr. Fraser, another employee who was part of the same scheme. The rationale for the recommendation of restitution was that the appellants had only retained for themselves 1/4 of the total amount of overpayment because, as noted, they had been required to give the other half back. The Court was advised that Trenton Works was content with this proposal and that the other one half would be sought in restitution order against the defendant who was to be before the courts shortly. 3)Leave to appeal was granted.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for term of two months. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September. The plaintiff alleges that the contract was also extended for further three months from September 30 until December 2005. The trial judge concluded that the respondent was deriving benefit from both his employer and from competitor. He also found that although the giving of unreasonable notice constituted a fundamental breach of the employment contract, the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal. The employment contract had not terminated until October 7, 1995. The claim against PCS is dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is awarded costs against Sullivan. 1)The trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2)The plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. 3)The court found no case law on point in this province and was unable to distinguish Sullivan's actions from those of Restauronics."

The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They now seek leave to appeal that decision.

However, the lack of availability of people connected with the Applicants' design work was not overly significant. The University's negligence claim would be resolved at trial on the basis of documents and expert testimony. 2) There was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave. 3) The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the applicants on appeal.

After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant. The accused blew a fail on the approved screening device and was taken to the RCMP detachment where samples of breath were obtained. HELD: The accused's rights to counsel were breached. 1)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 2)The accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. This was not a situation where the accused opted not to contact legal counsel and thus waived his rights under s.10(b). 3)The destroyed video evidence was of no relevance and could not be used to assist the accused."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in February 1988. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff had suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension and had delusions of paranoidal nature which made it difficult to obtain a clear picture of her subjective symptoms. Her injuries were substantially re-resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. She claimed that she had fallen twice and broken both hips, each of which resulted in surgery involving the implantation of plastic parts. The physical therapist testified that her present level of disability was 'in part' the result of the February 8, 1988 whiplash injury. She also claimed that her loss of housekeeping capacity was substantially compensated by the non-pecuniary damage award. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $18,000 as the proper level at the time of the accident was that of that of the plaintiff.  1)The plaintiff's pre-accident condition was mild and mild in nature. 2)If one adds her pre-existing conditions to the two post-accidents falls and subsequent hip replacements, it is not possible to conclude on the evidence that the part of her present condition brought about by the accident or in any way related thereto is of significance."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. Based on the respondent's income, the respondent had a gross annual income of $19,781.52. The Court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall, to order the respondent to pay additional amounts."
6_2004nspc30.txt,"The defendant was charged, as an employer, with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The accused was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act that, as an employer, he failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence charged. Although the accused was economically dependent on the defendant, was required to perform duties mainly for him and was in relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of independent contractor, the Crown took the position that both the defendant and the plaintiff were employers for the purposes of the Act, but as the plaintiff was not present on the day of the accident, only the defendant was charged. The Crown's argument that he was dependent on Harnish and Murphy jointly does not accord with the profit-sharing agreement. The fact that fishermen have traditionally seen themselves as being self-employed is an important factor in deciding this issue, but is not conclusive. Nor does the Crown argue that the defendant should be considered an employer although all four fishers were dependent on him for the licence."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. Over a period of time, the respondent paid out monies on account of fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance. The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) Neither party said anything about the value of the machinery. Rather, was referred to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two which were done by the respondent. Absent any evidence to the contrary, accept the valuation and find the property to be worth $43,000. 3) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 4) There are additional debts as follows which the petitioner has been looking after. Zellers 1,149.04 (2) CIBC loan 6,500.00 (3) Credit Union loan 4,989.30 Total 12,638"
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order. The appellant's wife, the respondent, has been living in the family home since February 2012 but had separated in March 2015. The respondent has made all of the payments required by the interim order, except for the spousals and exclusive possession. The applicant has filed garnishees to collect those arrear payments. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceeding is allowed. The court found that the principles pertaining to applications to lift a stay are well-settled. In making decisions with respect to such applications, the Courts objective is to prevent injustice and to ensure the results are as fair and equitable as possible for all sides, to minimize prejudice and to balance the competing interests. In this case, the appellant applied for stay of proceedings. The Court found that a stay should be imposed on the enforcement of the interim orders created by the January 2016 interim order and that the stay does not affect ongoing spousa support payments."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. The respondent was employed by Public Works Canada. His annual salary was $36,817. He worked considerable overtime in 1989 which brought his income up to $48,000. HELD: An award of interim maintenance was not made on the facts before the court as there was not time to present all the facts and there was a serious question as to whether her inability to earn money can be attributed to her being married. The court had the power to grant lump sum or periodic maintenance on an interim basis."
8_2002skqb144.txt,"FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The mortgagee opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The power of sale so conferred upon the courts, both of the Northwest Territories and of the province, was such that it gave to these courts the right, in foreclosure proceedings, to make an order for sale whenever the court deemed it necessary or expedient to do so, notwithstanding that an order nisi had been issued. Statutory authority for a judicial sale in mortgage foreclosure proceedings was contained in the Chancery Procedure Amendment Act, 1852 (Imp.) 15 16 Vict., c. 86. That Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by the Judicature Ordinance, 1893. In its modified form it is now found in s. 70 of The Queen's Bench Act, S.S. 1998, c. Q-1.01. Border Credit Union was entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure.

The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","At the conclusion of the hearing of this application, the Court granted the applicant's application for an interim injunction until trial, or until further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. The Court held that it had established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that the applicant might have. The applicant had shown more than the mere prospect or apprehension of injury; it had shown that the defendants were indoing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of itsrights and that the plaintiff is suffering in consequencethereof and that such suffering cannot be adequatelycompensated for by the award of damages in money.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The Court granted the appeal. 1) The Court held that the definition in the Act did not apply to personal property under the provisions of the Act. 2) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence and the Crown put street value on the drugs at slightly under $2000 and the respondent valued the drugs slightly less than $2000. 3) The truck had value of approximately $20,000 and the sentencing judge was required pursuant to s16 to order the property be forfeited because the section mandates the same, subject to s18 to 19.1, by the use of the words'shall' order that the truck be seized. 4) In relation to dwelling house, the Court may take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence (s19.1(4)). 5) There is no reference to proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property. 6) The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that the workplace stressors experienced by the respondent worker were not unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case, which was reviewed for correctness. The issue was whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if so, whether it applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA) and sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain legal principles that must be met. The first requirement is that the stressors must be excessively and unusually stressful, objectively viewed and, in the actual case of the individual worker, give rise to the mental or physical condition on which the claim is based. The second requirement is the exclusion of work related events such as 'routine employment related actions' and 'labour relations issues'. WCAT did not err in failing to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to the contrary to rebut that opinion. The third requirement is an objective assessment of the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. This is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GECA and furthers its overall intent to provide no fault compensation for injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The question of whether the policy is more restrictive than the general law that applies to GECA is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The Court found that WCAT erred in finding that there were 'unusual or excessive' stressors in the workplace which could ground a claim for gradual onset stress. It found that they were not. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors, there was no causal link between those stressors and his stress injury."

Both she and the child were completely dependent upon the public purse.

Such an obligation would leave him with $2,010 per month after he had paid his income tax, Canada Pension Plan and Unemployment Insurance contributions.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Under the terms of the arrangement between the insurance companies, coverage was put in place on the basis of notice from the mortgage company. The insured property was totally destroyed by fire some 22 hours before the deadline. The mortgage was in both names and the insured insured did not know of the fire loss. The insurance policy was placed with the Co-operators General Insurance Company and protected both the insured's interests and the interests of the Mortgagee. The insurer of the insured property, which was owned by the insured, had advised the insured of the cancellation of the policy and had advised her of the possibility of foreclosure and that other insurance had been placed in place. When the insured applied to foreclose, the insurance company refused to cover the insured and the insurer refused to pay the insured. In this action, the insured claimed that the insurance policy had been cancelled and that the insured had been negligent in failing to notify the insurer of all the risks which came to their knowledge, specifically, the fact that the mortgage payments were in arrears and the financial and other difficulties of the Browns, that she was desperately attempting to sell this property, and that she had been threatened with foreclosure"" (Beckett letter, Feb. 24, 1993, TAB 49). The insured, who had been the insured for the mortgage at the time of the loss, claimed that there had been an overlap to the extent of one day of coverage that being the date of loss. HELD: The claim was dismissed.  1)The insured insured was not affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the mortgaged person. The reasonable expectation of the mortgagee was that the clause would have the same effect as a separate policy insuring the insured interest as the policy. 2)The insurance company was not obliged to provide coverage to the insured on the first day of the claim. 3)The insurer was not under any obligation to tell the insured that the coverage would take effect immediately."

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood. The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat. He also testified that he did not intend to drive the vehicle. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. 1)The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation or conjecture to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The court allowed the appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations and in particular, that she was an alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care, there should have been an order directing trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed."

No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment. The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase. There was no-cross appeal by the owner. The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value. Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double column V to the respondent. The Committee was correct in concluding the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order. It was asked to affirm what was in essence a nullity.","Land owner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the Board of Revision of the City of Regina alleging it was too high. No cross-appeal was filed by the City, but the Board increased the assessment. The City appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase. The Board did not raise the vires issue so as permit the City to make argument on it, its conclusion was correct.

8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of voir dire evidence, the accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The issue was whether the accused was able to establish on balance of probabilities that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) had been breached, such that the Court should order an exclusion of evidence in accord with s. 24 of the Charter. Related to that issue, the Court must determine whether the Crown met any onus on it to establish that the accused had waived his rights. At no point was there evidence that there was a waiver of the right to reasonable opportunity."
e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss253(b) and driving while disqualified contrary so s259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 3 in the Information. 1)The Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the accident occurred and at all material times. The impugned conduct affects only the weight to be given to the evidence of the witnesses notwithstanding the conduct complained of. The right of the accused to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence in these circumstances. 2)The conversation complained of was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before it. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did they find tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. The accused's testimony was most apparent to me because of his insistence that there were only two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving. The driver of the Sunfire was unsteady on his feet and leaned on vehicle to support himself. He had alcohol on his breath and his eyes were bloodshot. The cab driver's testimony that he saw the accused get out of his truck and fall asleep enroute to his destination was questionable. The police were operating under very tight time lines in order to meet the requirements permitting reliance on the presumption. 3)The Court was unable to conclude that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident. The Court found that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugning behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. In these circumstances, the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. In any event, the Court found the accused guilty of counts 3 and 3."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","Pricewaterhouse retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors of Alternative Sports Limited pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. When the Trustee attended at the premises, he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. The Trustee refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. HELD: The defendant was entitled to summary judgment including a declaration with respect to the inventory, with detailed inventory and results of the liquidation to be filed with the court.  1)There was no meaningful difference between an 'arguable' issue and 'bona fide' issue. There were no facts advanced of agreement as to the term of the proposed lease. 2)The Trustee was never instructed to prepare lease forms."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate and proper period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment with the defendant plus vacation pay of 6 percent per annum. The Court also found that the plaintiff had no notice of the proposed changes until the letter of June 1997, which put in process events which led to the constructive dismissal as of July 14th. 1997., She was, therefore, wrongfully dismissed as of that date."

The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 when the mother was working in bar. The father had been in the military for a year, was honourably discharged and had several years employment as a security guard. He was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm and driving over.08. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the parties met their obligations under the agreement reached at pre-trial, the father had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and had been overpaid. 2) The court found that the father was not entitled to the child tax credit and child support paid by the father and the other parties were his only sources of income. 3) The parties had an agreement to allow the father to stay in the home with the children for the duration of the child's stay. 4) The father was employed full time and received $300 per month from the mother. 5) The mother was unable to explain how he came to be indebted to Revenue Canada. She blames his incomplete financial disclosure on not knowing how to complete a financial statement despite having done one previously. It is a beneficial arrangement for him financially."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the respondent had failed in his onus to show why the imputed income was still appropriate. It was also found that he had avoided providing meaningful financial support to his children and that his mental health problems prevented him from working. The Court did not find that the petitioner's failure to assist with post-secondary expenses was a contributing factor to the delay in paying child support."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him.

The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.

Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. The accused argued that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, through her counsel, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At the conclusion of the trial, defence counsel notified defence counsel of the new evidence and disclosure was provided to defence counsel within twenty-four hours of the Crown learning of it. The Crown argued strenuously that the information which it has now recently disclosed was already in the possession of the accused because she participated in the discussions with Corporal Vail. HELD: A mistrial was ordered. 1)The accused gave up her right to contest the admissibility of the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence and to remain silent. 2)The Court was satisfied that the accused had not been prejudiced by the disclosure of evidence. 3)The trial was fair from the perspective of the public and society more broadly. The trial would be fair from a point of view of fairness and balance of probabilities. 4)There was no dispute between the parties on the general obligations of disclosure imposed on the Crown beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Stinchcombe, [1991] S.C.R. 326, which has been followed and elaborated on ever since it was decided in 1991. The court is always reluctant to order a mistrial except in the clearest of cases and when the impugned conduct undermines trial fairness or the decision making process. In this case, the accused took positive steps to place her knowledge and intent at issue. She agreed to have her video taped statement go in without contest. During that video, she raised the issue of willful blindness which was critical in this case. The “truth seeking” function of the court would be compromised if I were to grant an order excluding evidence which the parties clearly recognize as important."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.

It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below.

The appellant contended the issue is not academic in nature but is a matter of disciplinary proceedings and the court has the power to review the matter. As it is disciplinary in nature and can ultimately result in his dismissal, he argues he is entitled to procedural fairness including full hearing, the right to a fair hearing and the disciplinary penalty is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs accepted the terms offered by the defendant and acted on them. 2) The letter from the defendant did not contain the terms of the offer the defendant received from the financial institution, but simply advised of the price. 3) The loan approval issued by Farm Credit Corporation is not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment to finance the purchase of the farm land. 4) The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. 5) The defendants counterclaim is dismissed. 6) Costs of the action. 7) The plaintiff's remarks were made with respect to the statement of claim as being false, frivolous and vexatious and he did not have the benefit of full argument on the point."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death could found a conviction; (2) instructing the jury they could return a first degree murder conviction on the basis of s.231(5) of the Criminal Code; and (3) failing to give adequate instructions on the defence of drunkenness. The court also found errors in the jury selection process.","This was an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder. The trial judge's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors, the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder. HELD: Appeal allowed, verdict set aside and a new trial ordered on the indictment. 1)On the evidence adduced at trial, the jury should not have been instructed that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death can found a conviction for murder by the application of s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code. 2)The instructions on the defence of drunkenness were not adequate and there were errors in the jury selection process.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There was a marriage breakdown and the divorce was granted. The parties' claim under the Matrimonial Property Act and for Corollary Relief under the Divorce Act was resolved by agreement prior to trial except for 1) how the children's investments should be administered; 2) custodial alternatives'sole or joint custody'; 3) specific access; 4) quantum of child maintenance. The specifics of this case lead me to believe that the parties, who have functioned under joint custody for eight and half months, need more than the tool or the guide that is being suggested by the respondent. The children's investment in Canada Savings Bonds and Mutual Funds exist in the childrens' names in the approximate amount of $2,000 each. They are happy and content to be with their father. The day to day physical custody, and decision making during this period are their greatest concerns. To date, it has not been the 'occasional resort' to the Court referred to in Krugger v. Krugger (1980), 11 R.F.L. (2d) 52. It is impossible to determine the source or the reason why the symptoms or responses of the children are occurring. It could be any single or combination of factors that have occurred since June 30, 1993."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff suffered a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence. He slipped and his right calf became impaled on a picket fence. The medical records showed that the plaintiff had been impaled for approximately 25 minutes and that the injury was through and through a wound. The doctor testified that he did not see any foreign bodies in the wound at the time of the impalement but that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury suffered. The plaintiff's case, therefore, is dismissed with costs."
2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $4,007.83. 1)Cost of Performance was to be valued on the basis of cost of performance (of bringing the system up to the standard originally intended) and not in the diminution in value of the building. 2)The appraiser was aware of the deficiencies. 3)The plaintiff was not required to pay for the balance of the extras because the defendant had failed to provide invoices to substantiate the cost of repairs."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law in its totality and all of the factors, nor did the trial judge err by drawing an inference that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle during time frame No. 2 was impaired by alcohol. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same."

HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,"The appellant appeals from an order directing that the daughter of the parties attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the seven week period before the trial is fixed for February 21, 2005. Counsel for both parties acknowledged in argument that joint custody with an equal sharing of time should continue pending trial. As such, there is no need to vary the interim order. The real issue is where the child will attend kindergarten. As indicated above, this matter will be proceeding to trial within the next three to four months. Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. Commencing in January 2005, the child shall attend kindergarten at Saskatoon. The respondent's move to Saskatoon will impact the terms of the final order with regard to the parenting issue.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The sole beneficiary of the estate was the elder son. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust until the child attains the age of twenty-one years. Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on solicitor-client basis out of the Estate. HELD: The maintenance was to be deferred for one year until he attains age twenty one years. The mother's income, including survivor's benefits and family allowance payments should be taken into account as she had an obligation to make some contribution to the maintenance of the children. The father's estate assets valued at approximately $220,000 were currently in liquid form. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. Application for leave to apply to this court from time to time for further direction or clarification as may be required. A more generous award may result. The deceased himself provided in the will that the Executors had absolute and uncontrolled discretion to encroach on capital for the purposes of child maintenance, education, benefit and advancement. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and, whereas in Thauberger (supra) the interest income exceeded the level of support claimed, here it is unknown what income the Estate will generate. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondents following trial in Provincial Court on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact fishing commercially and that the fishing Regulations in question infringed their aboriginal right to fish. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 based on the standard defence. He found he would have convicted the accused on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had established."
d_2010skqb458.txt,"Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439. The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The court held that the offer was considerably more favourable to the petitioner than what the respondent offered to settle for. The court found that the purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. Nor was this a new or novel proceeding under the court's rules of court."
1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","This was an application by the respondent for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The respondent had been advised to stay out of the investment business for an indefinite period of time until he recovered to cope with daily stresses of the business. The applicant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by way of an injunction. HELD: The application for interim injunction was granted without costs. 1)Although the hearing before the tribunal might result in the charges being either substantiated or rejected, the Court was unable to instruct his counsel and his counsel stated at the hearing that if the injunction was not granted, no submissions would be made by the applicant to the disciplinary panel with respect to penalties. 2)The applicant would have satisfied the requirements of the interim injunction except in very special circumstances, e.g. where there was a denial of natural justice illustrated by several examples of unfair procedures and unfair procedures."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence seized was admissible against the accused. The Crown had relied on circumstantial evidence but had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the items seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use. It was obvious that he had control of the bag and contents until he left the motor vehicle."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one Sandra Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to her. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The appellant's application to adduce fresh evidence was dismissed with written reasons to follow.  1)The evidence of the complainant was not new. The Crown had proven each and every essential ingredient of the charge to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore found the appellant guilty as charged on that count. 2)The Court accepted the complainant's testimony that she bought drugs from the appellant and that she was the owner of the methamphetamine in the basement of her home. However, the Court did not accept the trial judge's evidence that the appellant was the dealer and that the methamphetamine was found virtually in plain view. 3)The trial judge rejected the appellant's evidence of selling methamphetamine."

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","HELD: The Court found that the children were in need of protective services and that the mother, who was the principle caregiver, was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining them. The children had been out of their mother's care for approximately one-half of their lifetime. The mother was to cooperate with the completion of a Psychological and Parental Capacity Assessment and that general costing clause was included in the interim costs. The Court ordered the mother to move into an apartment with access to both the father and the mother. The father was to provide counselling to the mother and support for the mother's emotional and physical health."

Releasing the appellant pending sentence, that his detention was not necessary in the public interest. When the grounds of appeal do have some merit, the test for release should not be more strenuous at the early stage of the proceeding",The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault against his teenaged nieces. The Crown opposed the application for bail pending appeal. The appellant had the onus of satisfying the three conditions of s. 679(3). The grounds of appeal were not frivolous nor did it seem that there was much risk that he would not appear in court when ordered. He abided by the terms of the pre-trial release and had strong economic and family ties to his community.

The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT.

By an agreement dated November 17, 1997, the parties agreed that the Husband should have interim sole custody and the Wife would have access to the child. The respondent resisted the applicant's request for overnight access on the basis that his emotional health made it difficult for the applicant to cope with the child over extended periods of time.

The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The parties were married for nine years and had one child, born January 6, 1989. They separated in 1996 after 12 years of marriage. The respondent was 46 and 42 years of age. He was employed as a nurse in Nova Scotia. Throughout the marriage, the mother had suffered from serious mental illness and had refused two postings outside the province. The applicant retired from the military in July 2004 after 25 years of service. He received a severance package and pension was to start in September 2005.

The mother was to receive a lump sum payment of $400.00 per month until August 2008. The court found that there had been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before variation could be considered. Although the applicant's income had increased to some extent, in all other respects her circumstances were the same as they were at the time of the granting of the divorce. Although he had some employment since retirement, his income was reduced. Although there is no cure for Ms. Fraser's illness, it is manageable. She has home and could take in boarders. She will require more money to survive. She should not have to turn to the state unless absolutely necessary."

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification of an action under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who served in the Canadian Armed Forces but was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either under the Indian Act or any other relevant Act or Statute in force under the Canada Pension Plan or by predecessor legislation to the same effect and therefore cannot constitute a cause of action. (b) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to the class members. (c) There is no bar to the bringing of these motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. The Court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. The Crown appeals her decision and argues that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The Youth Court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s.102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the respondent in custody."

This judgment deals with the divorce of a young couple who resided in the family home on the SE¼-27‑52-05-W3rd in the Province of Saskatchewan. The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, there was no evidence as to how the value arrived at other than an inspection of the property. HELD: 1) The Court ordered the sale and distribution of proceeds from something less than the entirety of the family property as of the date of application and found the value to be $95,100.  2) There was nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the adjudication was to be preferred over the time of application. 3) The evidence was accepted as to the value of the home. The appraisal was in format and follows procedure long recognized by the Court. The letter was simply that, letter from a real estate agent.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

The child was to provide Jodi-Lin and Denby with at least thirty days notice of which days he will be exercising his rights of access.

Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This action was brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. The principal officer of Fossil incorporated it for the purpose of becoming involved with Tudex. The three principal officers of Tudex heard evidence from Lovell, Crooks and Molle. The third principal officer was not called. The claim for $31,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescission of the agreement relating to the market study was disallowed. In its counterclaim, Fossil alleges that Tudex is seeking to contradict or vary the terms of the contract outlined in the letter of June 2, 1981. That is not so. There is no ambiguity. Lovell was hired as a fund development officer. The question is what was intended by that designation. In the counterclaim Tudex seeks rescission, not only of the contracts of June 1981 but also of the agreements relating to a market study and the agreement regarding the market. There was a misunderstanding. The letter of September 18 effectively did that. When there was a failure of performance by a Fossil in an essential part of a contract, the defendant was entitled to repudiate it. An order for rescission is not necessary. And Tudex, having accepted the performance by the Fossil on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor, there is no basis for a rescission.

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. The respondent has instructed the petitioner to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. HELD: 1) Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish a concluded agreement, am hard pressed to come up with a situation where the existence of a settlement proposal would be relevant to an issue before the Court. The law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could be used to their detriment. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should undoubtedly err on the side of protecting the privilege. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. The letter was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My proposal is reasonable so must be good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore not as good parent.' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote."

Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties were married in 1990 in Lebanon and had three children, aged 12, 11, 11 and 9. The parties separated in 1991.

8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings.  1)The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. The Crown argued that stress and frustration are irrelevant and are part of the usual effects of being subject to a criminal charge. The accused argues that she was reluctant to make further applications to amend her release conditions given the amendments she had already obtained to her release. 2)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007. As indicated in Morin, prejudice can be inferred from prolonged delay.  3)Evidence was led by the accused that she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress, frustration and stress. She further alleges that the passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion. The plaintiff denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs. The present s. 27 (1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes, the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt, who was in bankruptcy for 28 months, alleged that the business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. The cause of bankruptcy as set out in the S. 170(1) report was failure of his former business, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. The bankrupt contended that the failure was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. HELD: The bankrupt was ordered to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee. 1)Section 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibits the disclosure of information relating to the history of payments of goods and services tax. 2)Section 241 of the Act does not permit disclosure of personal information. 3)The bankrupt was in his early fifties and in good health. He has not worked since 1992 and has voluntarily chosen to have nothing to do with the business his common law wife now operates. Counsel for Revenue Canada contends that disclosure is in accordance with the principle in Slattery as this information is necessary to show the conduct and attitude toward creditors before and after bankruptcy. 4)Section 172(5)of the Act requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge.  5)The bankruptcy is a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires affidavit evidence to be basedupon personal knowledge in order to deal with the allegations on an individual basis. Based upon the evidence and submissions, Revenue Canada has not been satisfied that any of these facts have been proved."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act relating to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant's responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arose under s. 13(1) of the Act. The Act also requires that every employee, while at work, shall 'take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to protect the employee's own health and safety at or near the workplace'. The defendant failed to secure the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. Nothing can bring Mr. Boake back to life but the experience of the tragedy and, very importantly, Mr. Sutherland's knowledge of addressing farm safety issues, can assist in preventing another life."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. In the end, the Court imputed an income level to the respondent that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). Costs of $3,000 were assessed against the respondent. The court assigned an additional one day of Court time to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the parenting issue, the evidence established that the applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. The respondent's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed by the Court. Mr. Williams did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation."

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment to hear an application for leave to commence an action pursuant to the Land Contracts (Actions) Act. HELD: The application for an order nisi for sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received. Counsel invites the court to apply Rule 5(1) with respect to the irregularities identified. An application was made for a judicial sale in the amount of $35,000. The only evidence of the value of the property at this stage is contained in paragraph 10 of the affidavit, sworn on June 10, 2008 in part as follows: That the land is in my opinion of $30,000 to $45,000 and no more. The Credit Union understands that it is listed at $70,000 but the Credit Union's position is that this is overvalued and would likely sell in the $30k to $ 45,000 range. This opinion is based on discussions with the real estate company, Royal LePage Community Realty of Maple Creek, who has knowledge of property being sold in the area. The draft bill of costs submitted by counsel contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.",The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the following: Playa Costa Verda; Club Covarrubias; Grand Playa Pesquero; and Hotel Sol Rio de Luna Mares. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act did not restrict the ability of the plaintiff to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. The Court found that if the plaintiff could not find viable plaintiffs in time for the certification hearing and rule that the Ragoonanan motion succeeded then that would fatal to a large number of unsuspecting plaintiffs. 1) The Court held that it was not necessary for the Court to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification. 2) It was not in the Court's view that the usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. 3) The court was not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. 4) The plaintiff was not seeking through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor to have the court direct Inco to change any portion of the material.
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. The respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousa maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal Support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was “disabled and still receiving treatments”, that her was enrolled in legal assistant program, and that she had sought permanent full time employment since losing the Westfair foods position, but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate that she could not work and did not, in fact, say she was unable to work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking a full time position. 2) The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $13,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage. He found the respondent's income to be $38,964.37. The evidence did not begin to establish that the proper income for the respondent (who was 60) was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 and the couples' daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time.

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board applied for a declaration that the Province of Nova Scotia is responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of the province and where it is necessary to lease school buildings, the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no provision in either the Education Act or the Regulations under the Act that require the Minister to pay or reimburse the Board for leasing expenses. The Minister is under no obligation to reimburse board for the cost of these leases. 2)The payment of leasing expenses by the Province is not unprecedented. From 1978 to 1982, the North Side-Victoria Amalgamated School Board leased parish schools with the leasing costs being fully paid by the province.

7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amountof unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters and to reduce arrears of approximately $14,600. HELD: The application for variation was dismissed and the respondent was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are less than $2,200. The father had worked sporadically since 1989 and had increased expenses correspondingly. He had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance benefits. He proposed that his support obligation be eliminated or at least reduced during his months of unemployment. Counsel did not suggest that the obligation be reduced by one-half. Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been amaterial change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that the court reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs was taken out. The court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor and clients costs claimed by the applicant. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be considered judicially on the facts of the case."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. The question of the division of certain matrimonial assets has been contentious one and the fact that there is property in Germany and India as well as in Saskatchewan has complicated matters. The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

At the time his driver's license was revoked. At trial the defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the highway. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving motor vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. HELD: The accused was found not convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended and the charge under s.287(2 was dismissed. The defence argued the words “motor” in s 287(3) do include an electric vehicle and that the accused could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle, or for speeding, or a motor offence since he was never licensed to operate an AT vehicle on the road. The offence was committed while his ATV was registered. The words 'truck' and “across highway” do not appear to include either a vehicle prohibited from operation upon the highway by s. 11. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV because it was a prohibited vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get a license. Under the Motor Vehicle Act an individual driving vehicle upon highway must be properly licensed. It is argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the motor vehicle and the revocation of his driver’s license he should be guilty of this offence. The Defence argues that it is not that simple. The use of motor vehicles on public highways by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be convicted of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type and class for which they could properly have been permitted to drive it on a highway. In s.285(2), the words ""motor Vehicle"" include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a license in the city. While note that section 12 of the Off-Highway Vehicles Act permits the operation of an ATVs prohibited from the highway, these provisions are not relevant to this case."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. He was acquitted of all other charges. The complainant testified that she was driving down the road when she noticed that the accused was following her. She described her husband as being aggressive, smelling of alcohol and agitated. She was unable to exit because he stopped beside her. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge correctly identified the law in Saskatchewan in relation to this principle and the trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct, or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently, but whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the decision. 1)The trial judge's decision focussed primarily on the fact the accused overtook the complainant and 'pushed' her to the side of the road. The lack of care must be serious enough to merit punishment. 2)The accused's driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances. The offence will only be made out if the accused intentionally applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant, the complainant did not consent to the force applied, and she was forced off the road to avoid collision. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and re-examined the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that the judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the fact that the manner in which the appellant drove was inherently dangerous. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the Court's decision."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. Although the family has an English speaking background, the children attended École de Bellegarde, a French language school located approximately 35 km from Maryfield. Their attendance at the school was made possible by provisional permission granted to them by the school administration. In February 2013, the school informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children applied to strike out the statement of claim. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons.  1)Not all Canadian citizens have the right to have their children educated in French. Sections 23(1) and (2) of the Charter state that 23.(1) Citizens of Canada (a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or (b) who reside in the United States, to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransaskois schools in Saskatchewan.  2) Not all Canadians have a right to an education in French, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  3) The lawless children's claim should be struck under Rule 7-9-2(e) of The Queen's Bench Rules as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF, and they consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF'."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer after applying for and failing to receive final subdivision approval applied for and received a tentative subdivision approval in 1997. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The applicant applied for final approval in 1998 and received the same in 1998. The next day, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to comply with the new road standards and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Applicant took issue with the development officers decision to declare the application incomplete and looked to this Court for relief. HELD: The applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan). The requirements for mandamus are exacting. Justice Rogers in Rawdon Realties Limited et al v. Rent Review Commission considered the prerequisites for certiorari application. He found that s. 283 represents the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamated company which included Sweeney. The parties entered into a so-called Letter Arrangement whereby the defendant would conduct detailed energy performance evaluations of the plaintiff's operations and make recommendations for improvements and reductions in costs. The plaintiff paid the defendant what it called a deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff Fifty Percent of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendants' recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The default judgment was set aside as being premature, as it was obtained before the time limit for making an appearance had expired. The defendant did not want strings attached to it securing setting aside of the default judgment. It did not relish giving up its present leverage in a way that would allow the defendant to pursue the litigation in Ontario at considerable cost and inconvenience to the plaintiff, who is without any presence there. The defendants had not brought itself within the scope of the remarks of Chief Justice Cowan in Pinard and Pinard v. Bushell et al. (1975), 20 N.S.R. (2d) 317 at p.375. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff's mistake was not one of substance rendering its claim for relief nullity. It had the right to default. It attempted to exercise it. It merely erred in choosing the Prothonotary as being the appropriate forum. 2)Although technically, the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default under Civil Procedure Rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant. It is difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced as it had already made it clear that it was not going to file a defence in Nova Scotia. 3)The defendant's apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court was not a mistake or an oversight. This was not an omission through inadvertence or insufficient time or other pressing business. It was a deliberate decision to ignore the proceedings in British Columbia. 4)There was no wilful or excessive delay on the defendant's part in moving to set aside the default."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The petitioner claimed an interest in the farming operation which included the respondent's father and mother as well as three brothers of the respondent. The respondent attempted to introduce such evidence through an expert in contravention of the Rules of Court. HELD: The respondent's income was fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the petitioner's adjusted income was $25,721.07. The court ordered that all or part of the capital cost allowance be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the parties to obtain the total payable for the three children. 1) The petitioner was employed and the respondent was unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) he will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The court found that the petitioner was in loco parentis in respect of the farm equipment and that the respondent received the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of the child. The Court found that although the petitioner had only completed seeding on one-third of the land, she was in possession of the other half of it. 3) The Court concluded that the facts justify adding back 25% of the average capital cost on land and buildings, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. 4) The evidence with respect to the remaining issues leaves much to be desired. There is no evidence as to the tax implications regarding matrimonial property. It involves farming expenses which reflect the decreased value of the equipment over time. There are no costs awarded to either party and each must pay their own costs."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: The Government was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of the parties involved was a serious breach of trust and a breach of fiduciary duty. The pleadings did not meet the requirements of Rule 173 of the Rules. The Government relied on R.E.L. v. J.G. (Canada), where the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation' were struck. However, as the Defendant was in charge of the Residential School at the time, the legislation governs its operation and maintenance. This arrangement is within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and, as such, the Plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars."
