d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two young complainants were living with their mother. He denied assaulting the complainants, but was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for the assault on the 14-year-old when she was between 14 and 17 and on the second count of being 1 month consecutive. The complainants had made a complaint to the appellant, who was employed full-time and was not a user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with them. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence, which resulted in a substantial breach of the complainant's evidence. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that in assessing the evidence the trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony, and found no error. He sentenced the appellant to nine months in prison followed by 2 years probation. The sentence on the first count was 1 month straight. The appeal was dismissed. There were five grounds of appeal: 1)Criminal Code applies and may require editing of the judgment or heading before publication. In this case the appellant was found guilty of both counts. 2)The Court was unable to say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal to be allowed, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other obstructing the workers conducting the harvest operation, so that the harvesting work had to be stopped. The plaintiff applied to terminate the attachment order on the basis that it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, as there were no grounds for the order, or there were other good reasons for termination. The applicant argued the court should consider the extent to which the plaintiffs' businesses had been disrupted by the action brought by the defendant, the fact that the plaintiff had not made sufficient efforts to bring the claim to final determination, and the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in rule 49.01(1).HELD: 1) The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. 2) The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The defendant had not established any principled basis to justify the maintenance of the order.  3) It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to delay the execution of the action."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at 2:40 and 3:01. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are five alterations of the preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks on the document. Each of these changes consists of changing the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not possible to know who made the striking out of the word and symbol 'BreathalyzerÂ®' and the writing in of the 'Intoxilizer' and there is no symbol with it. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure that this was done. 2)The accused's argument that she did not adequately designate the model of the approved instrument was not supported by the evidence. 3)There was no evidence that the accused blew into any of the instruments designated for the purposes of identification, nor that there was any evidence that she was qualified to make this argument. There was no medical evidence as to the alcohol level at the time of the samples taken, no reference at all to the name of the instrument, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose, section 237(6) of the Criminal Code. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The Court noted that R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.) was specifically not followed in Saskatchewan. It was unnecessary and inappropriate for the Court to comment upon those issues."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondentâs Line 150 income for child support purposes was $112,871. There was nothing in the evidence before the court that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis.  2) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without impeding the ongoing operation of the company. The corporate cash flow statement showed very little cash available for distribution. 3) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be costs in the cause."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner. The reasons for withholding consent by landlord are neither arbitrary or unreasonable; in so failing to consider the Landlord's reasons, the Court believes the Residential Tenancies Officer erred in law."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002. He argued that his income had decreased as a result of his being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year, and that his wife had terminated her obligation to contribute to their son's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband's layoff was only temporary and had not resulted in a change in circumstance as required by s. 14 of the Guidelines. The unreasonableness of the wife's position warrants an assessment of costs. 2) The wife was entitled to her costs of the child support application in the amount of $54 per month for the support of their son. 3) The child ceased to be a child of the marriage in March 2003 based on the circumstances as set out in Zaba, Farden and MacDonald. 4) The father's income had increased since the May 2002 order. It was clear that the husband was currently unemployed, he had 'vague knowledge' of when he would be rehired. The employer had at all relevant times been Pow City Mechanical. The child had been in full-time attendance at a post-secondary institution. If any of these circumstances were established, it would result in a variation of the support order."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue of the sale and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof have been decided by the Court. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply an adjustment to the owner's property. There is no doubt in the present case the first prerequisite is law. The questions as have recast them are clearly questions of law. For a question to be sufficiently meritorious to place before the Court either the judge hearing the application for leave must have a doubt, if not serious doubt, about whether the tribunal appealed from correctly decided the question or the question must be of such broad importance that it deserves the attention of and determination by a higher authority irrespective of whether the judge has any doubt about the correctness of the tribunal's resolution."
b_1995canlii3936.txt,"The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property. A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender, who had been raised by his maternal aunt following the early death of his parents, escaped custody and took a truck from the parking lot of a residence. A police officer saw them in the stolen vehicle and, after speeding, including turning corners at high speeds, they struck the side of an attached garage. HELD: The disposition of five months was set aside and 1 year secure custody, again concurrent to the 9 month open custody sentence, substituted. 1)The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on B.D.L., a young offender following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. The four offences were: escaping lawful custody, contrary to s. 145(1)(a); (i) stealing property valued at more than $1,000; (ii) dangerous driving contrary to ss. 249(1(a); and s. 355(a). 2)The accused had turned 18 in October 1994. He had been involved in a series of offences since the first set of charges. The accused had been in breach of probation. He turned 18 on October 13, 1994. In October 1994, another police officer found the accused in another stolen vehicle the steering column of which had been dismantled. On October 11, 1994, a police chase began. The youth offender and the other young offender fled on foot when the truck they were driving hit the garage. Another police officer located the accused when they were fleeing on foot. They were later apprehended and a 5 month secure custody disposition, concurrent to an existing disposition, was ordered."
9_1996canlii5086.txt,"The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. After being pulled back into the store by the clerk an altercation occurred between the clerk and the appellant. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal is allowed and a sentence of 1 year incarceration is imposed along with a 10 year section 100 Order. 1)The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as 'technically a robbery' and the appeal against conviction was therefore dismissed. 2)It was appropriate to allow the appeal and to reduce the sentence to one year incarceration with a tenyear s.100 order."
c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.",The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance from the respondent husband. The parties owned three separate properties at the time of the separation. One of the properties was purchased with proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property but broke down en route and was abandoned because the cost of repairs would have exceeded the value of the vehicle. The respondent husband cross-appealed claiming that the property was given to him by his sister and he overstated the purchase price of the property. The trial judge found this to be a palpable and overriding error and dismissed the appeal and the cross application without costs. Both parties' affidavits were found to be true. The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review as the evidence was readily available at trial and there would not be the same opportunity for direct and cross-examination related to the evidence which was available for the trial.
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The Court dismissed both applications for an order varying the child support order granted by the Justice R.D. Maher by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The Court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child and that, given that the oldest child had expressed a desire to live with her mother, it was not change."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicantâs proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for seeding 1,050 acres. The defendant refused to allow the plaintiff's lawyer to refer to exhibit P-5 of the contract, arguing that it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the plaintiff. The court reviewed the relevant part of the transcript. The trial judge did no more than attempt to keep the trial moving forward and to require the defendant to answer the question that he had been asked at that point multiple times. 2)The trial judge made no error in weighing the central issue of law with respect to the issues of law. The fact that water washes might have changed seeding patterns or made seeding more difficult did not entitle the plaintiff to refuse to mitigate its losses."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike two affidavits filed by the applicant regarding the applicant's failure to attend a hearing before the Council regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The applicant sought to have the affidavits struck as they raised a jurisdictional issue, which was not raised as an issue in the original application. In the context of the Council and other commodity boards, the issues raised were the relevance and general propriety of the drafting of the material and evidentiary issues of the nature raised in Waverley and Montagu v. Nova Scotia (1993), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 46 (SC). Dismissing the application, that there must in fact be a real dispute between the parties and affidavits are admissible, but they are not admissible on an application for certiorari. When it is granted on the ground of want of jurisdiction, or bias, or fraud, affidavit evidence is only admissible if the record does not provide enough information about the issues in dispute. Similarly with the application involving the interpretation of the law (Statutes and Regulations), affidavits were always admissible to show the record was incomplete, as for instance, that a conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses. The merits of the case and the reasons for holding the'show cause' were never before the council."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for negligent misstatement and breach of contract alleging that the defendant negligently estimated the quantities of product to be handled under the contract and induced the plaintiff to enter a contract into which it was unable to derive anticipated profits and from which it incurred start up costs and operating losses. Defendant awarded $270,307.05 as damages for loss of profits and $10,000 damages for damage to plaintiff's equipment. Defendant's appeal was dismissed on the basis that the trial judge did not make any reviewable error with respect to the facts and that the plaintiff did not suffer any loss as a result of the termination of the contract."

The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were âspecial circumstancesâ within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) This is a case in which the Court should exercise its jurisdiction to remove Evan as an executor. While the power of attorney may give him the power to make decisions for Evan in respect of legal matters, including instructing counsel, she was not entitled to represent him before the Court. By making the application he has, he is effectively stating that he is not prepared to give effect to the directions in the Will. The affidavit evidence satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do and thus he must be removed as an agent.  2) There is no evidence that either of Kent or Rodney have acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the will. Further, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly do their duty."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure â Default Judgment â AppealHELD: The plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs of $1,598.50. Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel now applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff was warned of the impending deadline and asked to continue to hold the funds pending a further order of the Court. Counsel for Key sought costs in any event of the cause on the basis that the default judgement was set aside ex debito justitiae. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim. Even under the Moir J. approach to the interpretation of s. 2(3)(b), the power of Council was not exercised 'pursuant' to the consent of majority of councillors present at a meeting. There was no meeting as required by the legislation. 2) In exercising the judicial discretion under Rule 9-13, the court must also conclude that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending against the action is insufficient to deny Key its day in court."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana. The voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area on which the plants were growing and thus were not entitled to the protection of s.8 of the Charter. He also held that the warrantless search violated the respondents' s. 8 Charter rights. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S. 347, and found that evidence obtained as result of a search is tainted. It may be admissible if its admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers, who were in attendance at the residence as a result of a fire, were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence had admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that it was too late to amend, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove the date of possession of the weapons. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the 5-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years; the husband had worked in the oil rig industry for 10 years, until he terminated his employment in 1989, when he returned to Newfoundland with the wife. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits.Divorce on the basis of the petitioner's income and the child's life insurance and an education fund were not in issue.

2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to proceed with its action. HELD: 1) A delay of over five years is inexcusable and it does not reach the level of serious prejudice described in the ICC case. However, it is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delay.  2) The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim is comparable to that experienced by other cases in which the decision to dismiss is discretionary. As was the case in ICC, this case has now seen the completion of all pre-trial steps excepting for the response to certain undertakings given and still outstanding and the scheduling of pre- trial settlement conference. Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed without further delay. 3) The delay in excess of five years in advancing this case does constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.  4) The onus is on the respondent to convince the court that the facts and circumstances support the conclusion that the delay was excusable. The application for an order returning $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid is not granted. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made are live issues raised by the pleadings. This is an issue that must be determined by the trial judge."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to section 253(b) and (a)of the Code. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat with his seat belt on when the accident occurred and he did not ask to speak to a lawyer. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand and whether the accused was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the Court found that the accused had'reasonable and probable ground' to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v. Leedahl and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period and held that once the accused rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(a), the court could not enter the analysis of whether the de facto care or controls of an inoperability motor vehicle was denied or infringed in any way. 3)The accused had reasonable, probable and reasonable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that the vehicle as contemplated by the Criminal code for the purposes of care and control was impaired by alcohol. The evidence established that the officer had probable and probable reasons to believe the accused could not provide a breath sample either because of his condition and the smell of alcohol from the vehicle; 4)There was no evidence concerning the accused's position in relation to the medical condition of the accused and no suggestion that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. Having found that such a belief is not supported by the evidence, the court concludes that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures at the hospital, including time in the hospital for an assessment; 5)The court also concludes that there is nothing in the language used in the authorities dealing with the death of an accused that would justify a demand for a sample"

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.

He is now charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another serious assault. The Crown alleges that the accused has breached the conditions imposed at that time.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the PPSA applies to the applicant. Section 146(3) provides that an annuitant's account is to remain with the insurer and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a qualifying annuity or transferred to a registered retirement income fund authorized by the Income Tax Act. 2)The applicant had not retired and no pension refund exists. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s.146(2) and s.147(3). 3)The provisions of the Plan Contract and the arrangements in Phenix did not apply. The applicant's application for a declaration that the loan agreement was not in breach of s.57 of the Act and that the provisions in s. 146(12) and (13) were not to be tried in any fashion in accordance with s.148 of the Income tax Act, therefore no security interest exists. 4)The only exceptions were that Crown Life could attach the proceeds pursuant to the terms of the plan to its registered pension savings plan and that it could not collaterally claim the benefit of a pension refund when it revoked the registration. 5)The provision in the plans contract prohibiting any assignment or pledge of her interest under the Group plan and its provisions respecting an attachable pension refund were not dismissed. 6)Taxation was not involved in the application. 7)The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $12,000 to be paid to the pension trustee in the form of a letter to the effect that the tax provisions had been struck and the provisions respecting the pension refund which were not part of the contract. 8)Nothing in the plan contract or the IncomeTax Act prohibits the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired, there appears to be a nomonetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her."

The petitioner separated in October 2003 and agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the respondent. The respondent seeks to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and is opposed to the relocation of the petitioner to Edmonton. The issues on the relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to have with the baby. HELD: 1) The respondent has the child's primary residence in Saskatoon. The child will have access to that residence every day. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the baby's care in Edmonton, the court finds that it is not in the children's best interests to move to Edmonton where the respondent will be an access parent. 3) There is ample evidence that the psychological bond between the respondent and the child is lost if the respondent is allowed to relocate. 4) The evidence on the respondent's ability to access the child at his parent's home has been ample. 5) It is not necessary for the court to deal with this as the parties declined to allow the relocation. 6) The court reviewed the factual background in Rosenau v.

e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister three children. The Department of Social Services had been very much involved since the birth of the oldest child. The Minister had previously ordered the three children to be permanently committed to him. At the conclusion of the hearing held to inquire into the matter, the decision was reserved to permanently commit the children to him; however, pursuant to s. 37(2), the order was also reserved to an open adoption. The children were all children of and L. The mother was diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been placed on medication. Over the years, there have been a number of occasions when the children have been removed from the home to protect them from violence and disharmony in the home when drank.

There was evidence that the children were in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi). There were other instances that showed that the mother simply did not recognize the children's needs and did not want to be the parent. She chose alcohol over both and children."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: 1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the Court found that the tapes were of central importance to the mother and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the motherâs home.  2) The tapes were primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The keynote theme, as orchestrated by the father, is that the mother is deranged and violent but the father will always be there to rescue the children. The children have no fear of either parent. 3) After listening to the tapes in their entirety, the court was of the view they have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. They invested in these partnerships in 1989 and 1996. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directed against the petitioner, his wife, and their holding company, Ashton Holdings Ltd., requiring each of them to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour by the respondent. Ashton filed notice of disputing petition in August 1996. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they becomedue. It was common ground that the respondent paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation was offered for his failure to pay his obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven. 2)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court refusing to issue a receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner's clients as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him.  3)No adequate explanation had been offered by Ashtonfor his failure or refusal to comply with his obligations under the Act.  4)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Court that Ashton is indebted to them in the amount of $1,000.00."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family â Child Support â Arrears â Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queenâs Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellantâs income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellantâs claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellantâs lawyer provided the respondentâs lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondentâs forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellantâs income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellantâs income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judgeâs findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendantâs monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred by misapprehending facts when he found the defendant did not advise him of changes to his circumstances and by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Saskatchewan courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)Canadian courts have not followed Frey. In his decision regarding the 2006 consent order, he held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to s.17 of the Divorce Act. In this case, the court referred to the decision in Frey Frey (1987), 1987 CanLII 4734 (SK CA), RFL (3d) 154 (Sask.) at para 12. The court reviewed the various orders of the Court in the past 10 years and found that: 1)The Court found that the parties had not reached an agreement on the extent to which the defendant was entitled to vary his consent order in accordance with the Guidelines; 2)There was no evidence that either party was aware of the material changes to their circumstances; 3)The defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of the 2009 material changes or to have adjusted his child support accordingly. 4)The court found that a consent order can only be varied if it is necessary to change circumstances. 5)A spousal"
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child. He addressed it as required by law.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant. The charges all arose out of the same incident. The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The Court found that the accused were both the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant and then punched her in the face. The rear window of the car was smashed in. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The actions of the accused and the manner in which they were attacked were aggressive and the accused took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. There was no evidence of an essential element of the offence which was supported by the testimony of the main accused. 2) The two accused admitted to breaking the front passenger window and he probably broke the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. 3) The Court accepted the accused's testimony that they were involved in a fistfight and that the altercation was unnecessary and it was unnecessary for them to use force. They both admitted to getting involved in the altercation and that they both felt threatened.  4) The accused admitted that he choked the complainant at one point during the fight and that he punched the complainant three times. The complainant's testimony was contradicted by the other witness who testified that she had been drinking alcohol at the time of the altercation.  5) With respect to the count of wilful damage to the car, the Court agreed with this procedure. The trial proceeded on information 24614281 and at the close of the trial the Crown and defence evidence was applied to and became the evidence on Information 24417999.  6) The injuries were consistent with fistfights. The defendant was aggressive. She punched the plaintiff three times and he fell off the stairs towards the trailer.  7) The evidence submitted by the accused was that they got into a fist fight in the parking lot of a strip mall. There were lots of punches and kicks by the two accused and they were standing up and punching each other. The plaintiff was forced to walk away from the scene of the assault. The accused choked the plaintiff and he was punched three times while he was standing on the stairs.  8) The court found that although the accused may have been involved in an unnecessary altercation, they were not involved in"
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the appellant's evidence, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt. The court applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence."
7_1992canlii2622.txt,"The trial judge's decision fixing a retroactive effective date for child support was also upheld as there was no error on the part of the trial judge in fixing the date.,the Appeal Division upheld the trial judge's decision which did not include in the division of matrimonial assets a bank account held in the wife's name alone where the uncontradicted evidence of the wife was that the spouses had agreed when the wife went back into the work force that anything she earned would be hers. At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","This was an appeal from a corollary relief judgment dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost on double Column V. 1)The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant met the order with the result that it ceased to contravene the Code. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. 2)The appellants appealed the decision of Matheson J. to this Court on essentially the ground that he erred in failing to find that the board had exceeded its jurisdictional jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant applied to have the Court of Appeal dismiss his summary judgment application on the basis that the chambers judge erred in the application of the test for summary judgment. The chambers judge admitted that the defendant had provided conflicting statements regarding the dog and the fact that it ran onto the highway. The defendant argued that there was no arguable issue to be tried on the application and dismissed the application. The issues were: 1) which affidavit was read and signed by the defendant; 2) which evidence was attached to the affidavit; and 3) which portions of the defendant's discovery evidence, including the statement of the officer who had examined the dog at the scene of the accident, were not properly presented through the other affidavits. The Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test; and 4) the onus did not shift to the plaintiffs to show that their claim had a real prospect of success. All of these issues were dealt with in the chambers decision."

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitionerâs witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondentâs witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondentâs mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Childrenâs Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the childâs relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondentâs relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The childâs need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitionerâs home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondentâs time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the childâs emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitionerâs care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the childâs future. The respondentâs negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the childâs best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitionerâs line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondentâs income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondentâs pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the partiesâ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like âIâm sorryâ and âGet out of here!â The petitionerâs counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held"
b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The defendant cannot now insist that this was an essential and fundamental term of the contract which would entitle him to rescind the contract. 2)The plaintiff received a copy of the executed agreement in the mail. The post office was a legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and to this extent the postal acceptance rule is satisfied. If the defendant is now seeking to break the contract, he must insist that it be expressly stated in the contract before he executes the same. 3)There was a valid contract between Johnson Seeds and Farr. The parties communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. There was no evidence that in the telephone conversations between the parties they discussed the issues of supply and demand, the impurities and hulled seed count were established by the defendant in accordance with procedure and standards used by the Canadian Grain Commission and included as foreign material. 4)Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that the contract was in breach and this is when damagess would be assessed."

HELD: The provisional order was confirmed but the monthly child maintenance was reduced from $300 per child to $50 as the respondent earned approximately $12,000 per year gross. Based on federal guidelines she would be required to pay $142 for the two children but had unusually high costs for exercising access as the former husband lived in Alberta.","The Maintenance Enforcement Office reduced child maintenance from $300 per month to $50 per month for the following reasons: based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00 permonth to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia; however, the respondent has unusually high costs forexercising access as she lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the former husband lives in Calgary, Alberta.

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. A trial before a Queen's Bench judge had issued a judgment dealing with the division of matrimonial property. In issue was the return of the list of items that the petitioner had found missing from the home. HELD: 1)The Court had previously varied its judgment to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of the judgment of December had ever been issued. The Law permits the Court to vary its judgment and give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. 2)The prayer sought variation of Clause No. of the notice of motion. Section 3(a), (b), (c) and 5 of the prayer for relief were amended to include the items listed in said list. 3)The respondent had not even unpacked a good part of what he took away. Since the respondent did not want to cooperate, the Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and its still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that its evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court found that the still photographs and the R.C.M.P. analyst's opinion were not properly admitted into evidence and that, in light of the fact that they were not being introduced at the criminal trial for this purpose, it would have been a reasonable choice not to object to their admission."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.",The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The R.M. council was divided into two factions and the plaintiff moved a motion to tender the contract for building inspection services to the defendant. The defendant opposed the motion and sought legal advice from the plaintiff's legal counsel as to how to handle the issue respecting the perceived conflict of interest. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The restriction placed on the plaintiff was not in her personal capacity. She was free to discuss municipal issues with the ratepayers in his division and within the municipality and with the media and others.  2)She acted with a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. The issue was best dealt with at municipal election. 3)The defendant was acting in good faith in providing advice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did.
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","An application for DNA warrants was made by the prosecutor and, pursuant to s.487.05 of the Code, the accused was required to appear before the judge to swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. The accused was not allowed to testify because of the tape. The court advised the accused that there should be more truth in an officerâs affidavit of Information because he swore it before a provincial court judge or Commissioner of Oaths or a Notary Public, but the judge did not swear it. The officer was allowed to swear it on the application in camera. The courtroom was cleared and people could come back in. The purpose of the court was to make the protocol work in a flexible fashion as it can, not impeding the police in their legitimate role but making sure the court maintains its independence."
7_2017skqb203.txt,Civil Procedure â Pleadings â Statement of Claim â Application to Strike The defendant applied for an order striking the plaintiffâs statement of claim under Queenâs Bench rule 7-9(1)(a) on the basis that under rule 7-9(2)(a) it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S.; and 3) The claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. SaskTel was awarded its costs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to SaskTel. 1) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. 2) The pleadings carefully reviewed the pleadings. The plaintiff's claims against Sasktel have no reasonable prospects of success and should be struck. The pleading or other document disclosed no reasonable defence. Where it is obvious that the only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCA, the claim does not disclose any reasonable cause of action against the Defendant. 3) If the circumstances warrant and one or more conditions pursuant to subrule (2) apply, the Court may order all or any part of pleading or document be struck out; the conditions for that order to be met are that the pleading or any document discloses a reasonable claim or defence, as the case may be; one of the conditions set out in Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 (CanLII), [2011] SCR 45; and 4) the amount of damages claimed."
d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude this evidence. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code, whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before me leading to such a demand. HELD: 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the accused has alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make formal breath demand. The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. Even if one could construe this passage to require a 'consumption alone' to be sufficient, it does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in body. 3) The legislation has removed the process from the consideration of the degree of impairment that is displayed before the demand is made. The test is consumption alone and not its amount or behaviourial consequences. The legislature's priority had removed the processes from the process of considering the degree impairment displayed prior to the judge's consideration of impairment. The court was persuaded that, prior to making the demand, the peace officer must reasonably suspect that a person who is operating a motor vehicle (or who is engaged in any one of the other named activities) has Alcohol in his or her body. If the officer forms the required suspicion, he or she may make a demand that the person provide a sample of breath for analysis in an approved screeningdevice. 4) The officer's objective was not raised in view of the fact that there was no mention of alcohol being detected on the breath samples provided at the scene and at the detachment, she declined to exercise her rights to counsel. 5) Although there was some evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car, and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle, Objectively,"

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or in installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitionerâs category.  1)There had not been a material change in circumstances as the petitioner and respondent had agreed upon the division of the Canada Child Tax Benefit and GST, the manner in which the tax returns were calculated, the standard of conduct of the parties and the hardship occasioned by the release of their judgment in July 2006. 2)The respondent had been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children since the commencement of these proceedings in 1999. 3)The petitioner had not caused any hardship. The respondent had accepted $380.00 per month for all of the children. 4)There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the income tax returns for the past 3 years. The petitioner was not seeking a variation of $380 as she was not disclosing her income tax return in 1997. 5)The court dismissed the application for retroactive child support. Section 25 of the Guidelines provides that courts must strive for a holistic view of the matter and decide each case on the basis of its particular factual matrix. The Supreme Court of Canada reasoning in DBS was applicable. 6)The applicant did not provide any reasonable excuse as to why support was not sought earlier other than concluding the respondent accepted less than the amount set out in the guidelines."

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"The parties were at odds over the issue of who was at fault as matter of law for the collision and subsequent damage. The ultimate disagreement was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff and service costs in the proceedings. HELD: 1)This was one of those rare cases where the scales of justice were evenly balanced. The evidence, taken together with the exhibits, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability in this case because it was at the end of the day equivocal. It could not support either version of the events put forth by the parties. 2)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven. The physical evidence does not assist as a matter of fact because it could support either versions of events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. However, it does not detract from either version. 3)The court was unable to conclude that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) In this case, the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact the police officer was not called to testify. She said it might appear extremely relevant that he was not brought forward to testify on the critical issue of identification. However, the jury was to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver of the white Tempo. It was also to be determined whether the appellant had been driving the vehicle at the time of the offence. The Court noted that R. v. Cook, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1113, indicated that the broad discretion enjoyed by the Crown in the prosecution of offences, including the offence of trafficking, should be set aside. This case did not have the potential to be a'mug' case but rather was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered."

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13. The defendant earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the reduced assessment in March 1997 but in September 1997 the utility and review board issued a refund to the plaintiff. In September 1997, HRM issued a property tax refund cheque to Canada Trust. Canada Trust applied for the interest on the amount overpaid and sought a return of the refund as soon as the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. A rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4%) was the appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March/97 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September/97 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused has an incredible criminal record. It is lengthy and continuous, commencing in 1979 and running to the present. There are 121 convictions, 39 being for property offences, 50 being for fraud and several for non-compliance with court orders. HELD: The accused has been in custody on the subject charges for two years and eleven months. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. In the result, the following sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 Incarceration for 2 years and 6 months, consecutive to the preceding sentences and a Payment surcharge waived as the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 1) The conduct of the accused is most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while he was in prison. It extended over 18 months; involved many separate acts; and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was a long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. It has eliminated the necessity for many people to testify and go through the consequent discomfort. 3) The principles of sentencing remain and did have the assistance of the two cases cited above. Denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority. Any other approach would be detrimental to the administration of justice."
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act and holding that the respondent had been negligent in failing to give notice of his assignment. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The trial judge held that s. 88 of the Act was applicable and set aside the provisions which prohibited an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of a commercial business. He concluded that the sum owing by the respondent was the property of an Indian on a reserve and that if the respondent gave notice he was entitled to the funds held by the Shubenacadie Band on the ground found by the learned Chambers judge. The appeal allowed on the basis that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between the respondent and the defendant finance company meant that there was nothing owing to the respondent at the time the book debts were assigned to Snyder. Therefore, the assignment was void."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 â Meaning of ârelevantâ in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in a building damaged by a fire in October 2007. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location. In May 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the premises and sought production of all documents relating to the second fire, specifically: a complete copy of investigative files prepared by government authorities, the Town of Stellarton Fire Department, any photographs of the aftermath of the fire, any internal investigation, any of the file of any insurers who carried out investigations and any files of any insurance company that carried out investigation. The defendants argued the documents were relevant to the action. Dismissing the motion for production without further evidence would only serve to sanction a fishing expedition, as stated in Murphy vs. Lawtons Drugs Stores Limited, 2010 NSSC 289. As a result the motion is dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. plus disbursements, payable forthwith. In issue was whether documents related to the subsequent fire in May 2009 at another location were relevant documents that occurred in this proceeding as it relates to the issue of negligence. The party seeking production has the onus of establishing its relevance. Rule 14.08 contains a presumption of full disclosure of relevant documents. The presumption is rebuttable. Rule 15 imposes a duty on defendant to disclose the plaintiff's documents. This requires motions judge to decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. Brown vs. Cape Breton Regional Municipality, [2011 NSCA 32]Rule 14.01 provides that relevant and relevant documents have the same meaning as at the trial of an action or on the hearing of an application and, for greater clarity, both of the following apply on a determination of relevenancy under this Part: (a) judge who determines the releviancy of document, electronic information, or other things sought to be disclosed or produced must make the determination by assessing whether a judge presiding at a trial or hearing of the proceeding would find the document relevant or irrelevant; (b) a determination is not binding at the beginning of the action or at the end of the application and (c) the determination is relevant and irrelevant. In this case, the relevant documents were the plaintiffs' documents."

The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. While the father's counsel argues that the delay since interim reasons were filed in December has resulted in a new status quo, there has only been one occasion only during that period when the children did not have access to both parents in any six-day period (leaving aside the January vacation which appeared to be part of the status quo). This is to be contrasted with the access proposed by the father for the upcoming 2 months which would see the children not having overnight access or indeed, any access, to their mother during four 6-day periods until the appeal is heard. The judgment roll 'vacates' the order of the Court of Appeal which imposed the stay."

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253 of the Criminal Code. The Crown obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Peace in January 2009. The warrant resulted in the blood samples being taken from the accused. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant, whether the information was a reasonable grounds for an accused's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter, and whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. HELD: 1) The officer who signed the document admitted that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the accused, who had been driving his vehicle that early morning, was involved in an accident and was in no condition to consent to taking samples of his blood. 2) The information which the officer had deposed in the document was not a reasonable ground for the accused's belief that he was the driver of the vehicle. The information to be admitted was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant.  3) There was no breach of the accusedâs s.8 rights pursuant to the Charter. The officer did not omit crucial ground for his belief, namely that the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol. 4) There were witnesses at the scene of the accident who observed the accused lying face-down on the ground in front of the car. 5) The evidence heard on the voir dire was that the officer swore the information before the Justice of the Peace at 3:30 a.m. on January 10, 2009. He did not include the source of his belief that the driver was not wearing a seat belt or that the buttocks to be situated on the side of the body were not in the vehicle and there was no evidence of anyone fleeing from the vehicle after the accident.  6) The affidavit material did not constitute reasonable grounds of belief for the officer to have sworn. 7) The fact that more detail can lend greater credibility to an information than a boiler plate does not mean that the information must be more in the nature of a finding of fact.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondentâs request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the partiesâ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondentâs home; 7) objections to one of the petitionerâs affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the childâs transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two daysâ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle childâs skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two daysâ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two daysâ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The court granted the judgment and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present. The matter will therefore proceed to trial. The court has not dealt with the issue of the petitioner's participation in wrestling. This child is now 5 days old and the other children are still infants. The respondent indicated she would be the primary parent with the children. Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues. The third child (ages 1 and 5) was already enrolled in the private program. An application to vary the existing parenting arrangements was made in light of the state of the family property."

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. All jurisdictional elements have been proven. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2) The parties agreed in the interim that their child would not be removed from his home and that their agreement of joint custody would not affect his mobility. 3) The father agreed to pay child support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances of the parties lives. It is clearly unequal favouring the wife. There was no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. 4) The mother was to have sufficient income to run her business. The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 5) The respondent was to assume all his business expenses including business tax, fees, insurance, 100% of his motor vehicle expenses and travel. The respondent had no reason to exclude any of his personal expenses from his allowance. 6) The petitioner had the benefit of a matrimonial home which she planned to rent in the coming year. She was to receive a capital cost deduction of $10,625 for an annual income of $22,878. 7) The court reviewed the net earnings, purchasing and net profits of the respondent and the paternal grandparents. The court found that the respondent had a conscientious choice in that he did not seek to limit his access to the home and was prepared to give his equity in the home to assure that his child would remain in the area. The paternal grandparents had similar interests in keeping the petitioner and her child in the jurisdiction. Thus the agreement as see it was signed had become an issue that requires review. The Court ordered an increase in access."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)G.A.D. is caused by a sedative deficiency in the brain and is related to depression. 2)The accused has been diagnosed as suffering from general anxiety disorder. The symptoms of this disorder must be manifest for at least 10 minutes before a diagnosis of panic attack can be made. 3)The medical evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or that his evidence and the evidence and evidence of the doctor raise a reasonable suspicion as to the possibility of him being in such an attack."
d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation of the appeal book and certification of the approximately 1,700 pages of transcript she had typed herself or, in the alternative, allow her to file all required materials electronically, including uncertified transcripts. The respondents' motions to dismiss her two appeals and to have them pay the cost of certifying the transcript were granted. The Court dismissed the appellant's motions for dismissal on the basis that they had failed to comply with Rule 90.40(2) of the Rules and the motion for the respondents' payment to certify the transcript. Given that the dismissal of her Criminal Appeal prevents the appellant from having the merits of her appeal determined, which she makes clear are of vital importance to her personally and which she believes are also of great public importance because they involve finding that she was Not criminally responsible with respect to the public mischief charge, no dates have been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appealed because of her seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that on April 27, 2002, he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)On the evidence, the accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at least 140 milligrams percent. 2)The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 3)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused.  4)The accused's blood alcohol content was at or near.08. The Court gave careful consideration to the evidence of the alleged erratic driving and the accused's explanation for it. The accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during 2 minutes. 5)There was nothing unusual about the accused driving on a divided highway in light traffic. He was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he made in an abrupt manner as he passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. He did not display any mental confusion or noteworthy inappropriate behaviour. He conducted himself in a rational and reasonable manner."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","This was a motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the mother asked for a dismissal of the matter on the basis that the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. Because the trial was scheduled to start tomorrow, the agency had no opportunity to reapprehend. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial court conducted the trial prior to the statutory overall deadline and, with 13 days left within which to implement its jurisdiction, made a disposition order purporting to last months. The trial court could have made such an order for the 13 days remaining; but because the order was to last beyond that 13th day, it acted without jurisdiction. 2)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and, it will commence tomorrow."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The victim of a car robbery was found in the car with the gun and stolen property, in the company of two young men who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car, loaded. The victim was not asked to implicate the victim directly but said that he had been picked up in a building somewhere in Fairview and it would beg the question as to why he was doing that and what else he might be saying that was not true. HELD: The evidence of the victimâs involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the police officer was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the officer was just wrong. The evidence established that the person who was picked up by the police at the scene of the robbery was not the person they had picked up. There was no direct drive from the address in Sackville to the place on Northwest Arm Drive where the car was stopped. The police officer said nothing about stopping anywhere. The crime was committed in high risk take-down and the descriptions of the men who were in the vehicle matched the description given by the Crown witness. It was logical to assume that the accused, who had not been in the courtroom when the police stopped the car and who had been there when it was stopped, was one of the people who picked up the stolen items."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃÂ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully harvesting forest products and found that it should have quashed the sentence. The conviction was upheld on the basis that there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the illegal sale of the wood was not the subject matter of this appeal. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. On the factual grounds, the standard of review is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. The defendant was found not guilty on the trafficking charge because the evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. The appeal court may allow a Crown appeal where, although not properly convicted on an offence, the defendant was convicted of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, but only for the purpose of determining if the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitratorâs decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008. The contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The respondent sought to have the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The IDSL was the primary operating agreement and was automatically renewed for successive 3 year terms, unless either party cancelled the contract in writing at least 60 days prior to the renewal date. In this case, HAL took the position that the IDSL, as amended by the SCA and ESMA, did not impose an obligation on the respondent to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, HAL's claim was dismissed. HELD: The application was dispositive. Even if the conclusion in that respect had been different, the court would still not have granted leave. 1)A term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. 2)HAL cannot appeal the arbitratorsâ decision, and the application must be dismissed. If the right to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the agreements, then the court does not have licence to reconstruct the contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 3)The use of the word 'final and binding' in this sense is not akin to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, but rather reflects the intention of the parties and the very limited nature of potential appeals. 4)The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which an appeal would be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) indicates that the parties turned their minds to the question of dispute resolution, which, except on that very narrow issue, intended to allow the arbitration panel to reach a final decision. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She claimed a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The experts filed by the defendant remained uncontradicted and the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence to support their allegations. The court found that the defendant was not and never had been liable for the accident and that the accident occurred because of his failure to observe the standard of care and because the evidence did not support his allegations of negligence. Further, the plaintiff did not provide any further evidence respecting foreseeability or causation and argued that her discovery evidence was not bare allegation, but a material fact that if accepted at trial would give the plaintiff a real chance of success."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs, buttocks, breasts and vaginal area. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had touched her buttocks only once and then fell on top of her. The complainant said that this was because he tripped over her younger sister who was lying on the floor. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. 2)The accused is not guilty of all of the offences. He is not a person who is prone to paranoid delusions or paranoid delusions. He has explanations for his behaviour. There is no doubt that he is a sexual predator. The only person who would have been more likely to believe him is the accused himself. The circumstantial evidence of paranoid delusions and paranoid delusions is not sufficient to confirm his allegations. He would be wrong to assume that all the evidence surrounding his behaviour and those of his ilk, including the sexual assault allegations, is circumstantially supported by the evidence of other sexual predators. It would not be appropriate for a Court to take judicial notice of his outrageous behaviour and the fact that he was drunk at the time he was charged. Although the accused is from Saskatchewan and raised in the province, his evidence is that he has always lived in a house that is near the residence of his estranged wife. The Court would be remiss not to take this evidence into account if it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his behaviour was dangerous and unconscionatory, bordering on paranoid, and bordering on psychopathic, both of which would be supported by evidence of his psychopathic and sexual immorality. The Judge would not have taken this evidence seriously and would have done more to confirm and confirm the accused's allegations than any other expert witness in the area of sexual behaviour."

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caretaker of the children and her role was to report to the father final decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their relationship with the father. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, plus the pre-marital pension benefits. The parties were to obtain a date on their docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and whether, as a result of that analysis, any change is required to the terms of the order. Children to be in the joint custody of the father and mother. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was credible. It was possible that, after careful review of all of the factors in s9(a), court would come to the conclusion the full table guideline amount is the proper amount of child support. HELD: 1)Section 9(a) requires the court to take the financial situation of both parents into account. The provision does not include a conclusive formula to determine how the table amounts are to be calculated. The role of the court is not to determine which parent is better but to decide which plan for the child's care will best meet the objectives of their children. The court retains the discretion to reduce parent's child support downward from the Guidelines amount if there is no indication the parents would likely overcome the conflict that had arisen between them. 2)Costs in the amount of $50,000 are not to be determined on a case by case basis. 3)There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The evidence indicated that the father would not place the children in an inadequate care situation. 4)The evidence did not support the idea that the child needed counseling. 5)The court would not order counseling if the children were to suffer irreparable harm."

Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellantâs condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result; (b) in finding it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. Allowing the appeal on the basis that the appellant was a flight risk and that he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate, the court found."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without the terms of two execution orders previously issued against the plaintiff judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. The plaintiff moved to have the orders, which had been issued in 2010 and 2011, confirmed by affidavit evidence of the third party debtor. HELD: The order was refused. The court was unable to grant the requested order. It was not clear from the affidavit evidence where the loans came from or if they will reduce the exigible assets, available for execution, were available for that matter."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)There will be instances where the defence will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation and there will be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  2)In Provincial Court it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. In the case of R. v. Kutynec (1992), 52 O.A.C. 59, 12 C.R. (4th) 152 (C.A.), the court dismissed the proposal. Rather than inventing structured procedures for Charter applications in Provincial Court trials, rather than using a rigid, time-consuming procedure, the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. There is no evidence suggesting that the Crown should have these people to attend as witnesses if, in their assessment, the testimony of such witnesses is required in support of the application to exclude evidence. In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his maternal grandmother, the mother paid his grandmother $400 per month for room and board and she gave an allowance. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in the east side, to accommodate what he understood was Michael's interest in moving in with his grandmother and Jerrilyn, his older sister. The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. HELD: 1) The mother's income was $25,672.37. The father's proportionate share was 80% and the mother's was 20%. The current s. 7 expenses total $4,261.00 yearly. 2) The father was to pay $284.00 in December 2007 for the s. 8 expenses. 3) The parties were to produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is not necessary that there be a written agreement or court order to this effect before the onus can be discharged, the court should exercise caution in awarding child support in shared custody situations to ensure fairness. The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. 4) Costs in the amount of $500 are payable forthwith."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely, that the appellant had been drinking, that he had bloodshot red eyes, his mouth appeared to be dry, he was rubbing his lips and he smacked his lips even when he was not talking and that, having worked with the appellant in the past, he had not been informed of his right to counsel when the tests were performed; and that observations concerning slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being permitted to drive constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The learned judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who testified at the scene as to the appellant's level of intoxication. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not an admissible evidence at trial as evidence of impairment, there is no inherent improbability in the observations concerning the impairment of the accused. The observations were corroborative of other symptoms of impairment that were noted by the police officers. 3)The appellant could say with his limited exposure that the accused had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and his speech was lacking in any detail and he was as well smacking his lips.

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.

The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","Electric, a closely held company, sued the appellant in 2004 for accounting, damages and injunctive relief.

After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, and on the facts of this case, the court decided that it should not exercise its discretion to grant the release without a review. Allowing the release, that the court misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application and that if a review was ordered, the issue of whether or not a person on a day parole is in custody would never have arisen. At the time, the appellant was serving his time in custody in penitentiaries. Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to section 679(1) of the Code, the Crown issued a written decision on October 19, 1999, granting the released with conditions.

The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.

It was a civil burden. It must have regard to the seriousness. 5) There were no reasonable changes in the circumstances.

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

He entered not guilty plea and requested the first available date for trial (December 18, 2003). It was anticipated that one full day would be required as the Defense intended to make a Charter motion and lead evidence.

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that the lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act and that the responding plaintiff failed to show that his claim had a real chance of success. Gilbert also appealed to the Supreme Court alleging that the judge erred in granting Chrysler's motion. Appeal dismissed. The material facts were not in dispute. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff, while driving the leased vehicle, was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries and the insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak), which permit a person to rent a vehicle without the owner's permission and to have the rights to do so with the express or implied permission of the owner. Both issues dealt with vicarious liability at common law. The appellants and the respondent both argued that the Chambers judge erried in failing to apply the law in Bazley v. Curry, [1999] S.C.R. 534, and the law that has developed since that case was decided. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the appellant. 1)The Chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts.  2)The lease agreement fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.'  3)In Bazley, supra, the Court was addressing whether non-employee/employee relationship was a situation distinct from a'rental contract' as defined in s 62. Further support for the Bazley decision can be found in s. 61, which falls under the heading of 'For Rent Cars'. 4)In this case, the appellants, Gilbert and the defendant were involved in a motor vehicle accident. Gilbert sued the appellant, her insurer and Chrysler for compensation in respect of injuries she sustained in the accident. The defendant was not acting as a servant or agent of Chrysler in the operation of the vehicle.

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving in a manner dangerous to the public. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The court found the accused guilty of both counts. The evidence of the accused that he did not strike the complainant was overwhelming. The Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the accusedâs intention.  2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant in the face. He admitted purchasing one gram of marijuana and then driving the truck dangerously close to the complainant while she was laying on the driveway. There was no evidence that the complainant fell on the ground or that the accused got aggressive and kicked the complainant on two occasions. However, the evidence of tire marks which were consistent with the injuries sustained by the complainant when the accused backed up the truck and came forward on more than one occasion and hit the complainant with his fist. 3) The Crown was found to have proven the guilty count beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. It was not reasonable to expect the accused to lie to the court and lie to protect the public in such a manner as to endanger the public's safety."

The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified. Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds. His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time the mother and father abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia. The child was to have his access time for the remainder of August, pursuant to the terms of this decision. The mother acknowledged this to be the case.  1) Given the facts of this matter, it was in the child's best interests to lift the stay imposed on the sentence under Rule 15(1). This, in many cases, puts the incentive on the father to perfect his appeal, should he still wish to do so. 2) The fact that the matter has the potential to give rise to more problems than it does address, the stay is lifted. 3) There can be no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay were lifted. There was no evidence that the father would be better able to facilitate this need in the best interests of the child. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the access to his mother and sister especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern."

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan with the intention of obtaining joint custody with principal residence with the father. The father applied to vary the judgment in order to have the children move out of Saskatchewan where they had lived since the divorce and into a new community with the mother. Counsel for the mother opposed the application on the grounds that it would result in the children uprooting from their home in Melfort and moving to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The mother was granted reasonable access. 2)The father was granted generous access. 3)The move was not unreasonable.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants, McMillan LLP and Michael Friedman (collectively 'McMillan'), are two of the defendants in the within action commenced by the proposed respondent, Melvin Schneider (the representative plaintiff). In his statement of claim, the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence by the defendant. The Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The respondents then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and Rule 49 of the Supreme Court of appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(C) application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 1) the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to properly apply the Ann's test or by failing to consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty of care applicable to the individuals; 2) the tax opinions provided by the lawyer were essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim at this juncture; and 3) the judge cannot be said to have erred by not taking these factors into account when dealing with the Rule173(c)."

Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voirs dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. They are not required to establish a prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest. There must be a valid objective served by the search.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified.

In addition to ongoing support for the partiesâ oldest child, Corry and the two youngest children, he also ordered that he pay 66% of the child support expenses for the 2006/2007 university year.

The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. HELD: The application was granted and the evidence obtained by the search was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. The police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by their sources."

Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that the police investigation had indicated that they would not be proceeding with criminal charges. Because the program was unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that you were a victim of a crime, we were unable to make a compensation award. The appellant appealed.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accusedâs stepmother called him early in the morning with the news that there had been a police raid on the home she shared with the accused. The police found two guns, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. At issue was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. HELD: 1)The accused was presumed to be innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The evidence collected from the accused was that the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in a box in the master bedroom of their home.  3)Evidence collected through various case management conferences and the assistance of the Canada Firearms Centre had not been dispensed with.  4)Although evidence collected at the scene of the search had been considered at trial, it was not accepted that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones that were located in the other two individualsâ home. The evidence collected through the course of the trial was that of a witness. The witnessâ testimony did not meet the burden of proof and there was no suggestion of a continuity problem.  6)Evidence obtained through the destruction of the evidence and the exchange of photographs between the parties was not considered relevant to the charges. 7)Statutes of the Custody and Interpretation of the Evidence and the Access to Information Act were not to be relied upon. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the search of the premises. 8)The Crown had not established that the contents of the three guns seized were a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code and a section of Part II of the Regulations. 9)Countries were not required to accept the evidence of the persons who possessed the firearms at the time of their arrest. 10)Counts were not issued pursuant to the Part VI authorization.  11)The essential issue on the firearms seized from the victims was whether Kyle had constructive possession of them.  12)"

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

The petitioner was awarded costs of $1,200.00 payable by the respondent.  2)The court reviewed the SAGEG as a guide only and found that retroactive support preceding commencement of the proceedings ought not to be granted in an application for interim support. The court found that assuming the circumstances in which the petitioner had taken this action changed materially in the past 3 years leading up to this action, the respondent should be given effective notice that she was now seeking additional support. 3)The petitioner did not seek to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income based upon significant overtime income."

The Court found that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding the accident to conclude that the blood demand was a legitimate demand for sample and that he had not waived his right to counsel as required by law. Furthermore, the accused demonstrated an honest and reasonable understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. There was no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the accused's vehicle."

The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for a stay of proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal. This stay was granted in 1995 and the Hearing Committee met intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time for firstly because the court had imposed a stay and then because the criminal matters were still before the court. The applicant appealed his conviction and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He appealed the conviction and sought leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave was denied on May 22, 1997. The last two sentences in the third paragraph on p.3 of the judgment should be deleted as they may enable him to escape upon a technicality.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. The first proposed basis is that the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days would be admissible on a basis that the accused's decision whether to testify would more likely than not be the same in relation to both sets of counts. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. The interests of justice encompass the accusedâs right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. Whatever use was made of the firearm on April 8 would not touch on who might have had knowledge and control of it on April 14. The videotaped statement to police was common piece of evidence to both events. On an application to sever a multi-count indictment, the overarching criteria are the interests and justice of justice. It is important to note that Litchfield, where the Crown was prevented from arguing the case properly because of an unjudicial severance order, does not necessarily be a better ground of departure for the accused because of the multiplicity of offences and the fact that the interests, especially in the context of justice, require a trial on one or more of the counts."

Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and the child shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. She has made choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that Kaira sees both parents. Accordingly, the cost of transporting the child to and from Victoria shall be borne by Lesly and not by the petitioner. However it is fair that the petitioner contribute something to this cost. 2) Costs in the cause are to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241, 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321. Both Shiplack, supra and Stomp, supra are exceptions to the general approach that is to be maintained unless there are compelling reasons not to do so as were found in both cases. There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The parties lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the outset of this relationship, the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. sought the continued intervention of the Agency. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child, who had run from her mother's home and stayed with her paternal uncle in [...]. The Agency applied for a protection order from Nova Scotia which required the children to be placed in the custody of T.B.'s common law partner, who was to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children who had been apprehended by the Agency and who became the guardian and foster parent of the children, respectively. The protection order was dismissed in February 2006. The children were placed with their father, who lived in a supervised care home with his sister, who in turn remained with the mother until her death in December 2005. The father did not participate at the disposition review, although he participated in previous hearings. HELD: The court found that the information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the agency's decision. It would appear that the Agency was responding appropriately to the children's current situation. The court ordered the supervision order to be dismissed as the Agency had failed to take proper steps to protect the children.

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The complainant was flabbergasted by the charges and believed that there was never ever any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. 2)The accused gave his evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. He was vigorously cross-examined. While his recollection was not perfect and his evidence was not consistent on every point, believe that he did his best to relate his evidence as accurately as he could recall it. 3)There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21 and the same cannot be said about the events of August 21."

He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant applied for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: Application dismissed. The applicant does not have the resources to discharge this liability now, nor in the next several years. He is entitled to relief under subsection 178(2)(g). The debt in effect can't be cancelled or affirmed. Counsel for the AG advised that it does not question the applicant's good faith with respect to the loan. Accordingly, the court will only review what find to be evidence respecting the other requirement under this subsection, whether his financial difficulty is so extensive that he will be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan; it would take many years to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The father of two little boys claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor were wrongfully accused of physically and sexually abusing him. HELD: The Court dismissed the application for variation. The Court held that the information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given. The purpose behind the legal action was to bankrupt the wife so that she would be unable to oppose an application by the father to change the joint custodial arrangement. In the best interest of the children, the trial should never have taken place. The allegations of physical and sexual abuse were found to be entirely without basis in fact. The evidence did not support the allegations of abuse by the mother. The co-defendants, who had obtained a consent order directing compensatory Christmas access to the father, committed libel and threatened to libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father.

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. HELD: 1) The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. The defendant, SkyService, is vicariously liable for the acts of the defendants, as they acted throughout in their capacity as employees of SkyService and/or as agents and designates. The defendants deny any negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement on their part. 2) Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with respect to its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways which involved a claim against a commercial passenger airline and package tour operator arising from a crash landing. Although the claimants had no right of recovery against the defendants in relation to purely psychological injuries, liability was established against the tour operator for psychological injuries not because he was not covered by the Convention but because of the express terms of contract as between the plaintiff and the plaintiff which allowed for the recovery of such damages.

d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother sought retroactive support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay; the Sylvan Learning Centre costs were necessary and reasonable; the mother's evidence disclosed that both children were in need of a specialized educational program given their current problems at school; the father's share of both childcare costs and the Learning Centre expense was equal to 71% of the total cost. HELD: 1) The Court was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father had not taken steps to research alternative programming.  2) The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. 3) The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400. 4) The court ordered that the cost of preparing the application be divided equally between the mother and father. 5) The cost of providing the child with access was $1,650 per month. The Childview program costs for Kody for the summer of 2007 were $7,800 per year. The childcare costs were included in the child's annual income and income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085. The father's portion of the child support payment would be $960 per month, with his proportionate share being equal to 72% of total cost; and the school fees were added to the total costs.  6) The child was in a half-time program for students with learning disabilities. The mother had commenced making reasonable child support payments in the fall of 2006. Although the father was not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance, he did not provide any evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him was resolved. If the mother wished to pursue retroactive matters she may do so when and if this matter proceeds further to pre-trial. 7) In the matter before the Court, the Court found that s. 7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was directed to give priority to child support in determining child and child support applications.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure â Queenâs Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queenâs Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowersâ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Creditâs claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand a class of some 6,000 potential claimants, none of whom have been given notice of the interpleading application or of the application. The argument that Ag Credit has advanced premiums on behalf of its clients and thus any overpayment of premiums arising under the contract are its property is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients' class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as a class are entitled to receive the surplus, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involve the interests of other persons. 3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate manner of addressing the issue of entitlement to the surplus funds, the evidence available to the Court clearly indicates that the insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag Credit that it has paid premiums directly to it. The insurer may apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court, if any, as it deems necessary, and make appropriate orders as to notice and procedure to deal with adverse claims. 4) While some of the borrowers may have defaulted in payment of loan obligations and/or related insurance premiums and Ag Credit may have chosen to nonetheless pay the premiums on their behalf, there is no evidence that this type of payment has occurred within the confines of the Act."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1 year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. His belief in the existence of photographs enhanced the complainant's credibility. There was some evidence that could amount to an error of fact but no miscarriage of justice resulted. 2)The court found that the trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist or by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone.  3)Although correctly articulating the test used in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the court was unable to conclude that his belief in that the appellant's evidence had influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 4)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and an order to be made in s. 686 are granted."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. However, the defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the produce department, and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by plaintiff. The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. 3)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the owner and occupier, had any reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' described in Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs Ltd. (1991), Maurice J. proposed a four part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care to an invitee. 4)There were no logs filed by the defendants prior to the date of the incident. If any, they were destroyed by the impact of the impact on the plaintiff. 5)No logs were filed with respect to the time the plaintiff had to vacate the premises to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve.  6)Statutes filed as required by the simplified procedure included the names and addresses of persons who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the events. Notes and medical reports were not filed with the court. Notes were not prepared for the purpose of this inquiry. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing which may have caused symptoms of PTSD. The Court found these factors to be aggravating factors but the respondent failed to take them into account in assessing her potential sentence. The issues were not in dispute. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief as well as two convictions for not abiding by the conditions in her probation order. The parties agreed upon the range of sentences for manslaughter and the only cases referred to the court were Hathway, supra, and Schoenthal. The judge did not embark on an analysis of the kind set out in Laberge but that authority does not require judge to explicitly enunciate every factor considered in coming to his conclusion. The court found the respondent was found to have compelling personal circumstances that led her to commit the offence, namely, the trauma suffered as a result of the child's death, which included multiple fractures and blunt force trauma to the head, feet and head, which led to his unconsciousness and ultimately his death. These were mitigating factors but not sufficient to warrant a higher sentence."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused and the surety. HELD: The application for forfeiture was dismissed. 1) The surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  2) The accused has had enough on his plate and is experiencing enough negative factors to outweigh his jurisdiction. The court has concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.
3_2001skqb347.txt,An application for certiorari and mandamus. In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,"An application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision by a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue was whether the Court had discretion to refuse having regard to the provisions of s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct the applicant have counsel appointed to him.  He had no jurisdiction to decline the request.  2)The Youth Court's discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. Inability may be asserted for other reasons and the court is entitled to inquire into the foundation. In R. v. J.H. the young person refused to be represented by legal aid counsel and applied for court appointed counsel of his own choice. He argued he ought to be able to discharge his counsel without disclosing that his parents were both on social assistance and would likely be unable to provide financial assistance. The lawyer advised the court that his aunt was unable to assist him financially. The youth court judge asked why the lawyer did not stick with his Legal Aid lawyer and the lawyer replied that it was because he was messing up in court and not coming to court. Counsel for the applicant dismissed the application.  3)It has been held that once young people makes request of the Youth Court for representation by counsel the language of s.(4)(b) on plain reading makes it abundantly clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. 4)The young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge the counsel for whatever reason and insist on the appointment of substitute counsel."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000.

The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed.

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

The Provincial Court judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'Breathalyzer' demand. That decision was not under appeal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the tenant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the tenant. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and believed that the landlord, Koch, had made an error in law in allowing her to move into his home. Koch denied any wrongdoing and argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for vacation in favour of the tenant and the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant was one of contract and did not create any interest in land owned by the tenant for the purposes of estoppel or otherwise. 2)The hearing officer did not err in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter a written tenancy agreement. Section 20 of the Act provides for a hearing officer to determine whether a tenant has the right to possess a rental unit pursuant to s.2(f)(i) and s.7(f) of the rental unit. Section 21 of the Trade Union Act states that a landlord is an owner's agent or another person who, on behalf of the owner, grants to another person the exclusive right of tenancy to rental unit for insurance purposes. 3)The Hearing Officer made no errors in law. The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. 4)Section 7 of the Charter gives rise to the term tenancy by virtue of the fact that it contains the standard conditions (e.g. the date and place of hearing, the address for service and the telephone number of the landlord or the landlord's agent) and the terms of an order respecting the right of a tenant to pay rent. 5)Section 8 of the Code provides for an order of possession if a dispute arises between a landlord and a tenant and if the tenant has a tenancy agreement with respect to certain specified rights or privileges. 6)Section 9 of the Common Law applies to written tenancy agreements. One of the factors cited in this case was the fact the Hearing officer had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. The Hearing Officer adopted the same words and phrases used in the following cases: 'tenancy agreement'; 'owner's agent'; 'lord' means landlord; tenant; landlord; agent. Section 7"

The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against the defendant for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford.

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the respondent had custody of the children and the applicant had reasonable access on reasonable notice. The respondent waived any claim to further spousal support, subject to payment by the applicant of $500 per month continuing only until April 15, 1998. HELD: 1)A variation order would be made in accordance with the applicable Guidelines. Based on an annual income of $24,000 the applicant's child support obligation is $341 per month for the two children. However, s17(6.2) permits the court to make a child support order that is different than the amount that would otherwise be determined in such an order if it is satisfied that there are special provisions in an order, judgment or written agreement respecting the financial obligations of the spouses, or the division or transfer of their property, directly or indirectly benefit a child, or that special provisions have otherwise been made for the benefit of child; and that the application of the applicable guidelines would result in an amount of child support that is inequitable given those special provisions. 2)There was no change in the circumstances of the respondent or either child disclosed in the material filed. 3)The applicant had experienced a significant reduction in her income since 1997 and had been unable to obtain employment which compensated her at a level commensurate with that received while employed by the federal government."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.

S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings which had been converted into apartment units.

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered.

The appellantÂs evidence about the involvement of ChildrenÂs Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judgeÂs reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judgeÂs reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's testimony and finding that it did not raise a reasonable doubt are based on errors of fact.  2) The appellant's evidence about the involvement of Children's Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The judge ascribed to the evidence of the complainant's mother the relevance of this evidence. The inference drawn from this evidence could not have been more unjustified. 3) The trial judge misapprehended evidence. It may consist of a mistake as to substance or of a questionable interpretation of evidence that is not available to the court in law or in logic on this record. In the circumstances of this case, either use reveals a chain of reasoning unavailable to the law or logic on a record."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position as a senior geophysicist. The position was based on a contract between the parties that required the plaintiff to give 30 days notice of termination if the company desired to terminate the contract. The defendant refused, and the plaintiff went into deep depression. He underwent treatment for several years and then quit work. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice. He alleged that this clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant but rather to a period of time when the contract would terminate. Awarding the plaintiff $500.00 in salary and benefits, that the 30 day notice provision in the contract did not abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given."

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","HELD: The application was dismissed. In the circumstances, the court found that it was not appropriate to make an order for interim spousal support. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay 40% of the net income of the corporation to the petitioner and that the interspousal contract did not contemplate a variation of spousals support obligation in the event of a material change in circumstances. The petitioner had the right to continue with her homeopathy training and education in order to set up a homeopathy practice. Although the respondent's employment had ended in April 2004, the petitioner had continued her course in hairdressing. The respondent's current contract with the Provincial Government stipulated that he would pay $25,000 per month as table support until July 2011, when the agreement was incorporated into a consent judgment. The parties agreed that they would proceed to a pre-trial conference and trial if necessary on the question of whether the respondent is obliged to pursue work in his field as a computer consultant.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant sought to vary spousal support in accordance with the terms of their Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who is now independent of the respondent. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and the parties divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the respondent granted a corollary relief judgment incorporated into the agreement. The applicant applied under s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act to vary the spousals of the parties' agreement. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. Although both parties were in their early fifties when the parties received their doctorate, the marriage had lasted less than two years and the applicant had spent time and money trying to obtain employment. Both parties wanted a final agreement so as to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings. Retirement was contemplated by both parties and by the respondent assumed that she would be able to obtain a mortgage on a home acquired by the applicant but that was offset by the husband's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature.  3)The agreement was binding. There were no changes in circumstances since the signing. The husband was left essentially debt free while the husband was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. 4)There had been no material change in the circumstances of either party. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines were not law. The agreement was crafted to reflect the times and circumstances of each party.  5)There were no adverse consequences to the application in light of the new circumstances (e.g. the reduction in legal fees and accounting fees relating to the divorce proceedings and these variations proceedings) but it was a debt that was voluntarily assumed.  6)The applicant had the assistance of very experienced counsel. She borrowed $150,000 on line of credit, using her home as security, to purchase mutual funds as an investment. She received a lump sum to offset the interest on the mortgage."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime contrary to ss. 354(a) and 355(b)of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, unlawfully using or causing a forged document to be used, and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b).

Dismissing the application for a stay, that the accused has not established that there have been breaches of this right within reasonable time, and society's interest will not parallel that of the accused. HELD: The accused's charges are absolute jurisdiction offences as per s. 553 of the Code.  1) The Court found that society as a whole has an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are treated humanely and fairly. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand for the accused to be brought to trial. 2) The accused does not have the means to justify an early trial. There is, by its very nature, a societal interest that is adverse to the interests of the individual. 3) In some cases, the accused doesn't have the necessary resources to ensure that proceedings take place while evidence is available and fresh. 4) The actions of the Crown, such as disclosure delays, change of venue applications, changes of solicitor, challenges to search warrants and adjournments which are voluntarily undertaken and do not count toward the unreasonableness of the overall delay. 5) There is also a secondary societal interest, which is by its nature adverse to interests of an accused."

When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge.

He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend.  2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was stayed by the Crown. 3)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a constructive excuse includes all defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 4)The legislation could be amended to provide new excuses or excuses or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses.

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event services are provided by the trucking association. HELD: Each case was dismissed.  1)The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. Even if the case on entitlement had been made out, the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation. 2)Each case is dismissed."

Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT. The first plaintiff brought an interlocutory application seeking an order for production of documents by the defendants. The second plaintiff sought an order in respect to the plaintiffs documents. HELD: Application dismissed. Documents relating to the franchise agreement, lease, advertising, signage, and other documents were not privileged and must not be produced. The defendants had undertaken to produce these documents so that they could be seen by the public.  1)The affidavits, tapes, and licensee agreement were all found to be relevant. 2)The application was dismissed in any event of the cause. 3)The plaintiff was not entitled to compel the defendants to produce any documents other than the statement of claim. 4)The requested documents related to the history of the plaintiff corporation and its dealings with the operators of the franchises. 5)Any documents relating to advertising were deemed relevant. 6)The request was so broad and general that it would require the defendant to literally produce every piece of paper in their possession. Much of that would be irrelevant. 7)All agreements between the two defendants as they relate to the franchises and their dealings with other persons who were potential operators in the Prince Albert area or who actually became such operators were privileged and therefore admissible evidence. 8)Each party had brought an application and had been successful at least in part. The broad relevance as opposed to a narrow or strict relevance is the applicable test. 9)Any costs awarded would be off-setting. 10)The affidavit evidence was not relevant because the plaintiffs filed a defence and counterclaim and there was no requirement that the defendants reply to it. 11)The letter was not privileged as it contained a description of shortfalls and deficiencies. 12)The plaintiffs merely plead 'failing to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation'. The words'shortfalls and deficiencies' did not add much more. The plaintiffs should be able to describe with some clarity the nature and source of the shortfalls/ deficiencies along with the dollar value of same.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant, Wal-mart Canada Corp., which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant sought an Order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion, the union applied for an order dismissing the applicant's motion. HELD: 1) The relief sought by the Union should be granted. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, it is reasonable to conclude that there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias within the documents. 2) The transcript of the radio broadcast was admissible. There must be nothing more than allegations by plaintiff in pleading the validity of which have not been tested. 3) The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon on May 10, 2006 meet neither requirement. There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is an equal problem. Since everything attributed to the Matkowski family has an aura of self-interest, it does not generate confidence in its reliability. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 4) The affidavits filed by the union do not meet either requirement. They are admissible by reason of s. 7 Saskatchewan Evidence Act Act, S.S. 664, c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the Legislative Assembly, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Queen's Printer shall be deemed to be authentic and make proof of their contents without other evidence. 5) The admissibility of the articles and the transcript of 'John Gormley Live' radio broadcast is not supported by the affidavits. 6) Without any evidence of interference by the Department or interference with the Board, the statements and the presence of certain publications are not admissible to prove the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the articles. 7) The same affidavit was attached to an affidavit of one of the"
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial ÃÂ» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations. He has not shown that he is capable of making rational decisions beneficial to himself. 3) In asking the court to adopt the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness to stand a trial, the respondent was asking this court to follow the test set out in R. v. Taylor (1992), 77 C.C.C.(3d) 551. 4) There are strong interests in an accused being fit to proceed to trial, and the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. In this case, the public interests outweigh the interests of the general public. The respondent was charged with a total of 29 offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. Most of these were summary conviction offences arising out of multiple failures to comply with various bail conditions including: breach of curfew (five charges), failing to attend school, failing to reside in a designated residence, and failing to not possess, keep or consume alcohol (four charges). He was also charged with two indictable offences: two counts of breach of bail conditions and one count of obstruction of a peace officer by providing false name. 5) The Court concludes that the evidence of the Crown and the parties that the appellant is incapable of instructing counsel as he does not have the capacity to interpret the evidence and to present a rational decision. The evidence of a psychiatrist who assessed the respondent as having a high threshold for the ability to instruct counsel derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choice his own self-defence. The psychiatrist concluded that he would therefore be unable to instruct in a manner that would be in his best interests and that he, in fact, resist the assistance of counsel altogether.

The Crown will make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; and (f) the actual notes of the RCMP officer. HELD: The Crown shall make timely and extensive authorities. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. The appellant argued that the sentence should have been increased because the trial judge failed to adequately address the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony. The court referred to R. v. Jacquard, where the Supreme Court held that when faced with the question of whether the appellant and his counsel had been properly instructed in their respective jurisdictions, the jury was properly instructed. In this case, the appellant's testimony at trial was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case and the evidence of the Crown and the defence was also properly addressed."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old male was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for sexual purposes with his hand contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was ordered to provide sufficient samples of his bodily substances so that a DNA analysis could be conducted. In addition to the sentence of incarceration, the Crown applied for s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public spaces frequented by children under 14. The Crown sought s. 718.01 for a lengthy probation period to follow the custodial provision of s. 161 of the code and a mandatory prohibition order from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, ammunition and explosive substance during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order. The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record and he did not previously serve time in jail. The court expects that he will be able to overcome this time."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interestâ to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase 'participating interest in the Program Lands or Project Area' did not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant. 2)The phrase 'offering notice' was deleted to add weight to the proposal. 3)The use of the word 'participation interest' in the context of the original agreement was not substantively relevant to the purpose of creating a new right of first refusal, even if it was a broad definition, which would have been accepted by the majority of the parties. 4)The word 'ownership' as used in s.14.01 to describe the offer to buy the Offered Interest for cash, subject to rights of the Purchasers pursuant to Article XIV (herein called the 'Third Party Offer'), and the cash consideration and other terms on which the sale and purchase is desired to be made by the Vendor to the Third Party were all added upon."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on November 14, 2005. The issue was whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application was dismissed with fixed costs. 1) There were four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act.  2) The statement of claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to ss. 3 and 3. The affidavit of Shirley Scott shows with the required precision the amount of the debt owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be.  3) It is trite law that a plaintiff has a statutory right to garniishee the defendantâs funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or a liquidative demand. 4) Pre-judgments Garnishee is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnihee summons nullity. 5) The affidavit filed by the applicant is a true copy of an invoice dated October 31, 2005 and is of no assistance to the Court in making its decision.  6) The Court has not considered any of the contents of the affidavits filed by either party or statement of defence and counterclaim."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for access to his children at a settlement conference. He alleged that the mother had refused to provide access and communication with his children. The father had been denied access for multiple sclerosis and was now facing the prospect of losing his mobility. He requested that all restrictions on his access be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to driving. The mother objected to the access restrictions and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November 2007. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the fatherâs medical condition and his use of marijuana did not constitute a risk to the children. As long as the children were able to make informed decisions about their health and safety, they would be able to drive safely. The concerns relating to the medical marijuana use and its possible effect on his driving were minor and not serious issues."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that if the Act applied, the contractor would be required to pay directly to suppliers and labourers for All Ports, unless some other party had a prior claim to the holdback fund. In the absence of a contract, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. The supplier's claim was dismissed.

It was submitted on behalf of Hazmasters that the handwritten note contained no such words as explicit promise and that it desisted from immediately pusuing its rights under the Bond constituted sufficient consideration to support the claim to pay."

The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.

It was not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon Securities did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at Sturgis Meats as a result of a circuit breaker at the business being tripped off. The monitoring equipment was in good working order. An employee of the monitoring company was monitoring the signal from Sturgisi Meats and no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, 2010. The issue was whether there was a cause beyond Gardon's control which resulted in no such alarm being received by them so it could be reported to Sturgie Meats. The onus was on the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that the breach of the contract was within their control. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was found to have breached the contract by failing to attend six months of the specified time period to repair the equipment. 2) There was no evidence presented by the plaintiff that any request for repair was ever received from the business after the incident. The detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon ensured that there was no failure of the equipment at the company. 3) The defendant was found not to have provided any proof that the monitoring equipment had failed or was adjusted improperly by someone other than the plaintiff."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying it for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States and is looking to retire in the next few years. The petitioner is on long term disability. She is trying to obtain employment that pays her an annual income of $109,912. HELD: 1) The respondentâs application was dismissed.  2) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay the child support owed. It would not be appropriate to reduce child support based on his actual income over the years. 3) There was no undue hardship. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time and, in some cases, had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 4) There were no special circumstances on which the respondent could have taken employment that paid him $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 5) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse. She was on long-term disability and could not put her children into extracurricular activities.

e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the sender did not take the content of the email as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial in May 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions. Supplementary submissions were made by both parties. The trial judge did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence was more technical than the Crown's submission that the sender sent the email with the intent to get reaction from the student and that the words in issue were part of a computer program. 2)There was no evidence of the sender's intention to kill the student. The evidence raised issues of admissibility of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination, and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that he thought the person he was trying to contact was monitoring the student's typing. 3)The trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant's evidence raised the requisite mens rea for an acquittal, a new trial or conditional discharge on the basis that the trial judge failed to inquire into the senderâs identity or the nature of the e-mail. 4)There were no errors by the Crown with respect to the evidence provided by the respondent. The court found that the evidence was part of the ânarrativeâ and concluded that the Crown had not met the burden of proving the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)It was not open to the court to impose sentence on the appellant for failing to provide sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on these elements."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement.

At the very least, another lawyer should have sat through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. HELD: The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by the Crown's failure to inform the defence that the witness they intended to call would be a Crown witness. A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. The court found that requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate.

If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","FIAT: By order and judgment dated March 29, 2010, the Court of Appeal certified the within action as a class action. The defendants were granted leave to appeal the certification order and all other aspects of the order pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of The Class Actions Act. A number of grounds of appeal were advanced including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause of action. HELD: 1)Leave was granted. Steps were now available to move the matter forward concurrently with the appeal even though there was an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certifying order.

The father appeared at the hearing and objected to service of the hearing notice. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The award was set aside and a new hearing was ordered. The Deputy Rentalsman committed an error in law by denying 10 days notice. The Landlord and Tenant Act s.60(5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served. The day the notice was received and the day of the hearing must be excluded in calculating the notice period (Interpretation Act s.24(4)). In this case the tenant received only 8 days notice. No costs.","When the tenant vacated his rented premises there was a dispute about what constituted proper notice. The landlord applied to the Office of the Rentalsman for determination of the issue. notice of hearing served by registered mail to the tenant's workplace. The tenant's father attended the hearing but was not seeking an adjournment and indicated that the tenant was acting as the landlord's agent only in so far as to argue that the Tenant had not been properly served. The deputy landlord objected to the service of the notice of the hearing and the award of $1,245. HELD: The appeal was allowed; the award was set aside; and a new hearing was ordered. 1)The tenant received only eight days notice. He was entitled to insist on ten days notice and by denying it that period of notice the deputy landlord committed an error in law.  2)Section 60(5.1) of The Residential Tenancies Act does not speak to abridging the time for service and no such authority is to be found elsewhere. 3)The landlord's failure to strictly comply with s.60(1)(a) did not result in a reversible error when the tenant held that the purposes for service had been met. 4)A landlord claim for any other type of order must be served either (a) personally on the tenant(s) at least 10 days prior to the hearing or by Registered Mail and obtaining Delivery Confirmation that clearly shows that the tenants(S) have signed for and accepted the notice. 5)The deputy landlord did not address the subject."
5_2014skca95.txt,"Civil Procedure â Appeal â Leave to AppealLand â Certificate of Pending Litigation The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased. The respondentâs solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queenâs Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queenâs Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband against title to certain lands. His estate was represented by his executors. The applicant had filed a notice of appeal under s.47 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c Q-1.01, but failed to consider whether the order appealed was interlocutory or final in nature. She subsequently filed notice of motion seeking leave to appeal and, with no objection from the respondent, her application proceeded. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a particular in its implications. Given the nature of the impugned order, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudicially upon the course or outcome of the action. 2)The applicant is a party to a class action lawsuit. It is pertinent to note that the proposed appeal is not only of interest to the Court of Queenâs Bench but to the field of practice or the state of the law, or to the administration of justice generally. 3)At its heart, the proposal appeal would involve revisiting an Interlocutory Order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial. However, the draft notice of Appeal is not confined to whether the chambers judge exercised his discretion within the criteria which bear upon the proper exercise of his judicial discretion. Rather, the broadly-framed Draft Notice of Appeal invites the Court to retry matters and, to some extent, reweigh evidence so as to supplant or adduce the chambers judgesâ findings and conclusions."

The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him. During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window. At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge. Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties invited some guests to the apartment for a sociable and convivial evening together. The accused invited the complainant to join them in the basement to participate in the fight club. They stumbled to the floor and struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. His subjective belief that the action of the complainant presented to him an imminent danger of grievous bodily harm and that his counter action was necessary to protect himself was not reasonable. On the whole evidence, the Court concluded that the assault was consensual and that, on the evidence, it was reasonable to conclude that without the bodily harm the accused provoked the assault upon himself."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a Metis youth contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under s. 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The Defence did not oppose the application. HELD: The young person was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and 6 months of community supervision. He was prohibited from possessing firearms, ammunition, knives, or knives outside of his residence. 1) A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court had little confidence that the young person would successfully comply with conditions, if probation alone were imposed, given his history of non-compliance. The accused expressed remorse for the assault, expressed his regret at not being released, and expressed his desire to get help with his problems. 2) The accused was granted credit for time spent in detention on the basis of for 1.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis that the issues raised in this case were exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one in respect of the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon. Each of the issues dealt with were new and relevant to this appeal.  1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskat, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all the other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) The assessment Appeals Committee did not err in concluding that abnormal functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type construction but rather a vintage building when design standards were different and building has seen its day. The present method of assessing the common area is reasonable and meets the definition of 'caused by changes in demand, design and technology which resulted in loss in the utility' by dismissing various suggestions that the underground parkade was functionally obsolete. The proposal to have the food court and mini-golf be common areas or commercial rental space was rejected by the Committee as not meeting the criteria set out in the report. 3) The appeal must be dismissed on the same basis as the other grounds of appeal."

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the city owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At issue was whether an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday(holiday) or whether the City is obliged to pay overtime as required by the Act for hours worked over 32 in a week which has a holiday in it.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. 2) The authorization was set aside as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and a stay of proceedings excluded from trial. 4) The Crown did not err in arguing that evidence tendered at preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. Given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of leave to cross examine should be the preserve of the court judge. The fact that the applicant did not consider this possible is a strong directive to that end. 5) The use of an undercover police officer or police agent is not the general rule. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge. R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. Preliminary inquiry evidence: The Crown obtained an edited copy of the affidavits used to obtain the authorization in the Dosch case. The editing included deletion of all dates on which the police obtained information about a grow operation. The blanks were filled in to verify some of the information he had received from the informant. The balance of this paragraph consisting of sub-clauses (b) to (h) have been edited out. It would appear to be an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing."
9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","The appellants appeal from their conviction of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted the appellants of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellation's use of the word 'hamlet' in reference to the bylaw does not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The bylaws and bylaws of the rural municipality do not reference livestock in the sense of a hamlet since they do not refer to a particular type of livestock. In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. It can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 2)The three bylaws tendered by appellants that were tendered to them in 2006 did not reference cattle. They were in position to peruse the bylaws relating to districts labelled hamlet and learn of the rules governing their property including the rule prohibiting cattle in that zoning district. The second bylaw purports to be an amendment to the rural Municipality's basic planning statement and its relevance to the issues was not apparent. The amendments in this document are not reflected in the version of the zoning bylaw that was put in evidence. 3)In any event, the uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the previous regime no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in district zoned Hamlet. Cement, livestock and other living creatures that might be kept by people, including bees and butterflies, are not allowed in that district. 4)Human error in lawThe trial justice made no errors in law. His findings of fact were supported by the evidence."

Due to the unavailability of this service, the mother had given evidence in Nunaveut and the child had been sent to Nova Scotia to live with her father. There was no change in the circumstances. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his father to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody.  1)The father was to provide the financial and environmental factors.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs, who were associated in the practice of law, filed an application for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs submitted that RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. They alleged damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and breach of the contracts. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC's solicitors in 1990. The Court refused to dismiss the action on the basis that there was an understanding that the matter would proceed until such time as RBC would not acquiesce or allow the plaintiffs' application to have the action dismissed. The solicitors did not represent the plaintiffs. There was no evidence that they consented to the action. The matter did not advance for over 20 months. The delay was entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff's solicitor and the plaintiff himself was blameless. The plaintiff never asked for those particulars. Even allowing for the two-and-a-half year delay, the delay was of some eight years."

In order to protect the best interests of the child, the court must take jurisdiction and set aside the previous order to allow the applicant another disposition review hearing.","The applicant, who was the mother of the child, applied under Rule 37.11(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules to set aside the decision of the Family and Children's Services Commissioner placing the child in the permanent care of the Agency. The applicant had failed to recognize and take control of her alcoholism. Although the applicant had received some oral instructions from the Respondent in regard to the child's situation, she had not received any of the required written instructions. She withdrew from the proceeding without giving any further notice. The Respondent, who had received no further written instructions, applied for a disposition review hearing. Application set aside; the child was in need of long term care and custody; the applicant failed to demonstrate that she failed to appear because of an accident, or his mistake or that there was insufficient notice; and the child had not indicated she was willing to change. The court found that the applicant's personal difficulties, denial, misrepresentations, irresponsibility, poor judgment and decision making all erode her parenting capacity and make her incapable of providing a stable and secure home for the child at present."

6_1999canlii12571.txt,"The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing. He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the conduct of the applicant pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. The Act does not permit the amendment of the Form discipline notice, since it is a statutory form. The relief sought in the motion regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. HELD: 1)The applicant was a member of the Regina Police Service. Pursuant to the Act the applicant was charged with discreditable conduct. He received no notice of the investigation pursuant to s. 54(1) of the Act. He took objection to the prosecutor's request to amend the discipline offence with which he was charged and with the failure by the Chief of the Police to provide notice to Cst. Young of the discipline proceedings as required by the legislation. The hearing officer held that judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate alternative remedy exists, it ought to be available. 2)There was insufficient evidence to determine the merits of the application. The applicant was in good position to deal with that issue as it was a matter for the courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which were relevant.  3)There should be an adequate standard of correctness. The alternative remedies were not adequate. 4)The convenience of the alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review in a discretionary manner could not be accessed. 5)The failure to provide the required statutory notice in the form of a writ of prohibition could result in a different result. 6)The jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Police Commission and the residual discretion in the court will ordinarily be exercised in denial of certiorari. Only if special circumstances present will the courts exercise their prerogative power and quash the certioraris. 7)The court should exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction at this stage to prevent further denial of natural justice. The factors set out in Lamer C.J. at 108-109 set out the factors to be considered in determining whether or not to enter into judicial review. 8)The Supreme Court reviewed the case in Matsqui Indian Band v.

She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. The debts date back 13 years. She made her proposal in 2000 and was no further ahead. Another five years have passed. She completed the Consumer Proposal in 2005 and received a Certificate of Full Performance in April 2005. The proposal was administered by the Government of Nova Scotia through the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Debtor Assistance. She had applied for interest relief in 2005 but was advised that it would discharge in 2010. This proposal was fully performed in 2010 but then became ineffective against the student loans.

The Court reviewed the situation by reference to the Superintendent's Standards under Directive No. 11R2 Surplus Income. Understand she has surplus income of $800 per month. Now with the amendments the court would have no difficulty in requiring her to pay a significant portion of the debt, say half of it, because any period longer would be too long. It would also protract the burden of these loans in manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. The second issue is to be dealt with by 'Laporte inventory'. HELD: 1) The accused is entitled to hard copies of all documents filed by the defence. There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been written in a reasonably accessible manner and does not detract from the ability of the defence to make an argument on the issue of trial fairness.  2) The disclosure provided is reasonably accessible. It is appropriate to have the disclosure be provided in a usable format. In this case, the issue is whether the Crown and the defence have an obligation for disclosure in general terms in a slightly different fashion. The question is not whether the disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, combination of the two. However, the choice is theirs, so long as the disclosure is reasonable accessible. The court is able to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order, if any, regarding further disclosure, or should that issue be left to the trial judge. 3) The format of disclosure provided by the Crown in this case is appropriate. There are some 30,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence in addition to 275 audio files, 50 video files and large series of photos. The Crown does not object to the existence of hard copies. The issue that has arisen in other cases (R. v. Jonsson), [2001] W.W.R. 325, Klebuc J. (as he then was) stated: 'Whether production on computer diskettes or CD-ROM's is adequate will vary with the sophistication of the accused and his or her counsel's ability to access data stored thereon.'

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence had a serious personal injury offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. There were also 10 convictions on it for violent offences, six of which related to peace officers. In addition, the accused had violated his mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and been recommitted to the Penitentiary and breached a conditional sentence order once. The crimes of violence for which the accused has been convicted include the assault of a police officer which occurred when he was cornered by two officers and a large tree branch which was about seven feet long and three-quarters to two inches in diameter. The police officer fired his taser at the accused, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. At paragraph 41 of the judgment, the Crown referred to R. v. Ponticorvo, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII), in which the Court held that a penitentiary sentence is warranted given the accused's record, his violent conduct, his record, the offences of violence against the peace officer and his repeated breaches of mandatory supervision and breaches of his parole. In this case, it was the accused who displayed such indifference that the Court concluded that the accused was 'within the realm of possibility or beyond it'."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After he determined the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The subsequent breathalyzer certificate was excluded from the evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. The evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the learned judge has concluded that the case is almost directly on all fours with Prosper. The Crown has not proven that the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. 2) On the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction to hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee until a reasonable opportunity to reach counsel has been provided to him/her, the Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown has met the burden of establishing that the Respondents right to a free, preliminary legal advice is not abusively waived. 3) The holding-off requirement on police in this case flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded that a warning was required to the respondent after he asserted the right to counsel and the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 4) The Certificate of Analysis was excluded."

The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court does not know who to believe, and he is not convicted of this offence contrary to ss.267 of the Code. In assessing credibility, the Court is guided by the principles restated in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1996), 141 Sask. R. 221 (Sask. C.A.) and the Defence Principles. The accused bears no onus whatsoever in the determination of credibility. The Crown must prove that its evidence is credible. Even if the Court prefers to have the Crown's evidence, it must still consider if the evidence for the defence raises a reasonable question. The credibility of material witnesses needs to be considered, in that context."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife, who needed the vehicle as transportation for herself and her children, sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. Certificates of ownership are important as property. However, ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. Once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. The Credit Union's claim was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of the wife."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitionerâs concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitionerâs opinion evidence regarding the respondentâs alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitionerâs evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitionerâs allegation of the respondentâs anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the childrenâs best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, which the Court could not reasonably attribute to the respondent. The Court found with respect to the totality of the evidence that: 1) the respondent was significantly involved in his children's lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments; 2) the petitioner was entirely entitled to rebut the presumption that increased contact between the parties would in fact be beneficial. The evidence supported the conclusion the respondent would not be able to support such an application given the circumstances; and 3) that there was an artificial set of circumstances that would militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship. The petitioner's grounds for so applying stated that he was scratching not masturbating and that he had been unable to avoid contact with the children for the past two years. The father had previously been diagnosed as being addicted to pornography, but now denied having ever masturbated in the presence of his children; and 4) that his anger management issues had made it difficult for him to put the children to bed with the exception of brief periods of uninterrupted daytime access. The court concluded that the evidence did not support the respondent's conclusion that he would be unable to protect the children from the risk associated with unsupervised access. Therefore, the Court refused to impose a minimum supervision access order on the father."

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that they would pay $3,000 per month plus support for their son Michael and their daughter Karin. Since then the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,500 per month and even those have been irregular and not on time. The husband is currently suspended with pay. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was the uncertainty of the husband's future job and income, the uncertainty as to what he will require if he does decide to enter the workforce this fall. Also, there were uncertain prospects for the wife's future employment. 2)The respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $ 1,000 without at least consulting with the wife. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received in April and in April. 3)The petitioner had been paid $3000.00 per month since December 1994. She claimed she had received only a total of $ 3,000. None of the allegations were refuted. The respondent was entitled to vary the maintenance he was paid in relation to the number of months he was paying. 4)The Court allowed the petitioner to have her costs of the matrimonial home sold and the net proceeds from the sale of the home to be distributed to the spouses. 5)The court allowed the respondent to unilaterally trim the respondent's maintenance he had paid up until December 1995 by an amount not in the amount sought. 6)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of spouse maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There are too numerous unknown factors including the future status of the spouse whose future employment is uncertain. There is no evidence that she will require a return to her previous income. The Court was of the opinion that this was an interim application."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","The applicants apply in this Court for a motion to convert the debentures held by the Respondent, Medusa Medical Technologies Incorporated, into an action. The application alleges that the respondent's conduct has caused it to suffer damages and that it wants to counterclaim against the respondent and Bough. The Respondent has commenced a separate action for damages against the applicants. At issue is whether the application can be converted to an action and if so, whether the presumptions in favour of the application must carry the day. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(4) provides a number of factors which can go a long way to making future events more predictable and more certain. 2) The applicant can be expected to be ready to be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the applicant's enforcement application. Medusa has failed to meet its burden of proving such a proposition on a balance of probabilities. 3) The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by the parties and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties. 4) Each party shall have their costs on this motion on a party and party basis."

The learned judge misconstrued the situation. Accepting the recommendation of both the Crown and the defence, that there be a conditional discharge, 3 years probation, absolutely no contact direct or indirect with the named victim and no contact with the accused during the specific that allows for further discharge, the sentence is reasonable and the accused will not violate the order that was made."

Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The applications to the Board were made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, many issues including the use of a transcript and the question of current status and degree of review were raised. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order for vote held as premature. 1)There was no evidence that any of the steps had occurred at the time of the hearing. 2)The standard of review suggested that the labour Relations Board and the Chamber judge both focused on facts they found to be significant. More fundamentally, however, each had in mind an interpretation of s.37. An analysis of the facts is impossible without deciding what the superstructure, that is, the meaning of s37, is. 3)The Board was not prepared to limit itself to indicia of transfer of title or assets of nature which might be more pertinent in the context of, for example, financing arrangements, insurance contracts or other such matters. 4)The fundamental question was whether the Board's interpretation was patently unreasonable. 5)The evidence suggesting otherwise was not accepted. 6)The Court was of the view that the fundamental question which should have been addressed by the chamber judge was whether he could have been asked more simply was that the issues raised by the transcript did not exist. The transcript was not used and the definition of 'patently unreasonable' was not raised except in the opinion of the Court of Appeal. 7)It was not appropriate to jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on different interpretation."
7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT. The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim was with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as a person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by counsel that they wish to do so that the struck or dissolved corporation should be allowed to file her affidavit in support of its case. Alternatively, if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file its affidavit, it should make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit. HELD: The Court held that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness, the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed, as if it was a registered entity in Saskatchewan and it would be entitled to defend an action initiated against it before its dissolution. In this case, the dissolved corporate defendant corporation represented its former president and sole director and shareholder, Orion Morgan. Accordingly, the plaintiffs wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed on its behalf. The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court. The procedure will be implemented during September 2012."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. It was owned by the defendants and their realtor, who was hired by the plaintiff to advise her that there had been a problem with the skylight in the house and that she could not realistically afford to buy the home. The defendant, who had recently purchased a new home, also misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, namely that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site, in so doing, it is alleged that they breached the terms of the contract between them. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in her home.  1) The evidence from the realtor was that the house had been heated by wood, which caused cracks in the eaves, peepholes in the attic and a gas line onto the property. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences.  2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The realtor looked at nothing in particular since the rural municipality had not done any such inspections prior to 2000. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park did not inspect the property and did not provide a copy of the building permit. 3) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition in the contract for sale. The offer was made at the expense of the plaintiff. The husband was not the only one buying the property at the time. The wife was the primary caretaker of the home during the construction of the house. She was involved in the preparation of the PCDS and in the execution of the inspection. 4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000,000 for each year that she paid for the home, and that the husband was to pay $250,000 to have the home delivered. The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement for a further 50 years. The parties were also entitled to solicitor-client costs. 5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext."

On March 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""). In April 1999, SPMC filed notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of their claim with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendant company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of the Labour Standards Act.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The defendant, STC, admitted to dismissing the plaintiff without cause or notice in breach of its contract of service with him. In consequence the plaintiff obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles (the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law. Was this error? Even if it were, and it was, it was not in substance at least, too much can be made of it. The severance terms of the plaintiff's contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service with the company and were accordingly attributed to him for the purpose of mitigating his loss."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by a judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown argued that the warrant was quashed in error and that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the decision. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard of review set out in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search warrant and in determining that the evidence contained in the information to be unproven and not sufficient to conclude that the issuing justice could have issued the warrant. Further, the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and, in the result, the result would not necessarily have been the same."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture on the basis that her interest in the Lincoln was not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was not the same as that of the automobile. 2)The automobile was not intended to be used as a 'offence-related property' but rather as a conveyance that was used to facilitate the commission of a designated substance offence. 3)The Lincoln was owned and operated by the same person for 14 years. 4)Section 20(4) prescribes the powers of the court upon the hearing of an application for forfeiture. The court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish and punish. 5)The test for determining whether a sentence is disproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter. 6)Section 19(3) provides the authority for the court to make an order of relief from forfeiting.

There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000.  1) The evidence was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding the child was a dependent child pursuant to s. 2(c) of the Act and in ordering maintenance. 2) There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and therefore depart from it. He did not err.  3) The order for support was not premised on the child's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. He was taking a hiatus from work to pursue his studies. It was not his intention to work permanently. The child had not withdrawn from the charge of his parents."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and that they should be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that the respondent pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. In this case, the applicant argued that the collective agreement which provided the respondent agreed to reinstate him as a full time member of the faculty did not apply to him. Dismissing the application, that (1) the Charter does not apply; (2) the respondent is a creature of statute, not designated as an agency of the Crown and (3) an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Childrenâs Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. The father takes the position that it would be in the childrenâs best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Childrenâï¿½s Law Act, 1997. It is only if grant the grandmother the appropriate status that she can apply for custody. The grandparentsâ relationship with the children was not fostered by the father. 2) The father was granted supervised access to the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. He was to have supervised access for the children. 3) The partiesâ children were to reside primarily with the grandmother. There was no evidence that the father was unable or unwilling to pay child support for the two boys. 4) The grandmother was to provide the father with parenting time. 5) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the âsufficient interestâ question, in the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child, was the nature and relationship of the child. The nature and intensity of the relationships between the parties and their best interests did not enter the analysis at that point. The evidence from the grandmother was insufficient to determine whether the father could show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the baby. The court could have served an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had prior knowledge that he was a victim of a motor vehicle accident and that his benefits were terminated because he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI's termination of benefits was appropriate and the plaintiff was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident resulted in his suffering of soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine and resulting conduct on October 1 and thereafter.  2)The plaintiff's benefits under the Personal Injury Protection Plan were terminated as a result of the accident. 3)Sawkiw's benefits were to be re- terminated. SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. 4)If the plaintiff is found to have a relapse under s.142(1)(a), the court found that under the terms of this judgment, SGI expected the plaintiff to participate in daily physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial income replacement benefit. 5)Swingkiw was to be entitled to interest on such an amount as should have been paid."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application was opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. Allowing the application, that the learned Chambers judge erred in law when he ruled that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for cost. The amendment will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. The arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it. There is no suggestion of any prejudice in that sense resulting from the amendment."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant ÃÂ» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years.  1) The defendant did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity. He had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in Latin course. He used the university computers to engage in the activities. 2) There were no barriers put in place to restrict distribution of the product. The fact that the defendant had not accessed the internet since he was arrested was not a mitigating factor. Denunciation and deterring others who might be inclined to engage the activity of distributing child porn requires a long term incarceration. A conditional sentence would not bestrong enough in the circumstances to deter others, who might come to the accused's attention if he were incarcerated. 3) There was no evidence to support the conditional sentence as the defendant was not an appropriate candidate for programming."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant held a hearing in Small Claims Court on behalf of the claimants. During that hearing, the judge refused to issue summons to the defendant and issued a Supplementary Interim Ruling, which ordered that the defendant should be given an opportunity to argue the issues identified. The applicant then submitted 18 Claims for issuing by the defendant. The defendant was solicitor for all of the proposed plaintiffs and after some careful reflection and consultation with administrative personnel within the court, issued the Interim Rule. The Court reviewed the letter when it was absent from the court and was satisfied the judge had not voiced his opinion about the speed at which the matter was being considered. The court found that the summonses were not being issued because the defendant had not provided notice to the other potential parties. Therefore, the court declined to issue the summons. The application for declaratory relief was dismissed."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996.

In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The husband was 52 years old and unemployed. He qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. The petitioner alone provided for the three children. In the circumstances, it should not take the form of spousal support. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should take form of maintenance.  1)The claim for relief was grounded in the fact that the respondent was the registered owner of the farm land and received the entire rental. The difference in value relates to a section of land which was one quarter of which contained the matrimonial home. 2)The petitioner attributes $2,292.58 to the children. If one refers to that sum in The Federal Child Support Guidelines the related income exceeds $150,000. The actual amount is $210 which is 33% of the respondent's income of $630. 3)There is no requirement that the husband live in a group home and there is no basis upon which can order or even expect such. The children are adequately provided for. As to luxurious living, the petitioner had the means to pay $500. 4)The court found that there was a sufficient total of means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and the respondent to enjoy an improved standard.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accusedâs actions were done in self-defence. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life.

The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample as in the opinion of Cst.

The police officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details. 3)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s 254(5)of the Code consists of intentional non-compliance.
