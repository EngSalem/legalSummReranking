The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office and continued to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The notice of extension had expired on the expiry of 150 days from the date of its service. The limitation period had substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention and it expired within the day. The applicant was awarded the taxable costs of her application against the respondent. As the respondent had failed to initiate any action, the application for an order under s. 11(1) had been suspended."

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.",The applicant sought approval of the court for a settlement of a crush injury to the right leg below the knee which had occurred when the bus pulled away from the school bus carrying the infant. The medical reports on file indicated that there was no evidence that the infant's injuries would cause any permanent discomfort or disability. The wording in Rule 63.19(1) requires that the filing of the Agreement with the Prothonotary is mandatory because of the use of the word'shall'. This was not done in this case. As the Agreement does not comply with Rule 63.(1) and thus under s. 2 of rule 63(19) the solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of any contingency arrangement and without regard to the contingency. This means the Contingency Fee Agreement is out. The rules with regard to Contingencies Fee Agreements as set out must be adhered to.
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and Control, the trial judge considered whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 2) The trial judge reviewed the relevant factors and found that the appellant was definitely in actual care or control. The only thing the accused added to viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. 3) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant was fined $250.00 and had to appear in the Baddeck Hospital for a complete stop. On the appeal of her conviction, the appellant took the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. Appeal dismissed; the evidence was found to be so unreliable as to be unreasonable."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and was actively involved in the referendum process. He was a member of the Students' Union during the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. He had been a prominent figure in the debate process and participated in the decision of the Elections Board. The Chambers judge found that, even if he had standing, he was not entitled to the relief granted by the judge."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and the Crown was alleging the existence of signs of impairment and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the impaired charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial judge found that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The conditional stay was set aside and either an acquittal or a new trial ordered by virtue of alleged error of law."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. Husky appealed. The issue raised was the interpretation adopted by the board of the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(b) of the Education and Health Tax Act. If, as the board found, the purchase of the drawings was an independenttransaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1(f)) of the Act? 1) The evidence before the board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase than documentation charges. 2) The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to asDocumentation charges. 3) On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. 4) The Court could look to administrative policy as a factor which may be considered in cases of doubt about the meaning of legislation. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Section 22 of the Revenue and Financial Services Act requires that findings of fact made by the Board are to be accepted and applied in any judicial review of the decision. It is of no consequence but might say find no difficulty in accepting the Board's conclusion on this important factual determination."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment. The accused was found guilty of assault contrary to ss. 267(1)(a) of the Code. A Provincial Court judge found him guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in both ways. The appellant's reasons do not reflect an inconsistency with respect to the first issue and the reasonableness of the accused's belief that he was being threatened. The trial judge tested the evidence against what the accused actually did and found that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate. The Appeal judge found that although the accused had been prepared for an altercation and was afraid that there was going to be a fight, the Trial judge did not address the officer's assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing and the officer focused on the fact there were two officers present."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. The tribunal also failed to take into account the fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy. 2) CUPE denied any discrimination on the basis of his disability. 3) The tribunal denied any inference from the Commission's findings as to the circumstances of the applicant's disability. The fact that this disability was only a factor in his decision to seek permanent employment with the City denied any discriminatory treatment. The applicant had demonstrated that his job as a casual employee was to primarily hauling materials with an eight-ton tandem truck. The City administration and CUPe were both pleased by his work and believed that he had a disability which made his decision reasonably and reasonably reasonable. 4) The applicant was awarded $8,902.00 as damages."

The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police. When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and possession of a weapon after he returned to the porch in a state of drunkenness to find the complainant lying on the pew with his head injury and a piece of iron rebar being used to strike the complainant in the head. The police had investigated the scene of the assault and had found the accused in need of medical attention. He was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. The accused was asked if he wanted to call a lawyer prior to making any statement to the police. He answered that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day and that he had the right to counsel now. The officer who interviewed the accused said he was concerned that he did not understand his rights, and that the accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. HELD: The accused's question, 'Is he dead or is he still inebriated?', was not the subject of the police's inquiry. It was a matter of fact that the police officers were aware that the complainant had a memory of the events that day but they did not ask him if he wished to have legal counsel. He remained focused on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement, and on the more serious charges, such as being in breach of his s.10(b) rights. Access to counsel is the gateway of the Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. The Crown sought admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. It would be egregious to allow admission of this statement into the evidence. The entire case rests on three statements made by the accused during the course of the detention, first on s. 87 Liquor Control Act violation for public drunkenness and then on the most serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the complainant as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. The defence submitted that this response exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding by the officer of his basic constitutional rights under s. 10(b). The police would have been aware of the misunderstanding and as result, were required to clear up any misunderstanding the detainee may have exhibited about his rights. This could have been achieved by asking the question: 'Is the complainant dead?', followed by a 'Do you wish to call lawyer?' The accused remained focused in the present moment and did not make any decision"

The Ritaline did not have the desired effect and the child was referred to a psychiatrist. Both the petitioner and the respondent now decided it would be in the best interests for the child, now aged 10 years, to be moved from Eastend to live with his father and common law wife in Edmonton. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice."
4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. A consent order giving effect to the vesting order provided that the university would receive a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in the order. The pension plan arrangement was tontine. The 65 year old expected to outlive his former wife and on her death he expected thereby to regain the then remainder of the pension asset. The parties applied for a further clarification of their intentions. The court prefers to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order and consequential declarations and directions. Paragraph 14(a) provides that the wife is to receive 'a vested interest' in the retirement pension to an extent described by the order of June 30, 1993 which is the maximum amount of pension payable. The wife would like to receive her vested interest as a lump sum benefit. HELD: The court fixed the costs at $300. 1)The wife was to deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the respondent. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal.  2)The order of December 19, 1985 did not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly the 40% share, having vested in the wife, is a share she may deal with with without the reference to or the consentof, the applicant. 3)The court found that the parties had not reconciled their intentions regarding the division of the University of Regina pension plan. It ordered that: (a) the 40 per cent share, which had vested the wife in the university pension plan, was a share available to her for the life with a guaranteed period of 15 years.  4)The 40% limit on lump sum payments was removed pursuant to clause 14(b) of the Order of June 1993. The university was to make monthly payments to the wife of 40% of the total pension payment. The 40 per Cent share had been vested since June 1993 and the specific intent was to encourage the respondent to continue in his employment until at least age 60."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. She sought a rescission of the order in question on the authority of the Family Court on Rule 1.04 of the Rules. The Family Court upheld the appeal without costs. Chipman, J.A. and Pugsley, JJ.A., concurring. The procedure adopted was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed her friend's vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at that time regarding the contact point between the driver's vehicle and the oncoming vehicle. HELD: The Court held that the trial evidence was inadequate and the expert evidence of extrapolation had no probative value. The Court found that where the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the degree of impairment is marked."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, who did not appear at trial and entered a defence of his claim for damages and equity in the amount of $63,267.49. At issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against the defendant was not proven and the portion of the claim was also dismissed. The defendant had to pay costs. 1)The actions taken by both parties were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor Hyndman benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. 2)The facts did not satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)Costs. Although there was no specific contract with respect the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard. As a result, the plaintiff was awarded taxable costs."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal and damages for breach of contract and insubordination. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year. His position as guidance counsellor was always uncertain. He taught upgrading and university entrance courses and supervised other teaching and support staff. Relations between the board members and the plaintiff were not good. He felt that board members were intruding too much into administrative matters, focusing on policy decisions, making demands that were difficult to comply with and he displayed a negative attitude toward the Board of Directors. He suffered damages for this and other complaints. He sought punitive or aggravated damages.  2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff's contract with the Chief and Band Council was indefinite. It was more likely that the member of the Band Council created a working environment that made it impossible for him to perform his duties to their satisfaction. It could not be concluded that the members of the band council actively participated in the disruption of the work place or that they actively contributed to the disruption. It is impossible to conclude that the Board acted in the best interests of the plaintiff and that they did not act in a reasonable manner in accord with the terms of the contract. 3)Just cause is not altogether a term of art. In general, it refers to that degree of misconduct or incompetence which warrants stiff reprisal as opposed to some lesser sanction such as a warning, reprimand or remediation. There is evidence to support the conclusion that the Court found that the respondent was insubordinate in not responding to the board's demands. The Court did not find that the failure of the Board to comply was sufficient to justify dismissal."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is $29,983 and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn. The Court will deal with these issues on a year-by-year basis. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned through the partnership. These expenses are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There is nothing to suggest the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. In 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income was $28,963 and the respondent was in a small credit position which he could offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. 3) The Court was not prepared to add back any of the respondent's personal expenses to this date. The analysis of add-back becomes appropriate only to the extent of $50. The father will be in a very small position but can offset against the capital cost allowance. The adjustment can be made when the issue was finally determined. Assuming that the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered, he will be able to offset the full amount claimed for capital cost allowances but in an amount no higher than $40 per month to not cause any financial hardship upon the children when arrears occur. When arrear occurs, this Court often allows those arrenars to be paid monthly. 4) The father shall pay the petitioner $568 per month for support of the Knudson children commencing October 1, 2005 and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  5) The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income for child support purposes is a three-year average under s17 of the Guidelines.

1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawolina as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial judge on the matter of costs. 3)The judge ordered the defendant to pay solicitor/custodial costs taxed forthwith. Even with Siemens substantially unsuccessful at trial, the defendant's costs should be left to the discretion of the trial court judge."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is granted. The court has declined its jurisdiction to grant a remedy on the application guised as a habas corpus application. The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. The applicant has remained assessed as a minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security RiverBend Institution. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. Although the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habres corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Thus, the court has concluded that it must decline its jurisdiction in granting a remedy based on the basis of habaas corpus. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. While the applicants may have followed a grievance process, it is obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants's physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. The application was preliminary and the applicants had not followed the Offender Complaint and Grievance System as it was the established process for offenders' redress when they felt they had been treated unfairly, or in a manner that was not consistent with Correctional Service legislation and policies."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The agreement stipulated that the husband would be solely responsible for the overdraft and loan, the loan was to be paid on an equal division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, and that the wife would retain the automobile and pension with respect to her mother. The judge found that this was not an unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent agreement and set aside the agreement. The court found that in determining the equity, the judge had failed to take into account the almost inevitable costs of disposition. Matrimonial home divided equally. The husband was to pay monthly maintenance of $600.00 and the wife $1,000.00 per month. The value of the mortgage, RRSP and insurance policies were to be set aside as a result of the separation agreement. Property divided equally by the parties' common assets. The wife's application for an order setting aside the separation Agreement was dismissed. The Court ordered that the maintenance be increased to $2,055.68 and the husband's annual maintenance of about $60,000 be paid in installments of $500 each month. Matrionial home valued in the amount of $61,000 with the table of contents showing the value of each home divided by the sum of $60.00 divided by one common law asset. Matrononial home assessed at $65,000, with the net value at the time of separation reduced to $400 due to unforeseen circumstances.

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable the issue will finally put an ending to the proceedings.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the difference between what the husband would have paid to the wife and her income and a decline in her income. The former wife operated her own business and earned negligible income. She asked the court to vary because of the significant discrepancies between their income and their shared custody arrangement. The applicant argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support, as her contribution to child support purposes was modest and there was no reason to decrease it. The respondent sought to have the payments based on his net income of $115,874 versus $1,286.28 for the wife's income and spousal support, and to review the amount of child support paid by the husband with respect to his RRSP Income. HELD: 1) The applicant's line 150 total income was $14,042.28 including UCCB of $700, spousals of $400 and professional fees of $515. The amount of support payable by the parties was adjusted to reflect the income of each party. 2) There were no discernible changes in the circumstances since the last variation order. Changes in the respondent's income, particularly in the past four years, did not prevent her from exercising her right to vary based on her level of income. There was no evidence she had intentionally failed to obtain a reasonable level of employment income. 3) The respondent's contributions to the children's financial support are modest and no reason is given for the Court to reduce it."

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and possession of fish except in accordance with s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s27 of the act. The accused was convicted of unlawfully angling in excess of the legal limit of 35 hours. The fishing licence was issued in June 2009, issued in September 2009 and is valid for five years. In September 2013, the accused applied for and obtained a fishing licence. He did not have a valid s. 15 licence or a previous fishing licence, nor did he serve a registered letter to the Minister of Environment. The letter addressed to the accused purporting to revoke his licence and prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence was signed by an unknown person. It is not a collateral attack on a ministerial order, valid on its face, having been made without authority, and is not saved by s. of the Charter. There is no prohibition in effect under s. 27 of the FISH Act. The Court found that s. 23(1)(j) of The Interpretation Act is unconstitutional in that it creates a reverse onus, infringing the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and isn't saved by section of the charter. The prohibition in place was in response to a conviction under s13(4) ofthe Fisheries Regulations (Saskatchewan), 1994. The Crown has conceded that the accused is not an Executive Council member. The issue is whether the accused has met it through the Crown’s evidence."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of a weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. HELD: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed but that it was weapon as defined in the Code and that the appellant intended to use it for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. 2)The Crown had not proven the essential intent element of the offence. The appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti, in January 2007. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for variation of the maintenance in September 2006. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The mother's poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set at 1). 2) The father was found to have paid child support in the amount of $3,644.00 per month for two years. The daughter's response to the father by September 2006 was that she had withdrawn from the charge of parent. She did not reply to his subsequent e-mails or phone calls. 3) There was no agreement in 1997 between the parties to pay specified or other maintenance. There was a period of relatively consistent contact between the father, the daughter and the father. The mother was unable to provide for herself or withdraw herself from the responsibility of caring for the daughters. The evidence did not show that she unilaterally withdrew from the relationship with her father. She nevertheless made an attempt thereafter to reconnect without asking for money."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc. in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and associated Equipment. Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it ceased to pay invoices as they became due. Eventually the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invosices and the defendant denied it. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $10,902.32. While the defendant offered oral evidence that it could charge a minimum of three hours for a job that took less time, or that there was a specific charge for miscellaneous parts that exceeded a fair and reasonable price, none of these invoiced results as a result of the higher rate of charge. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant's evidence of cost/effort relationship could be considered as an adequate basis for an objective assessment of the possible industry standard of $85.00 per hour."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant town in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during the construction of a sewage treatment lagoon. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that there had not been any notice of intent to proceed filed prior to the default. The applicant argued that the plaintiff should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment, that there was no authority to sign the order for default, and that there should be a fairly arguable defence to it. Application granted; the defendant had 10 days to file its defence. Although the prothonotary's filing system was automated, the failure to file the affidavit did not appear to be a mere technicality; the plaintiff was entitled to her 'throw away' costs of obtaining the default order."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. He had assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he earned $18,974 per month on average, which he attributed to financing from the bank. The trustee opposed his discharge on multiple grounds, including his intentional failure to provide proper documentation to the trustee and raising questions about surplus income obligations. The bankrupt was 42 years old and claimed to have been insolvent since 2002. He purchased cattle for $1,000 per month prior to bankruptcy but can only sell them now for $200. He claims to have had one son from a previous relationship who does not currently reside with him. He admits to farming cattle in lieu of cash as a means of retiring debts owed to them. He argues that he has been economically and emotionally bankrupt for the past 5 years. He also asserts a security interest over the equity pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act s.173(2)(f). The court found that the bankrupt should be able to comply with the conditional order in the amount of $8,000 in addition to surplus income. The court distinguished between the two on the basis of the fact that it would be unfair and unjust to allow the bankrupt to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors, and the other on the principle that bankruptcy is intended to assist the 'honest but unfortunate debtor' and not to be a 'lifestyle' choice. The multiple s. 173 grounds, his total disregard and disrespect for the process, his failure to produce books and records, his abusive nature collectively and more accurately depict him as neither honest nor unfortunate. The bankruptcy judge was unable to grant the bankrupt an absolute discharge because of several grounds of objection, including the fact he failed to comply in the manner prescribed by the Act and his repeated attempts to evade the court's inspection duties."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. In this case, the chambers judge granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share of six extracurricular activities which the respondent had requested in her variation application. The appellant also requested an order for retroactive child support and determination of the eligible expenses and proportionate shares of s.7 expenses. The respondent applied for specified changes in the parenting arrangement. The issue on appeal was whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these to be extraordinary expenses. However, he must have found that one-half (i.e., five) of the children's activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 2) The appellant's expenses are ordinary and are covered by the basic child support order of $3,542 per year, which he receives tax free. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the judge."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products were priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. The importance of a wage rise, retroactive, would seem to be prejudicial. 3) The Court did not find that the errors made here were so severe as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the Courts. The motion failed."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s. 490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years.

HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s.490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not demonstrably unfit. The Court found that the sentence was neither demonstrably harsh nor unreasonably fit. It was also within the range of what is required under the Criminal Code for a convicted public welfare offender to be fined. The maximum fine for placing elk in danger and obstructing inspection is $750,000 and the total sentence was $6900, which was both appropriate and fit. The appeal court did not find that the overall sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' on the Oppositely, it was neither appropriate nor fit."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. The average work week was 34.75 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the respondent's gross yearly employment income at the time of the accident is much lower than that used for employment insurance benefits. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which the IRBT is derived. 4) The Court accepts Cowan's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the child have been resolved. The child's relationship with his natural father (Mr. Hanna) was diminished before and during the marriage by Ms. Callahan's decision to allow Mr. Hanna back into the child's life. This was an important decision. The words of an Act are'stand in the place of parent' when this decision was made. HELD: 1) The threshold for parental status is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the natural parental role. 2) The Court was not concerned with the costs of the separation but rather with the benefits of a separation."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.

The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. HELD: The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. The defendants may require their own medical examinations by request to the plaintiff or court.  1) There is substantive and legitimate purpose served by the defendants' request for better and current particulars and disclosure of documents. 2) The defendants must know, with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiff, DD, the extent of her injuries, whether there will be chronic disability or whether there is a chronic disability. 3) There are legitimate reasons for the delay. The plaintiffs need more particulars in order to prepare for discovery. In 2010 and in anticipation of discoveries, or with the benefit of healing, passage of Time and the acquired certainty of the plaintiffs injury claim, all factors necessitate granting the defendants's requests for particulars. 4) The plaintiffs should be able to provide the disclosure within 40 days of the granting of this order. 5) The plaintiff and her counsel collectively voiced their frustration with the defendants and their counsel.

5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent father pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses should be retroactive given the child's limited income; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements set out in s.7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act. The respondent father was ordered to pay $1,500 as child support plus costs of $100 for the dance program he was taking part in and $293 for the music program which was his proportionate share of the total cost. The petitioner's expenses were to be paid by the respondent in equal monthly instalments to $100 and they would be paid within 10 days of receiving such receipts. HELD: The Court held that the s. seven expenses did not qualify as extraordinary. 1) The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he had a limited income of $793.09 per month at the time of trial. It was clear from the respondent's financial disclosure that these expenses were incurred by the parties. They did not raise the issue through the court. The Court found that retroactive child support orders should not be given as a matter of course. There must be some justification for such orders. 2) Retroactive support was not warranted based on the table as a whole. It is clear from his financial disclosure statements that he is aware of his obligation to provide support to his granddaughter and that negotiations have been ongoing for some time. The negotiations have not resulted in an order retroactive to August 2000. 3) There was no blameworthy conduct on the part of the respondent as he did not disclose his tax returns to the Court. In fact, the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the parties and child, and accordingly are not warranted."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT.

The vesting orders applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell the property. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted. HELD: The application for the vesting ordered applied for is granted and the form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue.  1)The jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new Land Titling Facilitation Regulations, 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998. The Land Title Conversion Facilitation regulations, R.R.S. 1, and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting Orders is reintroduced by the Land Tiling Facilitation Regulators. It provides that the court has jurisdiction to issue a vestencing order in certain circumstances. 2)The application for vesting ordering applied for was granted. The form of draft order was granted as requested. 3)Application for the application granted. Based upon the submissions from counsel, the Court was satisfied that the jurisdiction was the same as that provided in s. 109 of the new Act. The applicant brought an application to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 27 of the Clarkson case. The Court raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction and neither HSBC nor the trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. Counsel requested the opportunity to address the concerns raised and to make supplementary submission in support of its application which has now been done. 4)Application granted in all circumstances.  5)The Court reviewed the decision in the Clarkson estate and Clarkson case and found that the current circumstances did not have appropriate or appropriate circumstances to grant a vestinge order.  6)The Land Titlest Facilitation Act, 2000 was not used in this case."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were in joint custody of the children. Their access was largely divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Their primary motivation was to relocate to Alberta to marry a different person. They had been in a common law relationship since 1987 and had been living in a duplex that had been converted to a one-story house. The father had recently moved from the province to Alberta and was working and living with his new girlfriend. The parties were unable to effectively co-parent. The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for the children now was stability. That stability was found in their father's home. The children bonded to their mother."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of the employee when he entered a grain terminal, where he was engulfed in grain and died of suffocation. The employee was employed at the time of the incident as a contractor for the grain terminal. Prior to being employed, he was responsible for preparing and transporting grain to the terminal. In the course of repair to a large fan, an employee was injured by the moving fan blade. He was then required to look into the receiving pit to see if there was any product in there, which there was not. He also underwent some training and education on how to unplug a receiving pit and how to properly supervise and train the employee. In his written statement, the employee states that he was not aware of any known or foreseeable health or safety hazard. HELD: The employee is guilty of failing to supervise, train and supervise the employee and is fined $10,000 for failing to make the safety procedures in the field available to the employer. The offence is dismissed. 1) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the Safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the employee suffered a serious injury is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his health and well-being. Not everything that he related can be accurate and have no way of knowing which parts are accurate and which parts aren't. This is part of the reason the Crown characterizes the information about confined space entry as having been buried in hundreds of power point slides. 2) The actus reus that the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, is that the necessary information about the hazards would have been lost on the employee because it would have buried in the mass of other information. It is true that there were many photos, drawings and words in the material. However, the Court cannot be confident that the information is accurate or that the employer exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The Court does not accept the Crown's position that proof of worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus de reus of failing. The employer shall provide education to the employee whenever new hazard information becomes available to them and shortly before the employee is assigned a new activity or exposed to a new hazard. 3) The Court is unsure about the accuracy and reliability of the officer's evidence. It cannot be sure that the officer adequately instructed, trained, supervised and informed he would not have entered the receiving Pit without following safety procedures, which failure directly resulted in the death of the"
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The plaintiff now claimed damages for injuries they suffered as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved. The defendant motion for summary judgement was granted. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied and the defendant was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by the plaintiff, Maria Johansson? The motion was granted and the claims of both Steven and Johansson were dismissed."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development connected with a community facility. The proposed hotel would be located in close proximity to the Evergreen Centre and would be free of charge to the public. The applicant sought a stay in place from further considering the application for a discretionary use permit. HELD: The application was granted in part. The court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal, the meeting was recorded, the council's consequent action was made part of the public record and the applicants had met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act did not represent an actionable commitment for the benefit of the appellant; and, in the context of this appeal, the Court found that it would be fatal to the appellant if the Chambers judge did not exercise his discretion to strike the claim."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.",The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage firm applied for and was awarded a commission of 10% on the basis of selling the lots at a rate of 6% less the commission on the previous sale. The plaintiff brought an action against both the broker and the vendor for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. The broker's lawyer was retained to represent the plaintiff. The court found that both parties were honestly in error in the issue of the oral agreement as the commission was subject to HST and in the absence of an enforceable agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. The issue was whether the agreement was enforceable.
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in $5,250. The petitioner was successful in obtaining medical residency in Canada. The respondent was a pediatric pediatric pediatric critical care fellowship physician. He resided in Regina for several years. The family immigrated to Canada in 2001. They resided in Saskatoon until 2014, when they moved to Regina. They then parted for the final time in April 2014. The court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the petitioner and ordered that he should pay interim support for D.K. in the sum of $5k per month. The parties then moved to Ottawa, where they again took up residence. This time, the petitioner was no longer residing with the respondent. They subsequently relocated to Ottawa. The Court found that the petitioner had an income of approximately $309,700 and, after unsuccessfully applying for and obtaining an answer and counter petition, both of which were opposed to the petitioner seeking shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property. The latter claimed that he suffered from health and safety concerns related to his son. The administration of the federal child support guidelines was found to be in breach of the parties’ separation agreement. HELD: On balance, the court found that both the petitioner children were doing well in their chosen field of medicine. The fact that the respondent was able to access the petitioner son during the day alleviated some of the concerns of the mother. The child was doing well academically and had a better chance of obtaining employment in Canada if he was permitted to travel to Pakistan. The issues were resolved by a reasonable compromise and the respondent would have been permitted to pursue her career in medicine. While the petitioner may have had more time to spend with the child, the reality is that the child was not receiving the best quality of care in the world when he was living with the petitioner."

The plaintiff sought damages for negligent misrepresentation. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentations on the part of the plaintiff. Nova paid Sign-O-Lite the sum of $875.00 month as rental, plus sales tax, less any monies paid. The defendant argued that the contract should be interpreted in a 'purposive' manner to protect the interests of the parties and to cut through all of the red tape. Awarding the plaintiff $2,430.00 monthly, that under the provisions of Clause 40 the plaintiff is entitled to receive compensation for unjust enrichment if the sign is erected within 500 feet from the centre line of the travelled portion of the highway. If the contract is not valid and existing, the plaintiff would be entitled to damages for unjustification."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The Court of Appeal declined to grant the damages Cross-Appeal. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the one it had previously pursued. The Cross-appeal was not successful. It was common ground that Gari took possession of the building and rented it out for storage. Its actions following Lakeland's default were inconsistent and inconsistent with that regime established pursuant to the PPPA. The court found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove a Building unless the Credit Commission paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown argues that the learned trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not question the credibility of either of the officers. The Court reviewed the relevant Charter issues and found that the trial judge failed to give sufficient consideration to other factors besides the breath sample count. 2) The objective grounds for the demand are the same as the subjective grounds for determining the objective grounds of the demand. The respondent's driving actions, his notable lack of swaying or other difficulties, his willingness to cooperate with the officer and his inability to orient himself are all reasonable grounds for an objective demand. 3) The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired include the glassy and red eyes, the smell of alcohol on the breath, stumbling and slurred speech. Generally, these alone are grounds for suspicion only, and absent some other form of objective evidence, would not be sufficient to ground a demand of this nature."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. The defence counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents in the weeks immediately preceding the trial. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a second day because of the uncertainty of when the trial would commence and the complexity of the documents. In the weeks following the trial, Crown counsel disclosed to defence counsel that the Crown had destroyed a number of email messages, some of which were from the complainant and others from the victim's residence and were from a special Enforcement Unit database. The complainant had not seen the documents, and defence counsel questioned her about their existence. The trial judge did not believe the complainant that he trafficked in cocaine, nor did he believe that he possessed steroids, either. Crown counsel argued that the RCMP had not conducted any meaningful review of the 1,800 documents and merely relied on the description of each document contained in the Index. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court found that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue was a new trial. As the Crown sought new trial, it was also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. The documents remain undisclosed and the Court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that it is not in the Court's position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident that occurred when the defendant's police vehicle turned left in front of her vehicle. The plaintiffs claimed the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. Damages were set as follows: damages for loss of income, loss of pension, and loss of motor vehicle insurance. The plaintiff was found to be contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A failure to see the plaintiff's vehicle approaching the intersection and the plaintiff being negligent for not seeing the police vehicle when it was in operation prevented the plaintiffs from examining the headlights. Liability for Motor Vehicle Accident (LAA) was assessed and determined to be in the range of $500 to $1,000.00. The defendant testified that he did not see the accident happen but he was aware that the plaintiffs vehicle was in the intersection when it turned right. He said he had no problem with the plaintiffs' headlights. The only vehicle observed by the plaintiff was the RCMP vehicle which was fifty feet behind the defendant vehicle. Corroboration of property damage was assessed as a factor of 3.5 and damages were assessed as being in excess of $5 million. There was no evidence the plaintiff sustained any damage to herself or to the vehicle as a consequence of the accident. There were no other injuries to the plaintiff and the baby were born with no complications."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to remedy the injustice of her husband being left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. He was given one-half of the matrimonial home or the proceeds of its sale equally. She brought a counter petition to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registrar imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960. The husband was awarded $25,000 but, because of an extraordinary circumstance, he was given 25% of the equity. He would be even better off to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home or to rental accommodation. The wife's house jointly owned with her mother was exempt property. Although it might seem that this case would fit squarely under subparagraph (b) of the Matrimonial Property Act, it was, in its entirety, inequitable and had the petition made no property claims whatever. The petitioner was employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. He also had the option of taking out his mortgage or moving out of his modest $20,000 house.HELD: There was a judgment for the wife for $960 plus an amount of $1 million for a grand total of 6,940. The matrimonial home was divided equally. Although the claim was inequitable, the court accepted the claim that the wife's home, jointly owned by her mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property and rounded out some of the numbers and ignored the fact that the mortgage on the family home was reduced by about $10,000 during the period in question. Both parties had the benefit of the home during the marriage. It is to the credit of the wife that at trial conceded that his claim for 50% of equity was perhaps unfair (i.e. inequitable) and that 25% would do. However, the claim in entirety is inequitable in that it was filed by a wife who had custody of the children."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He claimed that his breaks were for his lunch and an unpaid supper break when he was dismissed from his employment without notice. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had broken the company's overtime policy by taking a fifteen minute break during the day. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to an additional break for lunch on the second day. He also claimed that there was a breach of company policy related to breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15 for an hour of break and $5 for lunch, that the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. For the plaintiff, this was a case where he failed to demonstrate that his overtime policy was reasonable. The court found that the defendant had failed to follow the rules in his employment, and that it was unconscionable for the defendant to dismiss him. The plaintiffs claim that they were entitled to a 15 minute break for their morning break and an additional 15 minute breaks for lunch. Dismissing the claim without notice, that there is no reasonable excuse for the breaches of the policies. The Court held that the company was justified in dismissing the plaintiff because it failed to establish that the policy was sufficiently strict and reasonable. On the issue of the burden of proof, the Court found that it did not find that the failure to distribute the rule in writing was a sufficient cause for dismissal."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The estate applied for party and party costs in relation to a claim for costs against the father. The father sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate and the daughter acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation' as the father had claimed and had relied on the deceased's will for most of his life. The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his mother's will and whether it was supported by an implied promise against revocation. The deceased clearly made a gift to him that failed. The issue was whether the father was required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son. The application in question was not estate litigation but rather a litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.  The father also sought party and partner costs. In light of the present position of the Hand and his daughter, and their determination not to order costs in favour of the father, those three parties will bear their own costs."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. In 1984, he started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991. He was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. The following year, he was appointed interim director. The VTH administrator was later appointed director. In this role, he also took on the additional responsibility of supervising and managing the hospital's operations. In his role as interim director, he successfully applied for and was awarded the $20 million renovation project. The administrator sought damages and costs. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. The defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 1) The court found that the plaintiff has established that he is defamed because he was the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace for the employees. The court accepted the plaintiff's defence of action of reprehensible conduct and failure to prevent and prevent intentional infliction of emotional trauma on the employees and the public. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. The words of the grievance were found to be directed at the plaintiff and his organization. The impugned wording was found to refer to two other unionized employees. It is not necessary for the court to find that one of the employees actively harassed the other, but the court must find that the other is an active participant in the harassment himself. Jurisdiction is therefore one of strict liability. 3) The plaintiff was found not to have been defamed as he had been the person initially responsible for the initial and subsequent acts of harassment and assault against the other employees. There was no basis or basis for the defendants to have relied on the imputed wording in the grievance. The Court found the plaintiff was not required to show that the defendant intended to do harm or, even that the defendants was careless. The tort is thus one of stringent liability. The s. 6(1) principle of absolute privilege extends to all statements made in court, including notices posted on bulletin boards, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Union, and by posting on the CUPE website. The defendant is awarded costs of the trial."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The accused had been drinking alcohol and was in the wrong lane when he hit a pedestrian. He was given a two-year conditional sentence. Prior to the onset of his sentence, the accused had driven at an extremely high speed in the city, running a traffic light, and hit a concrete barrier. One of the passengers was killed. Conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident revealed that the accused was consuming alcohol and that consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause or contributing factor. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. 1)The accused's actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to pay attention resulted in the fatal accident. His failure to exercise caution resulted in a sentence in the lower end of the range which would be appropriate for the offence. 2)Although he had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and had not consumed any alcohol or drugs, his driving was mechanically unsound and he took the risk to do so. He is remorseful for what occurred. Corroboration orders were placed on his shoulders to allow him to complete his sentence."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants asked that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 215(1) for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and a finding of liability, and sought injunctions against the defendants, return of property taken, and damages for breach of contract and disgorgement of all profits gained through the breaches of fiduciary obligations. The defendant argued that the documents seized under the Anton Piller order were relevant because they were from a joint venture with a major accounting firm and were subject to the confidentiality and non-competition agreement. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had breached that agreement and his contract of employment. Application to strike portions of the claim dismissed; the defendants’ application to sever the issue of liability was dismissed. The court reviewed the relevant case law and found there was a clear severability between the threshold issue of disclosure and the consequential issue of damages. As the plaintiffs had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations, the joint venture required confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the plaintiffs obligation to maintain a fiduciarian duty and the plaintiffs would suffer serious prejudice if the issues were to be tried."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court testified that it was common for persons accessing the Internet to access a particular file sharing network (e.g. a laptop computer, desktop computer, or similar file sharing program) to access the same physical location. As the Internet is a global network, and therefore, it is not centralized, the file sharing software can't be trusted to have the same serial number on its installation. The Office of the Chief testified that if two people, in the same house downloaded Shareaza on their separate computers, they would have different G.U.I.D. numbers on their installation. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of accessing child pornography because the internal IP of the computer was tied to that VIN number, MAC address and the physical MAC address of that particular computer was non-password protected. As a result, the Court concluded that both the accused's computer and the Internet address used by the sharing network were the same files and that the common denominator of all the activity was the same IP address."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. Following separation, the petitioner was making mortgage payments and paying utilities. In May 2012, he advised she would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would be reducing the child support payments to $926. He also indicated that he would reduce the child tax credit to $1,300 per month. The parties have shared custody of the children. After separation, however, the respondent was paying mortgage payments of $1.200 per month, child support of $600 per month and utilities ($419.00 per month), rent, rent, groceries and household expenses. He brought a motion to have the respondent share the family home with respect to child and spousal support. HELD: 1) The respondent's application for interim relief was struck and the Local Registrar was directed to remove the image of the petitioner on his affidavit of October 16, 2012.  2) The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. There was no agreement that any agreements reached at the meeting could not be used in evidence.  3) The parties had three children and a basement suite. The respondent brought a petition claiming child and Spousal Support together with exclusive possession of the family house. The Spousals Support Advisory Guidelines were tooled up to allow the court to have a closer look at the economic consequences of the tax provisions. 4) The Court was premature at this point to make any determination as to whether the respondent remains under employed. Whether the respondent should be employed at something which is 40 hours per week year round was an issue which will be left to the pre-trial conference."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages in a jury trial for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of $409,251.18. The defendant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the evidence. Awarding the defendant $75,000 for future loss of income, that (1) there was no evidence of impairment to the plaintiff's ability to earn income in the future, and (2) the jury was properly instructed on the use of a 3% discount rate. The jury was instructed to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings component.  The defendant's cross-appeal was dismissed."

The Youth Court judge, finding that the evidence of the appellant's sister and girlfriend was not accepted, did not make any findings of fact or determinations of credibility on this essential matter. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although a number of issues have been raised by the appellant, the critical matter in dispute is whether or not the Statements taken at 17:11 hours and 19:50 hours were voluntary statements.

e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The proposal failed and the owner was imprisoned for 12 months. The owner appealed the order and sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Land Use By-laws. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the court in the amount of $25,000. 1)The Court found that the owner had done absolutely nothing to purge the deliberate contempt of January 9th, 2001 order. 2)It was reasonable in all the circumstances to set the deadline as the 1st of January, 2002.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the problem by arbitration. The landlord challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to award damages. The tenant sought to quash the award on the basis that the arbitration clause in the lease was a limited arbitration clause, which was not patently unreasonable. The arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine who was responsible for repairs, but also to rectify the lease and to use other canons of construction including estoppel. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. On the expiry of the lease, the Tenant vacated. The dispute arose between the Landlord and Tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair. dispute also arose about insurance coverage and whether insurance should have covered the damage. The parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness with respect to the claim and arbitration clause and that the arbitrators' decision should be limited in scope to the scope of the arbitration to which they could have proceeded. The court concluded that this was a case where, in the face of a strong privative clause, curial deference ought to be extended both to the determination of facts and the interpretation of the clauses and to the award of damages. To do so it would be necessary to consider parol evidence."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.",This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The Law Society of Saskatchewan law firm was in the position of counsel for the plaintiffs since their appointment in 1998. The plaintiff had not disclosed any of the matters to her former clients at the previous firm and the screening measures taken by the firm were sufficient to ensure that no disclosure to any member of the new law firm of the former client's confidential information would occur.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(b) of that Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it prima facie unreasonable. Based on the totality of the above evidence, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The evidence paints a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by driving, the absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. The Court held that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused painted a virtual stereotype of the motorist who had impaired by the alcohol. Consequently, the Court found that it was reasonable to conclude that the most obvious cause of impairment by alcohol was impairment by the blood alcohol level.  1) The officer had reasonable grounds, both from the perspective of the officer making the demand and an objective observer, to make the demand for breath samples. 2) The absence of any indicia commonly found in impaired drivers does not undermine a finding of reasonable and probable grounds based on the observed indicia and available information viewed in totality. 3) The Court found no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Code and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 4) The accused was found not guilty."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision pursuant to s62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president had not examined his company's lease at the time of the hearing and was told that his employees should have followed the rules imposed upon them. The adjudicator upheld the director's order and the appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. His decision did not appear to be patently unreasonable. The appeal based on the submission that the employer had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract was dismissed.  2)There was insufficient evidence to show that the respondent was incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 3)In the circumstances, the employer was simply contacted by the franchisor/employee in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the respondent and her employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. 4)It is not patently unfair to interfere with the adjudicating process by simply examining the lease (which was not produced at the hearing) with the company's counsel. The issue before the court was whether the adjudication erred in law in finding that the applicant had not failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in the employment contract. 5)Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to circumstances of this case. The second ground of appeal based upon the adjudicated authority exceeding his jurisdiction also fails. It was not sufficient to show the employer, as the respondent's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that hadhibited her from reporting to work."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant doctor who treated the appellant three days after he underwent a circumcision on him declined to answer the interrogatories he had previously objected to on the basis that it required an opinion. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. The respondent did not attend the hearing and indicated by letter that he supported the appellant's position that the appellant was a subsequently treating physician. Dr. Miller has provided the appellant with complete copy of his file and has answered several interrogatories concerning the medical services he provided to the appellant. There is no dispute that only relevant interrogatories need to be answered. Even though the chambers judge considered these interrogatories and determined they were not relevant, the appellant asks this court to require the doctor to require him to do this. In the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of the doctor the appellant will pay the doctor's reasonable hourly rate. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as provided for in the order of the chambers justice. The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert’s opinion is clear to the trier of fact, who will have to assess the weight to give the opinion taking this into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the trienter of fact discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. To allow interrogatories to be used to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  1) The appellant is correct in stating that a non-party witness can object to answering an interrogatory on a basis of opinion. It is not sufficient for the appellant to have objected to answering the balance of the interrogatory interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion, even if this involves reviewing information from other sources, including his opinion on the relevant standard of care, whether it was breached by the respondent and whether the appellant suffered damage as a result of the breach. The issues listed by the appellant in his factum are: Is the doctor in breach of his own Code of Ethics? 2. Should the doctor be appointed a court expert and be required to answer all questions put to him in both sets of interrogatories? 3. Should he be required by law to answer interrogatories that require his opinion, including those involving the treatment of the appellant? 4."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It did not matter whether the appellants were Indians under the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, or whether they possess aboriginal hunting rights independent of that agreement. The fact that the Indians who took treaty in 1906 did not have an aboriginal right to hunt at night with a search light did not affect the appellant's assessment of the facts. 2)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, the Sparrow test, which was used in Sparrow, and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. The safety purpose of the legislation was not discussed. 3)It was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting right. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The question is not whether the Aboriginal/Treaty right is to hunt in night with artificial lights but whether there is an Aboriginal right at the core of Indianness. The interjurisdictional immunity was not triggered by the legislation. The issue is whether the limiting bill is a prima facie infringement of the appellant's right and, if so, whether it is justifiable. The appellants, as hunters, were not subject to the regulation. 4)The evidence did not show that night hunting with lights was so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal rights. The Sparrow test was not applied to this case. 5)The appellant had failed to show any error in law that affected their assessment of facts as found by the trial judge. The evidence was not proven that the appellant preferred as a community to hunt night with an artificial light. 6)Safety was not the only test to be applied. Safety was not involved."

The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had not considered the provision in Rule 19 (1) considered by the court and that the earlier service upon the defendant was registered mail. Therefore, dismissing the application and certifying the earlier mail did not constitute proper service. The plaintiff is entitled to the taxable costs of the applications."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order of the Director allowing the Landlord $787.50 as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was damp and riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The Tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. Landlord denied the allegations, and awarded the sum to the Landant. The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. The Director was essentially correct, although her discounting of the value of the furniture and clothing went a little too far. She allowed $712.50 for the furniture, $50.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing for a total of $862.50. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court accepted the Director's assessment of damages as being higher than originally thought. Although the plaintiff's original estimate of damages was not entirely credible, the Court assessed the damages at a revised amount. 2) The damages were significantly higher. The plaintiff's claim was entirely circumstantial and it was impossible to believe that the Tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, it was not impossible for her to believe she would have taken this action had it not been for the bylaw inspector's findings."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.",The applicant was the surviving spouse of the deceased. She received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent SGI opposed the decision as it was based on the incorrect calculation of the death benefit. The applicant appealed the Queen's Bench decision. HELD: The respondent's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the applicant the death benefits as provided for by the Act and for the two dependent children in accordance with the directions of the Queen. 1)The fact that the deceased's income is based on her net income was not the same as that of her income replacement benefit but a self-contained formula was used. The death benefit is one-half the 'income replacement benefit' in Division 4. The meaning of this payment is that the payment is made to the survivor on a weekly basis.  2)SGI was awarded interest on thebenefits not paid (ss197(4)).
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer, Nielsen Ashdown Flying Services. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski used reliable independent sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant. This clause has the effect of relieving the defendant from accepting the second lowest tender for the project. No unfair advantage was given the defendant in selecting the successful tenderer. 3)The subjective term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist in the contract. The person who invites the tenderers must treat fairly and equally. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get a contract. There would be no competition and no purpose in putting up a tender."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The father asked that the children be returned to him immediately. The mother supported the father who proposed that he continue living with the mother and take anger management courses while she first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he began addressing his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the father had been on methadone for most of his life and that he had given up drugs after being apprehended by the Ministry. He had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles and failures to comply with the dispositions made with regard to his offences. The youth had been in the care of the Ministry since the birth of the children and there had been some non-compliance with the terms of the PSA. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band and the Ministry having access to the children through the Ministry and the permanency panel had facilitated the parents' access to counselling and support and the parents had expressed their concern about the father’s relapse. The parents had entered into a verbal agreement whereby the father agreed to participate in and complete parenting class and attend anger management, remain drug free and provide all drug screen results and the father would work with the Ministry on a parenting course. The parties had also agreed to abstain from alcohol and drugs during the course of the parenting course, which was a form of consent order that the mother would enter into with the father after completing the parenting class he was taking and completing the anger management course. H.H. was the mother’ s representative on the PPSA and although the mother was the social worker on the file, she was not able to locate the father because she had not seen him for the past four years. The social worker at the clinic was also unrepresented on the hearing and although she had seen the father on the street, she did not know him personally and he did not appear to have any of the above mentioned issues with her. The non-residential services agreement was filed at Tab B-31 and the documents were found at Tab A-32. The policies regarding access and access for the parties and their children and their families were filed as exhibits at the Family Law Division."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is a repeat Violent and Sexual Offender who was in prison for 15 years. He is also a repeat sexual assault survivor who was out on parole. He did not take appropriate programming in the Pathways Range and was removed from the range before the accused came along. HELD: The accused was granted one recognizant. The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit a serious personal injury offence are reasonable. They both have the required subjective and objective fear and apprehension that he will commit another serious sexual offence or sexual assault. These fears are serious and imminent for the accused.  1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal system at a young age. There was no de-escalation in the violence and became entrenched there. The sexual assaults got worse over time. He has over 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they speak to his lack of self control and impulse behaviour. The fact that he is now assessed as high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming is of significant concern to the Court as it gives an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. 2) There are a number of factors that contribute to the assessment of a person's risk to commit a sexual offence. The most significant is the fact that the accused is an adult male and that he has had the opportunity to participate in programming for over 20 years. There is a very real risk that he may offend again and that his security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The Court was unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentencing must be dismissed. Your state of mind at the time you made the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated you from responsibility for them. This defence was put to the jury through your own evidence, through your summation to the Jury, and by the judge's summation in the jury trial.  2)Since the sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial, it was now moot: that is, there is no issue to be decided on a conviction."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is also asked to set aside the duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast implant. The defendant denies the allegations. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. 1)There is no causal connection between the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, and the plaintiff's damages. Rather, the pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendants, The Dow Chemical company and one of the other defendants, namely, Dow Corcorning Corporation. 2)Dow chemical was founded in 1897 in the State of Michigan and incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1947. At present it is publicly held corporation organized under the laws of the state Delaware having its principal offices in Midland, Michigan. 3)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages both in contract and tort. She is also alleged to have been directly and indirectly caused by the actions of the defendant. There is a causal connection to the defendant's and Dow Chemical's negligence. 4)The defendant is at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious Liability where no fault is attributable to the third party, but there is a relationship such as that of an employer, employee, or principal agent. The defendants are in fact an agent, creature, or puppet of the Defendant. 5)The Court must assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary, although any uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved in favour of the defendants."

The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. The bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and had no dependants. He was a self-employed contractor and had an enviable income. HELD: There would be an order requiring the bankrupt to pay to the trustee the sum of $18,000.00 for distribution to the un-secured creditors. 1)The bankrupt could accommodate a payment of $500 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. 2)The trustee calculated surplus income of $435 per month and recommended a conditional order. It would take approximately 18 months to complete the terms of the order. The objecting creditor was entitled to costs of $400 out of the estate. 3)A conditional order was ordered during the term of the conditional order which the bankrupt would be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income and G.SI. filing requirements.  4)The court carefully reviewed the financial material on file and considered the submissions of the parties. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. The bankruptcy has a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations which stretches back at least 15 years. Not only does the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also does not file his returns. The unemployed contractor is 43 years of age, in health and has no dependents. He is a self employed contractor. He can safely accommodate $500.00 per month without jeopardising his ability or ability to make payments in arrears. Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arriars. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make monthly instalments payments of $7800.00 he would be remiss if did not offer the court's assistance to educate the bankrupt on this obligation."

The applicant claimed her 1996 income of $128,000 was extra-ordinary as payment was received for projects completed in the previous two years. The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born in September 1986. Both parties were medical practitioners and each enjoyed significant income. HELD: 1)The significant income enjoyed by the applicant was a factor to be taken into consideration when determining the balance of the child support application for extra-ordinary expenses. 2)The respondent was to pay maintenance on an annual income of $150,000, or the sum of $1,076.00 per month. 3)With respect to the claims for nanny and child care costs, I am not satisfied the applicant has established that these claims for recreation and a university fund are expenses that are special or 'extra-ordinary"". However, am I satisfied that the claim for Nanny and Child care costs is justified pursuant to s.7(1)(a) of the guidelines and theclaim for medication is justified pursuant to sec.7 of the Guidelines. 4)The applicant should be responsible for approximately 2/3 of these expenses. These expenses are approximately $1 million monthly to cover nanny, child care expenses, approximately $125 per month for medication, $200.00 for creation and $200 per month to help with the re-creation fund for the child.  5)Costs of the application were already paid in full as of May 1st, 1997.  6)Any monies from the Court had already been made out to the parties since the order was made."
e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. In issue was whether the defendants had misled consumers. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiffs had followed the judicial authority and determined that the defendants' summary judgment application was appropriate. The Court held that there was no genuine issue for trial and that the Court would continue to hear summary judgment applications before having to decide the plaintiffs' application for certification.  2) It was uncontroverted. The plaintiff misconstrued her own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case. The case at hand was the one in hundred class action case where summary judgment is suitable. The more stringently the criteria of reliability and necessity must be applied, as it risks usurping the role of the trier of fact. In this case the Court was comfortable with following the steps set out in the Rules of Court and determining the defendants'. 3) The court was in agreement with the plaintiffs that this case was suitable for summary judgment. It was only the named plaintiffs that would be subject to this dismissal. There was no application before the Court with respect to the claims as a class as whole. The expert evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs was conclusive that the Defendants had not specifically directed their mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and alleged that the defendant had misappropriated the funds necessary to construct the project. The defendants counterclaimed for the sum of $3,604.13 which they alleged represented the losses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's frustration with the plaintiff's proposal. The plaintiffs sued for the payment of the $2,200 deposit and sought damages for misappropriation of funds and miscellaneous damages. The Defendant corporation was found to be responsible for $961,961 in the amount of $1,758.13. The Plaintiff in the counterclaim submitted sufficient evidence to show that the defendants had misapplied the contract price. In his counterclaim, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was responsible for approximately $1 million of the misavocations and damages. He submitted that the plaintiffs had abandoned the contract in frustration and that they should bear the risk of expenses lost due to frustration of the contract because the plaintiff had more experience in constructing glass sunrooms. The Court awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant, in a 65/35 ratio, based on the fact that both parties acted in good faith. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the Ens job site. The dispute note was filed in the spring of 2004 and it was alleged that one of the parties, the plaintiff, had verbally rejected the defendant company's proposal for the project, which was supported by evidence that the parties had discussed and agreed to the client's request for a deposit. At issue was whether the plaintiff should bear any of the costs of the proposed project. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $1.961 million.  1) The plaintiff failed to prove the claim on a balance of probabilities.  2) The contract is not reasonably forseeable by either party. The change in the fundamental nature of the contractual contract affected the fundamental essence of it. The event was permanent and non-transient.

HELD: 1)Judgment for divorce was to be issued in the usual form after January 1/98. 2)The respondent was to pay as maintenance a lump sum of $18,000 free from any income tax. The interim maintenance order was to terminate with payment for December 1997. The wife could find employment but at a rate at or near minimum wage. She had no motivation to work, having convinced herself that there was no work available and that her health did not permit it.

b_1998canlii971.txt,"The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The trial judge found that the Act was ultra vires the Legislature and that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, S.C. 13, and that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation'. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The Crown appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. As for the federal legislation, it has been assumed by both parties that it is in pith and Substance criminal law as was decided in relation to its predecessor statute by majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Attorney General of Canada and the Crown appeals from that finding. The issues at trial and on this appeal involve the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence. The question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent and ensure the effective operation of the system."
7_1995canlii4340.txt,"The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle. The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after trial. His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent was charged with failing a breath test. He had been stopped by the RCMP at a spot check program. The stop was part of a stop under the R.I.D.E. program whose principal purpose was to detect, deter and reduce impaired driving. The roadside test was conducted as part of the spot check programs. The police officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance and found that he was slightly slurred. He refused to provide a breath sample and informed the officer that he would be charged with failure to provide one. The RCMP officer then asked to have the appellant accompany him back to the police cruiser and gave him a breath demand without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The appellant refused and the officer told him that he could have a conversation with the accused but that the conversation would not be productive. The accused argued that his s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act on the right not to be arbitrarily detained is a reasonable and constitutional legislative enactment. The flexible approach to the argument in favour of the Crown was found to be in breach of s. 7 and s.8 of the charter. While the wording of the ALERT test in the roadside stop was erroneous, the fact that the appellant was subject to detention which was sufficiently lengthy to provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel under the Charter was not an error."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before the Court as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. The respondent consented to the draft order filed by the applicant and the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. While the Court has great sympathy for the family in not being able to attend all of the trial for personal reasons, it has serious concerns about the ramifications to the administration of justice. This is an application that is both novel and unprecedented. Saskatchewan has developed a protocol for accommodating the participants of a trial process by way of video conferencing. The Court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order allowing video confcing for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. It is regrettable that this decision has been made in a country over which this court has no jurisdiction or control."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The accused, a young person, born December 25, 1985, was charged with murder. The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for interim judicial disclosure on the grounds the accused was in the community awaiting trial and would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown applied for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1)whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for judicial interim release; and 2)whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the Youth Offender’s Act decision. HELD: The jurisdiction for the determination of interim judicial releases of a young people charged with the murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the province in which the election is made. The issue then becomes for a youth charged with an offence set out in s. 522 of the Code what is the definition of a Youth Justice Court judge?

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault or whether she should be convicted for one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The Court stated that the mens rea or criminal intent required for common assault under s. 266 and assault causing bodily harm under s.(267) is identical. The accused said she hit the complainant with the candle holder. However, both her warned statement and her evidence are punctuated by the statement: 'I don't remember.'

b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The issue was whether the Stewards from other jurisdictions were entitled to notice of the hearing.

The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The hearing was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. 2)The court was not able to review the evidence as to whether the findings were correctly or erroneously made. The decisions of the commissioners and the Labour Court rests on an interpretation of s.32 L.C. (Rule 20 of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act). 3)The test of natural justice is to determine whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or whether there is an error on the face of the record. The court was left with the option of either accepting or rejecting the applicants' submission that the hearings were transparent and appropriate, or to reject their submission."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from it. The next day, he withdrew $20,000 in cash from the account and deposited it into his bank account, depositing it in the CIBC Bank account and withdrawing the $24,000. The bank reported the fraud to the Provincial Court, giving the accused a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. The Crown appealed the conditional discharge. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of the 1 year conditional sentence. The accused was 28 years old and had no previous involvement with the system. Having reviewed the pre-sentence report, it was concluded that there was a rather intricate kiting system that was involved in the fraud. The conditional sentence did not reflect the gravity of the offence. The offence was significant and should attract a criminal record. The sentencing judge gave proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1). A conditional discharge is granted only if that disposition is both in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the interest of the public. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and a 200 hour community service commitment."

Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a year to year lease in which they were allowed to increase the rent on three months written notice. The landlord refused on the grounds that the increase was only once every twelve months. The board held that it could not rely on the specific provision with respect to rent payable in the lease, as the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year if neither party gave notice of termination at least three months prior to the date of the renewal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the trial judge and the decision and recommendation of the board, that the interpretation of the Act, the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease were clear. The respondent could not unilaterally increase the rents during the yearly tenancy, for it would violate the tenants' common law right to notice."
d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (RTM) placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced a rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for rectification was dismissed. The court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events. The defendant knew the price for the RTM did not come with a basement. It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the basement. There was no agreement reached between the parties to pay interest. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the Court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached.
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The injunctions were imposed on a three-part basis and on a one-half-year non-solicitation agreement. 3) There was no evidence of competition or solicitation by the respondents in the sense that they did not oppose the solicitation of customers from Danka's employees. 4) The Court found that Danka had not put too much effort into establishing a strong case of imminent danger of substantial damage. It was also found that the respondent employees were in receipt of and use of the Danka employee Handbook. 5) The affidavits filed by the applicant showed no sign that any of the former employees had solicited or consented to the use of Danka equipment. The respondent employees bore the burden of proof that the inconvenience they would suffer by the refusal of the injunction was greater that that of the customers. Danka accepted the resignations without protest or comment.  6) Injunctive relief until trial was necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough. The affidavit materials did not indicate that either the president or anybody else on the respondent's behalf took objection to the notice periods given by the applicants. 7) The notice given was truncated by Danka management's request that the resigning employee leave the premises. The burden of evidence that the applicants will suffer the irreparable harm that will result from the denial of the employment contract and the subsequent breach of the respondent’s right to employment was reduced to absolute certainty."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information put forward by the respondent on which to direct an assessment of six years of legal services was not fair and that it could not be presumed that the respondent could effectively gather together the information on all of the matters he provided legal services in relation to so as to order the assessment as requested. As well, it was not sufficient to make a general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the same things to occur with respect to the amount charged. The respondent should have to explain the past six years."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she had been sexually assaulted at his residence on a number of occasions. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that the girl had been home every Friday night with the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue therefore was the identity of the person who had committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found that the evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. 2)The trial judge was aware that any evidence that could be categorized as 'oath helping' was not to be considered. The admission of hearsay was therefore an error that would have been fatal to the conviction, as it did not go to the credibility of young children."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who was convicted of theft, drove to the Canada-U.S. border station and was arrested by border guards after he pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000. The appellant had been previously sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate. The evidence provided by the respondent's father clearly indicated that his son had an initial counselling appointment with a woman of the same age as him. The affidavit evidence did not appear to address any of the issues raised by the appellant."
e_1998canlii13571.txt,"In issue was whether the parties cohabited for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their 1996 separation agreement to live separate and apart. The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. In 1997, the parties swore that they would cohabit for more than 90 days and this agreement was subsequently signed by the husband as a separation and apart agreement. The issue was whether the parties had cohabitated for longer periods than they claimed and if so, when. HELD: The application for a default judgment was dismissed. The respondent was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. He did not provide clear reasons for his decision to terminate the employment agreement but his action in applying for a non-judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The husband swore the parties cohabited for 10 days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until September 30. The wife swore that the period of cohabitation extended from June 30, 1997 until June 30. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the cohabitations would have extended for at least 95 days. The trial judge found the respondent to be an intelligent, articulate andforthright person and more particularly as an individual whose life has been largely controlled by her former spouse and by the events that occurred during his search for new positions in the health care administration field. He was found in contempt of court for failing to grant the petitioner a stay of execution."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (Family Maintenance Act) which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from any solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order; and(b)restrorbs the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation the Action or any claim against the Attorney-General of Canada pending his application or any court order.HELD: The respondent argued that a restraining order granted pursuant s. of the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He argued that the criteria for granting a preservation order are identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. The Court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMMA) and found that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent or equitable jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under the Act. HELD: 1)The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. Likewise, the ex partee order is lifted as against the attorney-general. 2)The amount of money set aside was purely arbitrary and could not be raised based on evidence available at the time of such application. The amount of notice which may be served may be reserved for the judge presiding over any hearing on the application or a motion to lift the restraining order which was made pursuant to s. 5 of the FAMMA.  3)The Court reviewed whether the criteria set out in s.55 of the Family Maintenance act (the “Act”) were meant to be the same as those applicable to restraining orders in other jurisdictions. The criteria for the preservation order were identical in that if the entire proceeds from the Action were disposed of, the petitioner’s claim would be impaired or defeated. However, if the Action results in between $100,000 to $143,500, as hoped for by the respondent, it is unlikely that the full amount would be required to satisfy any"
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The mother, who had been the only family member who could secure loans to pay for her education, brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike the father's application. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order, both designed to cover the mother's past educational costs. The father had filed a defence and added the daughter as a third party in 1997. Application dismissed; the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The mother's application failed on two grounds. The first was that the father should be responsible for the repayment of the loans; there was no evidence the daughter had taken the deduction as contemplated in the agreement; and the second application was an attempt to enforce the father’s obligation to pay off the loans. Although the father indicated that the daughter could rely on the loans, the amount of support was not known to the court. The only thing advanced in support of the daughter was her loan payments for educational purposes. The daughter had completed high school and was working towards her university education. Although her father had secured several loans, she was not concerned about the form of relief as it was retroactive. The payments were made to the mother during her university years and she was able to rely on them in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The son had completed his university education in 1996 and was employed as a student. The family had secured loans to finance their education and the daughter needed to repay the loans in order for the mother to be able to depend on the father for any extra support she might receive. Although both parents had secured financing for their daughter to complete her education at Boston College, the father was responsible for financing her education on the basis that the loans were secured by him and his wife. The wife was unable to obtain financing for the daughter to finish her education due to the father having been unable to pay any of her loans in the first place. The husband was responsible to pay all of the student loans and the mother was solely responsible for supporting the daughter. The application was frivolous and it was impossible to assess the cause of action. The court found that the application was not frivolous or scandalous in light of the limited amount of material evidence entered into before the proceeding, nor was it vexatious or scandalious."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made an issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for a trial in the application. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the test in Quaintance is based on a rebuttable presumption. Where there is an evidentiary burden on a challenger, it is on the propounder. It is therefore appropriate to review the authorities as they are an option for the Chambers judge if the evidence itself is not in dispute and the only questions are the inferences to be drawn from the facts. 2) It is pertinent to note that the respondent's task of proving the legal requirements of the estate was assisted by a rebutation presumption. The test in quaintance was, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. 3) The test here is whether the evidence presents a genuine problem for trial. The respondent has failed to establish that there is one. The evidence is inconsistent and inconsistent on material points and the credibility is in issue. The presumption, however, may be short-lived. The trial will affect the ability of the respondent to rely on the presumption. There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The fact that the respondents all professed to have been close to the respondent throughout his life does not change the fact that they are estranged from each other. The question arises as to whether the respondent has the capacity to adequately supervise and supervise the execution of his will."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to a failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information and the applicant was still denied further information. In September 2007 the applicant appealed the decision of the Appeal Board which found that the applicant did not have the assets as alleged by the Department. The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date he was assessed in June 2007. The application was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the court enforce mandamus pursuant to the Act and the Regulations. To do so, the applicant must have costs in the amount of $750 exclusive of disbursements."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. The Court found that the applicant had established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children and that he was in a position to pay spousals. Although there was no evidence to support the assertion that the petitioner had established that she was entitled to interim spouse support, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the parties lived together, the Court ordered that the payments be paid in the amount of $2,349. This amount is the amount that counsel for the petitioner indicated she would like to see paid to her. Given the short relationship between the parties, a modest transfer would go some way to relieve her from some of the economic hardship she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits payable under the Act were payable in the amount of $47,427.00 being the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3). The deceased was not employed and not receiving any income when the accident occurred. Nor would she have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to the death benefit, which was zero. The income replacement benefit, in this case, was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.145(5 or s146(6)."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004 the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the action. In September 2004 clarification was requested and, with the consent of the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: It was the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in this proceedings. It is the defendant who has status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the directors of the company. 1)As a corporation, the defendant is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. 2)As individuals may only litigate with legal representation, the Henry is empowered to appoint him/her. He was appointed for that purpose and is obliged, as 609's counsel, to so instruct 609’s counsel. Whether the counsel is a lawyer for the plaintiff 609 or someone else from outside the firm or remains to be determined. Such matters still pertain and, without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement, the costs remain with the plaintiff."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as a prior warrant issued that day. The applicant claimed the accountant had given him advice and assistance in preparing the tax return for his wife. He alleged the informant had obtained the information in an unauthorized search of his premises, and that he had obtained it through a fraudulent cross-examination. The affidavit filed by the accountant alleged that he was advised by the lawyer that the applicant did not appear as an employee on the T4 summary prepared by the trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of the company. The accountant demanded the return of the documents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)It was clear from the outset that the informant's evidence did not rise above the level of reasonable apprehension of bias. The fact that the documents were found at the plaintiff's place of business and in any storage facilities occupied by the plaintiff and her husband did not raise the issue of suspicion. 2)The affidavit material contained incomplete and misleading information. It was impossible for the informant to obtain information which was relevant to the purpose of the search. 3)The court found that the affidavit material did raise reasonable and probable grounds to issue a warrant to search a dwelling house which had long been recognized as the individual's most private place. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that did not seem to be reconciled with the company payroll. The errors in paragraphs 20-23 and 22 were undisputed, serious and serious. Without denying the potential seriousness of the allegations, the respondent would not have sought the warrant without the information."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff had a cause of action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. The AGC argued that notwithstanding finding a Cause of Action, the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. The statement of claims was based on an undertaking to respond in damages and costs and did not disclose any supporting details. It was also argued that the amendments did not add anything to the statement of action. The defendant argued that there was nothing novel about his action given it was rooted in legislation. He argued that he had been convicted of conspiracy to traffic and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment and that the Crown did not push the matter all the way to forfeiture and, instead, returned it to him in 2004. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the plea. 2) The amended Statement of Claim does not add nothing to the Statement of claim that was before Justice LeBlanc."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

The Registrar made no error in discerning this from the evidence and in exercising the court's discretionary jurisdiction to remedy this substantial injustice.","The respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A competitor, Datarite, operating through the appellant, acquired the claims of eighteen creditors and voted them over the objections of LaserWorks at a creditors meeting. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. LaserWorks appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that while there had been collusion by the creditors sufficient to deprive them of the right to vote, the Registrar did not err in concluding that in the circumstances the appellant controlled the way the claims were voted. In fact, the Court found that DatarITE engaged in an improper purpose in acquiring and voting the claims, they remained debts of the insolvent debtor. The Court found: 1) that the trial judge erred in upholding the Registrar's decision that the appellant engaged in a improper purpose for acquiring, voting, and voting against the proposal; 2) that there was no evidence of improper motives on the part of the Registrar, who was justified in finding that the purpose of the appellant was to remove a competitor from the market for its own purposes; and 3) that he failed to appreciate the nature of the evidence before him, overlooking the only piece of direct evidence on the evidence on which the Registrar was found to have been wrong."

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1)years probation, restitution in the full amount of overpayment and two (half) years of probation respectively. The decision to appeal the judge's sentencing recommendation was a fit sentence. While the agreement between counsel and the judge was not binding on the judge, the joint recommendation made to him was a fitting sentence. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than one half as submitted in the joint recommendations. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the restitution orders were amended by reducing the amount ordered to be repaid by one half to $32,866."

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan.

Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. The trial judge found that the plaintiff breached her duty of loyalty by competing with PCS for the contract while she was in its employ. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September 2005. In the interim, the plaintiff hired an apprentice instrumentation mechanic to work at the plaintiff's site. He left the position he had been in in August 2005 when he was given only two months notice and was told there were no members available for him to hire.

In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer.

The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that he owned several machines and tools prior to the marriage. Over the years he has owned and operated several machines, including a tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the value of the snowmobile fixed at $800. 3) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The Court found that the father owned the tractor and that it was subject to the distribution. 4) The petitioner shall have three months to pay the amount of the judgment. 5) The interest earned would not be exempt but the petitioner may apply to this court for directions as to sale of the Family property including the family home. In the circumstances, the Court treated the machinery as being family property and did not take it into account. 6) The Court awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their 3-year-old son; and awarded child support to the appellant of $2,726 per month. The appellant appealed only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. He has made all of the payments required by the order, except for the spousaling arrears. The respondent has filed a garnishees to collect those arrings.

7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so that she could obtain a degree in Accounting. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant.

8_2002skqb144.txt,"FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Gozanski, et al, (1994) for example.  1) The registered owners have had ample since their separation to resolve their family property dispute.

The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.",The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until further order. 1)The applicant raised a substantial question to be tried. The Court established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect or anapprehension of injury. It has shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights are doing so in a manner which is in breach of that right. 2)The balance of convenience in the matter favours the applicant. The application for interim injunction could not be granted until trial.
2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property. The conviction is at the low end of the range but in these circumstances there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. A more significant issue is the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeited of the vehicle used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests'. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. He noted the respondent's depression and expressed remorse."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for worker's gradual onset stress. The appellant appealed on the basis that the tribunal failed to take into account the worker's subjective view of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. Appeal dismissed; the Policy is declaratory of the law on this aspect of gradual onset trauma claims under GECA; the appellant failed to give weight to the opinion of the appellant’s treating psychologist in the Court of Appeal. The court reviewed the history of the legislation and found that, in the early years of the policy, there was no evidence that workplace events or stressors were unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation; and there was uncertainty about whether the existence of workplace stressors should be assessed objectively or subjectively. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The policy was based on the best available evidence. There was no inconsistency with the approach required under the policy. The policy set out the better view of law that applies in the absence of the Policy. 2) The objective view relates to the assessment of the nature of the events which the worker claims gave rise to the stress. That these events are to be examined objectively in the sense required by the Policy does not mean that the worker’�s perception of the event is irrelevant or should be ignored in determining whether there has been an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment. 3) The Court reviewed the law in different stages of the appeal, all of which were reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. 4) The appellant was not challenging the decision of the Board."

The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

The Court found that in advancing their claim against one insurance company, the defendant failed to sufficiently disclose the existence of the second policy. HELD: The Court held that the defence's standard of proof was on the balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged.

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of the vehicle contrary to ss.253(b) and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood contrary to the Criminal code. The accused testified that he was in the passenger seat and crossed to the driver's seat of an idling vehicle to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence.  1)The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80 might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)The only issue on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time.  3)There was little, if any, danger of the car being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public."

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

He also alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. The father appealed.

Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial, let alone an order in favour of the father. The evidence did not establish either of the accused's allegations.

The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.

HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The Court found that beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and at all material times, the Court held that there was a breach of fundamental justice. 1) Where there are inconsistencies between the Crown and the Defence witnesses, I accept the evidence of the Crown witnesses over that of the accused.

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005.

The trustee refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. The defendant applied for summary judgment and a consent order was granted directing that the defendant take possession of the assets which gave rise to the action for the purposes of completing an inventory and liquidating the assets in accordance with the normal duties and powers of the TrustEE. The plaintiff was awarded reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the premises and a detailed inventory and results of liquidation were to be filed with the court. The applicant was awarded summary judgment. The court found that it was clearly part and parcel of the defendant's attempt to mislead the Trustees and avoid the repossession. The evidence advanced by the defendant was overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist.

The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal; if so, what period of notice was appropriate. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in a relatively short period of time. This is not to suggest that the plaintiff was overpaid for the work that was doing. Rather it seems to be due to a dirth of employment opportunities in the Truro area or an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at very modest rate as illustrated by the case of the respondent. 2)It would be unfair to take the position of employee of 6 years of age and women of 5 to 10 years as inferring that the 6 year old would have been better suited to work part-time. 3)The employer bore the brunt of the blowback resulting from the plaintiff's decision to terminate her employment. She was dismissed for cause. 4)The plaintiff had no notice of any of the proposed changes until the letter of June 23rd, 1997. 5)She was awarded prejudgment interest of $1.00 per hour. 6)The 7)The notice period was appropriate for the plaintiff to have been given in light of the fact that she had been employed for 6 years. 7)Costs were awarded in the amount of $10,000 plus $1,000 for lost wages and vacation. Both terms of the contract were struck with prejudice to the claim of damages."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in with their two children, aged 9 and 11. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the parties' relationship was traditional, the father had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters (see: 2012 SKQB 275). The father has bounced from home to home. The boys receive minimal direction or discipline. There are three bedrooms in the basement one for each of the children and one for the mother. There is no reason why this should be the case. The past four years have been particularly difficult for the children. Their only source of income is child tax credit and child support paid by the father of the two children. They have had minimal direction and discipline. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred purportedly because the father was unable to afford it. He is currently employed full-time and the mother is assisting with the renovations. Despite his physical injuries, he was assisting with renovations. Although he had little direction or control, he is making an effort to improve his living situation and is making efforts to improve himself and his family. The parties' current circumstances are complex and require constant vigilance and consideration of each other's best interests."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","HELD: The application was granted. The respondent was directed to pay child support based on an income of $150,000. The petitioner opposed the application to completely discontinue the child and spousal support obligation and further for all support arrears to be expunged. The court found the respondent had not proven that he could not earn consistent income. It was also found that he had not been able to find employment in his chosen field or otherwise to continue to earn an income. The Court found that the respondent elected not to challenge the imputed income made 10 years ago. The issue was whether the respondent's support obligation should be varied to reflect a lower income than that imputed in the original order. HELD: 1) The original order was correct. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) In approaching variation, the respondent needs to show material change in circumstances. The ability to vary an interim order has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Prescesky, Presky. The decision of the Court in Presky was an interim one. It is appropriate to consider the order in the context of the income as found in the earlier order of McIntyre. 3) The Court must accept the original decision was correct at the time it was made and must then determine whether it is reasonable to allow the payor to escape his obligations if enough time elapses. There has been continual attempt by the Maintenance Enforcement Office to enforce the arrear. The reason why income had to be imputed is because the respondent was working full-time and had not paid any child support for the past 10 years. There is no evidence that he has endured significant financial difficulties or that he is unlikely to be able to continue with the manufacture of the invention. While he has suffered from mental health difficulties, he has been earning consistent income and continues to be in the middle of the pay cycle. It appears he has not had any difficulty finding employment in the chosen field, or being in contact with his chosen company, or otherwise, to continue earning an income for which he is not able to pay in the future. The defendant has made an assignment in bankruptcy which has caused him to lose his income for a period of time. He has not been earning a consistent income in the years 2005 through"

The respondent's application for enforcement of the award is granted without costs.  2)The Court was required to give judgment enforcing the award. The matter was heard and determined by the arbitrators. The scope of review of leave appeal was limited to question of law.

Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth. HELD: The application to adduce evidence on appeal was dismissed. The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer (1979) and the Civil Procedure Rule 62.22. The procedure to be followed in dealing with an application for adducing fresh evidence should be as established in R.'s v. Nielsen and Stolar (1988) 1 S.C.R. 480.

Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she sought exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Mistrial ordered. The accused was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence. She was entitled to re-elect. There had been a trial and the accused had made significant decisions regarding the conduct of her defence, including agreeing to waive her right to candidature prior to trial and to make a specific agreement regarding re-election. The Crown had not disclosed any of this until just before the close of the trial. The complainant had been prejudiced. She had made strategic decisions regarding her strategy regarding the admissibility of the evidence, including not allowing her counsel to participate in the trial process and agreeing to testify if her motion to dismiss was not successful at the end of the defence motion. The delay in disclosing the new evidence affected the complainant's ability to make full answer and defence. The court was satisfied that the complainant had succeeded in demonstrating a breach of her right, which was made out on the evidence. There was no evidence that the accused's decision to exercise her right of re-elected privilege was prejudicial to her. The trial judge's decision not to allow her to participate at trial was a significant one and it was of significant importance to her because she had negotiated a confidentiality agreement with the Crown prior to her making this decision. The agreement between the defence and the Crown was significant in that it preserved her re- election right to vote. The decision to not allow her counsel access at the trial was also significant because it would affect her ability to participate on a jury trial and would adversely affect her credibility. This was not a case where it could be said that the disclosure of evidence which can be used to impeach or discredit the accused, but rather a matter of fact fact that can be said to have affected her credibility in light of the fact that she made this agreement with her own counsel prior to the trial and that she was prepared to testify. The judge negotiated with the complainant beforehand and before the trial even began, allowing her access to the evidence during the trial"

The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part (RTCA). An appeal motion was brought in chambers and the appellant, as a preliminary matter, applied to have his suspension, probation, and probation rescinded, and to prevent the Investigation committee established to investigate the matterfrom taking further further action; the application was premature as there were other avenues of appeal available to the appellant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V.  1)There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs of grace being writs 2120 of the Queen's Bench Chambers judge and thus the appellant must demonstrate the Chambers judges abused his discretion. The application is premature as the remedies prayed were discretionary by virtue of the writ being writ of grace (see Rimmer v. Adshead). 2)Given the long delay, including the delay in seeking recourse attributable to the applicant, the Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event. 3)The appellant must show the Chambers court abused its discretion. No error of principal, nor any misapprehension of or disregard for any material fact has been demonstrated. Nor did the judge fail to act judicially and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they had not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in the legislation. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant provided a letter of commitment enclosed with the cover letter. It did not require that it be a forwarded or unequivocal letter from the financial institution to it, and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. The Court noted that in Saskatchewan farm land the plaintiffs have committed themselves to the Farm Credit Corporation, who as it turns out was not prepared to provide such a letter, and they also incurred liabilities with Farm Credit Corp for loan processing fees and solicitor costs. 2)The Court noted the difference between an unconditional and unequivocal commitment by a recognized financial institution and one which is subject to strict compliance with the legislation, namely, that the FFR act requires an unconditional or unequivococal commitment from a recognized institution to finance the purchase of the land. The Act requires that financing be made in a reasonable period of time, which in this case was not the case in Saskatchewan. 3)The loan approval issued by the defendant was not an unconditional, unequivocal pledge. The loan approval was not a letter to the contrary. The FFR Act requires binding commitments by a person acting in the capacity of the lender. In this case, the defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance by the legislation by offering a different requirement for the exercise of the right of First refusal.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff set at $1,000. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $4,000 that he paid to the defendant. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. However, the plaintiff demanded they be effected and withheld $4 million to ensure compliance. 2) The plaintiff was not entitled to pay for extras but was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3) The amount of the damages owed was set aside and the claim dismissed. There was no precedent for the defendant to be liable for any deficiencies. The Court could not accept that the plaintiff paid anything for extras.  4) The Plaintiff was not owed any of the monies owed. He was not responsible for the cost of the renovations nor was he entitled to interest. The Plaintiff's claim for loss was dismissed. 5) The Defendant did not press on as might have been expected. He did not ensure that the program of construction was clearly defined and adhered to. The amount which was to be charged to him was the actual cost to the defendants. He suffered a loss of $1.8 million or $2,400.00."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with. The Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s.258 of the Code, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same. That evidence consisted of the testimony of his three friends whose evidence related to the appellant having abstained from consuming alcoholic beverages in their presence and not to whether he had care andcontrol of his vehicle during time frame No. 1. 2)At issue was whether the trial judge erred by drawing the inference regarding time frame 2. The appellant argued that the conviction must be set aside in the absence of evidence proving the coexistence of impairment and care and care by alcohol. 3)The inference was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
6_2004skca168.txt,The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,"The appellant appeals from an order of Ryan-Froslie J., which directed that the daughter of the parties attend kindergarten during the seven week period before trial. The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. The respondent's motion under Rule 15 is now moot. Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party. Since we addressed the appeal proper on its merits, the motion to 'quash' was dismissed as being a waste of time and resources."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one years. In the present circumstances, the estate is substantially smaller, the children have a longer period of dependency and there are reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. HELD: The estate was to be divided equally between the two children. A reasonable provision was made for the maintenance of Tyson who was entitled to share equally with his brother."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed in s. 146 and s.35. The acquittalals based on the constitutional defence which were the subject of this Crownappeal were ordered. The Metis applied for intervener status on the basis of changing the constitutional question to commercial fishing. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)It was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respectto commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against the accused. 2)The Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue. Rather the appeal was limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). 3)It is open to the accused to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to fishing for commercial purposes as a potential defence to the charges. 4)The trial judge erred in law by failing to conclude that therequirement to obtain a licence beforeengaging in fishing by means of a net setout in s26(a)of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations does not constitute a prima facie infringement of any existing right to the fish for commercial purpose. 5)The proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for food, because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial activities, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or forCommercial purposes. 6)The accused were relying on s. 91(24) and 146 of theConstitutional Act. The regulations are justified."

The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division found that the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted as he was unable to work in the investment dealer's capacity. The decision was set aside by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and the respondent was ordered to reapply for a hearing on the charges. The applicant applied to have the hearing set aside and the penalties imposed on him for professional misconduct dismissed. Application for interim injunction granted as the matter was premature. The trial judge erred in finding that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal where those proceedings are vexacious."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of property obtained by crime. The Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money seized were possessed for the use of trafficking. HELD: The accused was convicted of all three charges before the court. The evidence seized was admissible against the accused. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the accused, but that, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapack, and because no one else had access to the cocaine, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there. It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s.

8_1999canlii12948.txt,"FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

The applicant sought an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs had breached confidentiality and were in conflict of interest between clients. She asked that they be removed as solicitors of record. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. A solicitor for the applicant took the position that no solicitor-client relationship existed and, therefore, Chapters IV and of the Code of Professional Conduct have no application. No solicitor client relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm when, what proved to be confidential documents, were received by her. The fact that the applicant now supports her wife in her defence of the action against the plaintiffs does not change the situation that existed in 1995. No breach of confidentiality took place and no conflict of interests as between clients exists. The only relationship that existed was with the applicant's wife. Since there was no solicitor relationship and no other duty was owed to Lois, no relationship existed relating to the firm which she is a member of. HOLD: The Application was dismissed.  1)No solicitor- client relationship existed between Lois Hudson and Lois Hudson resulting from the acceptance by Ms. Polischuk of documents from her. Whatever duty was to her was to the applicant. She did not give any instructions or instructions and as the documents were not required in the proceedings then underway, they were forwarded to the lawyer for Lois Hudson. No instructions were given as to what to do or to refrain from doing. It cannot be said that any breach of a confidentiality occurred or a conflict-of-interest arose as contemplated by Chapters III and V of the Professional Conduct. To extend the confidentiality of solicitor client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in my view, lead to unreasonable results.  2)Since no solicitor had a relationship between Lois and the Law Firm of the Law (the law firm which was incorporated in 1995), what duty, if any, was owed by Lois Hudson to Lois Hudson? Since no solicitor was owed in Lois Hudson's favour, what duty existed only relating to her law firm?"

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The mother applied for permanent care of four children in 2001. The children range from approximately 5 ½ to about 2 years of age and are the offspring of three (3) or four (4) fathers. All four children have been in temporary care with the mother since December 2001. In January 2001, the mother advised the Agency that the children were in need of protective services and that they would remain in the care of the Agency with access to both the mother and the father. The Agency refused to admit the mother into its care, and in February 2002, the Agency conducted a psychological assessment of the children and found that they had head lice infestation. The mother was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. She was out of the mother's care for several months and the children had been out of their mother's custody for nine months. The father, who had recently been diagnosed with ADHD, indicated that the child would remain with the Agency and the mother would cooperate with the completion of a psychological and parental Capacity Assessment.

The foster parents had cared for a four and one-half year old girl who was in foster care at the time of her birth. The parents now wished to have the child returned to their care or have her remain with the present foster family on a long-term basis. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. 1)The natural parents were unable to care for the child particularly given her special needs. 2)The foster parents were ordered to have reasonable access to the child. 3)It was absolutely clear to me that it was in the child's best interest to remain where she was and tocontinue to have contact with her natural parents. Given the special needs of the child, it was unlikely that an adoption plan would be made, and indeed to remove the child from the foster home could be extremely damaging and emotionally traumatic for the children."

The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody. The Wife was to have access to the child upon reasonable notice to Husband. The Husband later changed jobs and moved out of Saskatoon. At the time of the agreement, the Wife was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She had just undergone treatment for depression and was in the hospital for psychiatric treatment. She was the primary parent of the child. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence that the child or children are in some way at risk. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to the Child exists). In this province, that means obtaining a pre-trial date for pre- trial conference and if the matter is not resolved at that stage, proceed to trial where the Court will determine what is in the best interests of the children. 2)The applicant was granted access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:00 am.

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in March of 1972. The Plaintiff claims he was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either under the Indian Act or any other relevant Act or Statute in force under the Canada Pension Act. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. All claims brought pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act are subject to a limitation period of 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members. The Court found that the plaintiff failed to adequately describe an identifiable class; (b) to demonstrate there are proposed plaintiffs who would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class; and (c) to produce workable litigation. The plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCPJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had already elapsed. The Crown appeals its decision and argues that the Youth Court Judge erred in her interpretation of the Youth Code. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the legislation is the same as that in R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (SCC), [unreported] and [unreleased] except that the provincial director has the power to order a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the youth and, until the young person is apprehended, he or she is deemed not to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the youth person is then serving. 2) Section 102(2) refers to s. 102(1)(b) of the Code. It is a modification of s.102(2)(n) which, with any modifications that the circumstances require, applies in the context of breach of community supervision orders. The meaning of the word 'apprehension' in s.107(1) is expressed in the meaning and purpose of this legislation. The essence of the argument is that the youth should be able to escape community supervision without consequence. A sentence imposed after due process and careful consideration by the sentencing judge should be complied with in full. An interpretation of conditional supervision and the provision that a young person can avoid community supervision by remaining in custody for a period of time after the warrant was issued does not directly undercut the objectives of rehabilitation and reintegration. The youth's sentence does not run until the sentence is over. 3) The relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and running of the sentence itself is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss.109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in other words, that it"

The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it.

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.

The father sought costs of $3,000 based on an application of a scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act. The amount involved was $40,000. Costs of $1,000 were assessed against the father. The parties' parenting arrangement for the children was set aside. Costs were imputed to the father; the father did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The issues were complex and time consuming. Costs in the amount of $65,000 are assessed against him. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the father was the appropriate primary care parent. The applicant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed by the father (he did not increase his child tax obligation by the amount). Costs of the $3k were assessed on an adjusted basis. In the end, the court imputed an income level to the applicant that she was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The costs award was based on the amount involved in the calculation of the costs and fees."

The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court, before she had a trial, before anyone had given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she has had a chance to defend herself at a trial. HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial was completed. The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and determined that the appropriate sentence would be imposed. The Crown had argued that its case was strong, the offence was horrible, and the public in La Ronge and area were so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public. The accused youth was not related to the current charges or accused youth in any way. The public in the La Ronne area is aware that we do not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a someone in custody before they have a trialHELD: There was a necessary reason to confine the accused Youth to custody even before she was sentenced to a trial and before anyone has given evidence in a Court of Law, before her defence has had the chance to testify at a Trial. The youth is presumed to be innocent until he or she is proven guilty at trial. There was no evidence that she was a danger to the community or that her release would cause any other danger to herself. The Youth was Released on a condition that she must show her face at her trial, at least at the Court of Appeal hearing, and at her next court appearance. The Court believed that the public was aware that the Public was so disturbed, shocked, and shocked that the occurrence resulted in serious injury to a member of the community. Several individuals have told the police that the youth is responsible for those injuries. Several persons have told police that this youth is also responsible for them. The police have investigated and are still investigating, the circumstances around the injuries, and her release will continue through her trial. We do not accept that a person be confined in custody without good reason."

However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation. The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 1993. The amount of the respondent's income, as reported in his income tax return for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $71,501, $73,272 and $74,476. He asserted that the indebtedness of the company was $1,600,000. However, nearly $600,600 of that debt represents shareholders loans. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay $150,000 as maintenance for the child for the period January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004 on the basis of his annual income of $72,800. The sum of $561.00 per month was to be paid in installments of the child's hockey expenses in August and September as well as child expenses in January and August 2004 based on the total child expenses incurred in that year. 1)The parties were to exchange $150 of child expenses for $200 of hockey expenses.  2)The father was to pay the petitioner $150 per month for hockey expenses of his own. 3)Any additional income from Canadian Well Servicing Ltd. and Southern Range Well Services was to $27,200. 4)Any adjustments to the father's annual income were to be made based upon the total expenses incurred by the parties in the year in which their income tax returns were filed. 5)Any expenses incurred on the child shall be adjusted accordingly based on his total income.  6)Any payments of child support shall be made to the mother on June 15/2003 based upon $150/month payments based on Brady Melvin's total expenses. 7)Any improper expenses shall be provided to the parties pursuant to s. 88 of the Guidelines."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. The applicant is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The application is premature. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994.98 and interest arreaars of $995.03 or total of $30,990.01. The statement of claim was not noted for default prior to the application being made for the hearing. The affidavit filed by the applicant's broker was incorrect as the amount of the mortgage included items in addition to the principal outstanding and the interest arrearars. The defendant understood that the property was listed at $70,000, but the Credit Union's position was that this is overvalued and would likely sell in the $30k to $45,000 range, based on their knowledge of property being sold in the area. The draft bill of costs submitted by counsel contains numerous items which occurred prior to and after the granting of leave. There was no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre- leave costs."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the defendant to a resort in Cuba. The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. However, this is still an 'action' and not a class action. This is still a matter between the plaintiffs and the defendant. The plaintiff wants the defendant Red Seal to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). 2) The wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of The CLASS Actions Act precludes this type of pre- certification notice. The Court must first determine whether the defendant is entitled to demand the plaintiff provide specific information pursuant to the Act. 3) The application for examination was dismissed because the defendant asked the Court to broaden the scope of its authority to make orders prior to certification."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. After the separation, the respondent took a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She testified that she was not capable of working full time, and testified she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. She also had a substantial debt but owned and had the ability to finance house. Given the circumstances, it would be unfair to order retroactive maintenance. The evidence before the court established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was only a few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spouse support of $600 per month. The order was permanent and no further review was fixed. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The Court found that the chambers judge had imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of living 30 hours week at minimum wage, although she testified that her disability pension was not a factor as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by the Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the Court to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 and the couples' daughter was still living with him and going to university full time. The Court discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the daughter on the basis that she is over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. 2) The court found that it was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable to become self sufficient. It found that"
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church""). It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the Minister) is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The Cape Bretons' request is based on the submission that the the Province is statutorily mandated to provide free of cost the buildings required to deliver the basic public school program. Although the Province under the Education Act is not required to pay the cost of providing school buildings, the Province has a duty to provide buildings to the board. This responsibility can be best fulfilled by either the Province negotiating and paying the rental cost directly to the Church or the Province reimbursing the rental expenses to the Board. Alternatively, the Board may seek the Minister's approval in light of the entire Act which regularly requires the Minister to permit the expenditure of capital funds on the buildings. In any event, the board may not have decided to enter into these leases. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the costs of supplying the building free of costs."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support owing $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An earlier corollary relief judgment was dismissed in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears of approximately $14,600 was granted. HELD: The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per child per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150.00 per month per child when he is less than $2200. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. 1)The father was advised that he was in receipt of social assistance benefits for a number of months but that his income had declined since 1994. Given the significant reduction in income the father had experienced since 1994, there had been a material change in circumstances. 2)The mother was to be paid $200 per month both on and off arrear. 3)The child support obligation was reduced to $25,600."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)It is incumbent upon the Court not to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor & client costs claimed by the applicant. The court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be ordered out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. 3)The judgment in March 1999 created a debt owing to the applicant from the respondent and the debt became due and payable on the date of pronouncement, being March 19, 1999. The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the timeof entering formal judgment. The jurisprudence is clear that a successful party to litigation who is free of blame should not be required to bear costs of either prosecuting or defending the action if an unsuccessful party is required to bore all the costs that are claimed by that party. The Court's discretion to award costs arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs (although the respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application)."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case. 3)The fiat in question was declared to be the result of the trial and all of the agreements made during the negotiations were set aside. 4)The court appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench in Zimmerman v. Childs Estate. This was an appealing appeal."

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. The application did not say what the question of question was and the applicants had not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; whether there are police reports; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors; whether they were located. The Court found that Nova Scotia is forum non conveniens. The applicants had succeeded in finding that Nova�scotland is forum conveniens and, following the next rule, unless the defendant could show that NovaSCADA could be found to be forum non- conveniens, the plaintiff's choice of forum would govern. The court also awarded costs to the plaintiff for dismissing the action for forum non non convenien that was refused. The substantive law which governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurs. The applicant had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right was subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum n conveniens or somewhere else in the province. The plaintiff's question of jurisdiction was whether he was barred from suing due to Nova Scotia being a forum non convenediens. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place of trial, and that is Nova Scotia."

The plaintiffs have not met that schedule in that they have failed to deliver their written arguments and authorities by June 30, 2010 as directed.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: The Court held that the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her privacy and security interests. In light of the nature of the offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy, security and privacy interests, the Court was satisfied an order should have been made."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATT on the road. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. At trial, the Court held that it was not that simple. The words'mot vehicle' in s. 287(3) should not be read to include a vehicle that was a prohibited vehicle or other vehicles prohibited from operation upon the highway by s. 11, since that is not the charge before the Court."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused was acquitted of all other charges. The trial judge focused on the factors leading to the conviction, not on the consequences. The appellant's final argument was that the trial judge erred in not applying the de minimis non curat lex principle. The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused's driving was not mere touching but it was caused by the accused pushing her towards the side of the road. The evidence showed that, apart from the two parked cars, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was allowed and the sentence of 18 months probation and a three month driving prohibition were imposed. The court found that, in view of the fact that the complainant was not cross-examined at trial and her evidence went in unchallenged, the court was entitled to deference in her assessment of the evidence. 1)The trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence; there was nothing in the transcript which suggested she took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the circumstances or the seriousness of the assault; and 2)There was no evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the conclusion that the appellant's manner of driving was dangerous to the public in all of the circumstances. The case law requires that the offence is an inherently dangerous activity, but one that a properly instructed judge and jury could not have reasonably attained. The principles of consent and driving are inseparable from the conduct of a reasonably prudent driver. The offence is inherently dangerous to society and is not capable of being rationalized. The respondent's driving, while dangerous, was not inherently dangerous. It was not in the nature of driving to be violent, dangerous or harassing. While there may be some unpleasantness to be had in the context of a domestic relationship, the absence of consent does not constitute criminal misconduct. 2)It was open to the court to accept or reject the evidence of the complainant and her daughter. The appellate court judge is entitled to considerable deference with respect to how she treated the appellant."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the children's benefit. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children’s provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of The Education Act and found that the CÉF had not complied with its commitments to the children. HELD: The Court held that the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the school and their failure to encourage the children to learn in French.  1) The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-right holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan. 2) The Court found that it was impossible for the Court to analyze the reasoning and facts of the law in light of the statements of claim made by the plaintiffs. 3) There was no evidence that the Court would be unable to find a satisfactory solution to the problems identified by the Court based on the evidence of the plaintiffs and their non-rights holder parents. 4) There were no reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the discrimination against the plaintiffs was based entirely upon the failure of the parents to comply with their commitments. The court awarded special damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, the cost of training and re-training of the service dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 22.3(2) of the Animal Protection Act and general damages for the respondents’ loss of a right to access the school."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be incapable of meeting the road standards as they existed at the time. The developer appealed the decision of the municipality's development officer declaring it incomplete. Application set aside; although the municipality relied on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle to the applicant's project, it was technically not a refusal as the applicant only appealed because it met the requirements of the by-laws. The municipality was entitled to a declaration that the application was complete and to an order of mandamus."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay half of the plaintiff's energy savings, a sum which the plaintiff claimed was part of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff paid the defendant what the defendant terms a deposit and what the defendants calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars and agreed that such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The defendants argued that there were triable issues between the parties and the plaintiff should not be regarded as a reasonable excuse for failing to file a defence. Dismissing the application, that the defendant had not made any reasonable effort to resolve the issue in Nova Scotia and that its failure to do so was neither a mistake nor an oversight."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce and custody was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was also disposed of. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crops but the respondent closed his case without further argument about calling evidence on the tax implication. HELD: 1) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declines to order any spousal support. 2) The respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. His income from his employment as a restaurant and wage labourer is $400 per month. However, the petitioner is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll and one-third of the value of the farm equipment. 3) The Court is satisfied that the petitioner has spent $100 per week of day care for the three children. She also pays $40 per month for play school. The total costs of $440 are to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. 4) The court declined to order spousals as it would cause the petitioner's income to increase. The respondent is entitled to $50,000 per year of farm income."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. HELD: The defendant was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of and the conduct of the examinations for which the plaintiff was entitled to rely upon.  1) The conduct evinces a breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the defendant knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not, he is not obliged to provide further particulars. 2) The evidence of breach of confidence in the defendant's ability to conduct due diligence on behalf of the plaintiff and for the benefit of the general public is conclusive. 3) The pleadings do not support a claim for damages for breach of a duty or breach of an interest."
