The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant sought relief in the nature of certiorari, attacking the constitution and jurisdiction of the board and claiming it had failed to observe the rules of natural justice. He also alleged nine errors of law, including that the board had not properly vetted the appellant's counsel and that it had not acted in good faith. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not seek relief in this way but rather sought remedies available under s.24(1) of the Charter."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the grandchildren of the deceased. The deceased had been involved in a motor vehicle accident which claimed her life. The action was continued pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1989, the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs brought special damages under different heads to compensate for the loss of guidance, care and companionship that the deceased would have provided had her death not occurred. The defendants applied for an order excluding the grandchildren from discovery examinations. HELD: The application was granted. 1)Nothing would be of value to the plaintiffs if the plaintiffs were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other. 2)The evidence was not sufficient to indicate that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if these parties were not included from hearing each other's evidence. 3)The court was satisfied that the plaintiffs had not met the burden of proof set out in the Act. 4)The Court was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence before it to indicate there would a violation or a violation the essential of Justice if the parties were excluded from the hearing of each others' evidence."
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Jessome. The judge granted the order on the basis that he had not met the requirements set out in the Queen's Bench Rules and that the adjournment complained of was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. The applicant applied to have the judge, who had been appointed to the Queen, quash the adjournments and who had not been able to attend the trial, be made available at the time of the adjourning. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge who had the discretion within his discretion and that any decision in that regard was an exercising of his discretionary discretion within the authority."
1994canlii3880.txt,"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The disposition of the 18 year old male defendant was not fit. The court considered aggravating features such as the police chase, the deliberate damage done to a number of vehicles, the intentional damage done, the large number of charges before him and the fact that he had co-operated extensively with the police. 2)The court considered the young offender's age, that he was of no criminal record and that he co-operated extensively with police."

1997canlii9808.txt,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,"The appellant sought to have support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent's income was incorrectly estimated and should have been much greater. The chamber judge accepted the appellant's offer to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and accepted the trial judge's decision that commercial realities required the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. There was no reversible error in the acceptance of the figure by the chambers judge in this instance. The respondent agreed to include a 20 percent share of his annual capital cost allowances as part his income. What, if any, portion of the capital cost credit should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible errors in the acceptance of this figure by this judge in the instance."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing scheduled to be rescheduled to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts were disposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The first ground raised a substantive issue as to whether the Commission hearing should be allowed to proceed because it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to finding of fact and determination of guilt on the same information as before it. 2)The respondent Authority and Commission have statutory jurisdiction to administer the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and the powers of the Commission are restricted to dealing with licenses or permits, to the exclusion of any other type of penalty. There is nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission considering a form of disqualification of the appellant's application. 3)The second ground raised an issue as opposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v.

1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in a narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Criminal Code and with cultivating marijuana without a warrant. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The voirse was conducted within which the accused was asked if there was a problem with the vehicle and if so, if so what was in the back of the van. The accused was detained and asked to open the back door as it was padlocked. The officer observed the accused standing at the rear of the vehicle. The police officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the van and the accused replied that there were. The conversation between the accused and the officer was not random and the police officer was conducted in an investigative mode. The only thing that could have made the search unreasonable was the fact that the accused had been detained and had asked to participate in the seizure of evidence. The search began with the questioning of the accused. The Court held that the conversation between both parties was an 'inconvenience' and that once the accused realized he had been arrested, he could not refuse to call lawyer. The Crown was not satisfied that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused required any assistance. The court questioned whether the officer's actions were reasonable and reasonable and the search was unreasonable. The issue was whether the conduct of the authorities, considered on an objective basis effectively and unfairly deprived the accused of the right to make this choice. The respondent was acquitted of all charges. The trial judge found that the respondent had reasonable, probable grounds and the warrantless warrantless conduct was unreasonable as it did not authorize the search."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions and the Crown appealed against the sentence. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from 5 to 10 years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal are difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before it. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. The present release would be inimical to the public interest, having regard for the whole of the circumstances. To do so would be to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice, given both the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect, as the Court of Queen's Bench would like to see it, of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served. The applicant also wanted to have his sentence reduced by 10 years to match the time he had already served in the previous sentence. The application was unsuccessful. The court of appeal declined to hear the application. The grounds of the appeal were difficult to evaluate in their full entirety, and were not assessed in entirety. The Supreme Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole is not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being is not necessary in the public Interest. The less say the better about the merit of the many grounds of appeals upon which the proceedings rest. The more say the less about the merits of the numerous grounds of review upon which they rest. In this case the Court was unable to assess the new grounds in their whole entirety, which was incomplete, because the material was incomplete. The material was also incomplete. On that material the Court is not convinced that the grounds of merit to be satisfied satisfy the requirement of clause(a) and (c) of s. 679(3) of The section. Turning to the general interest, the present release of the person would be an inimitable and inimitutive to the administration and administration of the justice system given the history of the past proceedings, the current status of the current proceedings and unlikelihood of the application of the Applicant succeeding"
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 to have his claim dismissed. The defendants applied for an order pursuant to Rule 188 extending a limitation period of one year. The plaintiff had a prima facie case and sought an extension of the limitation period. The parties brought a number of applications, including one that sought to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed, as well as an application for an extension to the limitation time. The motions were all dismissed. HELD: The application was allowed with costs under double Column V and the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. The court found that the limitation periods were not extended and that the plaintiff had not shown a primacy case. The Court of Appeal found that a limitation time of one-year is not a sufficient period to determine the existence of a defence to the claim. The claim was not restricted to events prior to the entry of the stay of proceedings. The only issue was whether the plaintiff was barred by a statutory limitation period or whether any limitation period should be extended. The appeal was allowed under double column V and in the other column V. The issue was the timing of the action. The plaintiffs had commenced the action within 1 year of the entry date of the trial. The limitation period was extended by 1 year. Even though the limitation was extended, there still was a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. The application to extend the limitation on the application was dismissed."
2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in May 1998. In May 1999, the parties would switch the child every second day and then every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. Since then, the child has resided with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and the petitioner. The petitioner asserts that the every second weekend access was interrupted by a couple of violent episodes instigated by the petitioner in the past. The respondent has had access to the child for the past four years. The court reviewed the affidavits of the family members and relatives of the parties and found that the child had and does reside with the petitioner with access to both the petitioner's and the husband's. The husband has had reasonable access. The wife has been granted interim custody. The child will have access to her every second Sunday and every day thereafter until further order. The Court reviewed the various affidavits and affidavits filed by the parties. The evidence from the spouses and the children was mixed. The father's income for the purposes of interim child support was $23,175. The mother's income was $4,921.96. The spouse's income in the interim was $5,922.96 (the average of her 2000 and 2001 income). The petitioner's income from the interim order was $3,919.96 for the purpose of interim support. The current status quo is that the Child has and does resides with the husband with access, with access/ visitation arrangements and the court focusses on the short-term needs of the Child. The relationship between the parties was stable and the mother was active. The children were doing well and had a loving, stable relationship with their mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in the petitioner’s best interests. The only issue is the respondent’ s current living arrangements. The issues are: are the current caregivers suitable role model and able to meet the child’S needs? Is there any reason to change the child? The petitioner”s income for purposes of the interim child care costs to be $4.921 (the same average of the average of their 2000 and2001 income)."

The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act.

The respondent corporations brought an action against the Superintendent, not party to the proceedings, but in which the applicant had an Interest by reason in Matrimonial Property. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the letter of August 6, 2002 was not a direction of the Superintendent but rather a set of letters, which may be enforced pursuant to s.16 of the Act.

For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The parties were married for five years and separated in December 2002. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The petitioner sought divorce and the parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The respondent sought to have the children's primary care giver for the children and for the father to have access every second weekend. The mother sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the children would equally share their time with the children, and the court granted the divorce judgment.

2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and breach of a recognizance. The accused was driving in anger toward the accused and entering his residence and striking the accused in the arm causing a fracture of his ulna bone. The assault took place while the accused was on the property with the accused. The complainant was on his property when the accused approached him and the accused walked toward him and struck the complainant in the elbow. The altercation continued and the complainant was injured. The Court found that the accused drove in anger towards the accused, despite being told not to enter the property, and entered thereon for the primary purpose, if not the sole purpose, of challenging the accused's authority to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property. The defence evidence showed that the assault was justified in using force to prevent the trespass. The offence was aggravated assault. The Crown evidence showed the accused had a knife in his hand. The knife was not in the complainant's hand when he got out of his truck. The defendant was not prepared to heed the obvious meaning of the gesture and was intent in prevailing over the accused to stay off his property and assert what he unreasonably believed to be his right to enter thereon. The evidence established that the defendant was intent on prevailing over and thereby placing himself in the role of an aggressor. The court found that although the accused may have believed the accused that he was a trespasser, he was justified to use no more force than was necessary to prevent his trespass."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders. The Minister took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that the child should be immediately returned to her care. The father of the children, who was also apprehended, took the positions that the three children were not 'properly' children under the S.11 of the act and that they should be returned immediately to their mother. The Ministry was also involved in the apprehension of the mother and the mother's relationship with the mother. HELD: The mother was ordered to have access with the children for 6 months and to report to the Minister any issues she may have. The court was not satisfied with the Minister’s request for a long term order. The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the mother had changed. The child was no longer hostile to the mother, the mother signed a number of parent aid contracts, the father was ordered not to monitor her diabetes closely and the child had been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purposes. The Mother was also ordered to attend anger management and parenting classes and to work cooperatively with the Ministry. The order of the Minister was made in respect of the three young children. The issues before the Court were whether the Minister should make an order respecting the three older children pursuant to the S11 of The Child andFamily Services Act. The evidence before the court was insufficient to support the Minister on the issue of whether the children were in need or not. The issue was whether the Ministry should make a long-term supervisory order under s.37(1)(a) of The Act respecting the children pursuant the S9 of the child and the children’ s.11. The questions before the judge were whether or not the Minister had properly placed the children on notice that they were in the care of the Ministry and whether the order of Wright J. was appropriate. The Children’S Custody Act provides for the protection of the Children and the Children‘s Rights. The children are to be placed in the custody of the minister until the age of 18 years of age. The parents are to report any issues to the Ministry regarding the children and their health. The Child’ll be placed with the minister for six months."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the plaintiff refused to pay the farmer and the defendant refused to supply the farmer with the oats. The plaintiff claimed pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from September 2006 until the date of judgment. The defendant claimed prejudgment interests on the amount owing to the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff had satisfied his contractual obligations to the company and thus entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the German millers. The Court found that although the farmer's responsibility was to ensure that the oats met the quality requirements of the contract, the defendant was not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the plaintiff; the plaintiff was not bound by it; the testimony before court established the plaintiff's obligation to pay $61,608 to the German was not transferred to the miller even though the plaintiff is not a a party."

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with one count of committing sexual assaults contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had consented to the examination of his blood and had consents to the analysis of his DNA. The Crown argued that the warrant was not lawful and the actions taken by the police were not authorized, and the use to which the sample of his Blood was put was illegal. The defence argued that written consent provided by the accused was irrelevant as it was nothing more than to ease or bolster the application for a warrant. The Court rejected the defence's argument that the accused had not shown any violation of either his right to be protected from self-incrimination or his right of secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s8. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was found admissible for the purpose of the trial. The court found that the evidence was not limited beyond the scope of the s. 24(2) Charter rights. The only remedy was to exclude the evidence pursuant to the s24(2). The accused argued that s. 487.05 of the Code contemplates analysis of a sample taken from a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance 'found' in circumstances described in s.485(1) of the code. The Code contem contemplates a broad interpretation of the biological composition of a person associated with the commission of an offence, ie. the product of conception following sexual intercourse with the accused. The purpose of this voir dire was to determine the admissibility of results of an analysis of blood taken from the accused by the Cape Breton Regional Police. The officer had been given the police caution and his Charter rights and the fact that he had consoled the accused did not change the fact of his consent. The trial judge found that there was no violation of the accused's s. and s. s. Charter rights, which he had demonstrated in the past."

Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives.

The Town argued that the by-laws were rationally connected to the objective and effectively addressed unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The respondent Town conceded that the provisions of the bylaw limited freedom of expression and the respondent Town agreed to reduce the number of signs permitted in the downtown core zone. The town appealed. Appeal allowed; order to issue pursuant to S. 266(3) of the municipal government act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. The Court found that the limiting measures of the By-law were rational connected to that objective and were effective in meeting the limits imposed demonstrably justified pursuant to the Charter. The limiting measures were rally connected to their objective and the effect of the restrictions on the speech was minimal. The limited measures were reasonable and were proportionate to the Town's objectives. The primary objectives of the BY-law are to preserve the town's character and to maintain a distinct aesthetic character.

The respondent's counsels' fees were increased to $500. The court ordered a trial of the issue as to amount of child maintenance payable. The parties could ill afford such expense and they would be poorly advised to pursue such a course. The Court dismissed both applications.

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

Nine defendants brought separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs' claims against the Walbaum Group were decided. The defendants were equal partners in the company and in November 1997, on the application of Morrison, Dun-Rite was ordered liquidated. The main defendant in the action was Dwayne Walbaum. Walbaum was solely in charge of the company. He diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies and his wife. The plaintiffs claim that the evidence against all of the defendants against the defendants was transferred to him by Walbaum, who was the sole shareholder of the defendant. Walba is the sole director and person in control of the plaintiff. The defendant is the main defendant.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).",The parties entered a parenting agreement in 2008. The parties had four children. The respondent sought to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in the agreement changed in as much as he sought a corollary relief judgment. The principal basis for the argument was a significant reduction in his income and a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the agreement because he is no longer in a shared parenting arrangement. The petitioner argued that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. The husband argued that he suffered a dramatic drop in income and that his income had taken a dramatic and unanticipated drop. The court found that the respondent did not engage in a binding or binding agreement and that the spouse's income had declined. The Court found that there was no suggestion that the petitioner did not seek to change the agreement. The corollaries relief judgment was not incorporated into the corollari relief judgment and the petitioner was entitled to a stay of execution of the corral relief judgment as set out in the separation agreement.
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The plaintiff sought to recover the value of its security after it was discovered that the supplier had refused to restock the vehicle. The plaintiff sought payment pursuant to s. 244 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The defendant sought to restructure the vehicle and sought to have the security transferred to the plaintiff by a third party supplier. The parties had agreed that the priority of the priority agreement was to be reserved for the purchase of new goods, used goods and trade-in goods. The third party suppliers granted the plaintiff credit on the security of present and after-acquired goods. In the course of liquidating the personal property of the plaintiff, the defendant returned parts and service manuals to the defendant. The defendants contended that the defendant was obliged to pay certain amounts to the receiver. The receiver objected that the word'specially' in the wording of the security was interpreted to include 'parts'. The plaintiff was awarded $88,724.59. The court found that the defendants were entitled to recover their security on the basis of the first issue. The second issue arose from the dispute between the parties. The respondent was entitled to claim prior security to the credits generated by the parts returned based on the reasoning that parts, the proceeds of parts returned and the credits thereby generated are not included in the assets in respect of which the defendant is entitled to be entitled to a priority. The issue was whether the defendant's security was sufficiently secure to warrant the return of parts. The only link between the defendant and the third party was that the third parties granted the defendant credit on security of current and after acquired goods. This did not affect the plaintiff's claim for restocking purposes. The Court found that there was no breach of the terms of the Priority Agreement. The issues were the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credit financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for. The employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the contracting parties and Wheatland. The respondents contended that TD did not have priority with respect to unused parts. In addition, the respondent was not entitled to any security for the return or the return services of the respondent. The fact that the specific reference to new goods and used goods indicates that parts are something separate or different. The existence and circumstances of the goods/parts issue is the cornerstone of the case. The critical issue is that the distinction is the distinction from inventory and credited to Wheatland for its use and for use by its retail customers."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. He applied for an order excluding evidence of marijuana and a stolen motor home on the basis that his rights under s. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. The accused was stopped at a motor home and his vehicle was searched. The RCMP officer who was conducting a traffic stop observed the accused driving erratically. The officer observed the motor home being searched for signs of impairment or smell of alcohol to assess his level of sobriety. The driver was not wearing a mask and the vehicle was not visible from the outside. The police officer who had stopped the accused and examined the vehicle and observed the driver's movements noticed that the accused was unusually nervous. The officers observed fresh black caulking around various external panels and at the front corners of the vehicle. The complainant indicated that he had smelled cigarette smoke but no alcohol. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags. The defendant volunteered that he was travelling from Vancouver to Thunder Bay to visit his sister for a couple of weeks. The trial judge found that the search of the motorhome was conducted without warrant and that the evidence was not relevant to the accused's right to privacy. The evidence was excluded because the accused had not shown that he infringed his right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s9 of the Canadian Charter. The Court found that there was no breach of privacy in the motor vehicle and that there were no unreasonable search and seizure claims made against the accused. The court ordered the accused to surrender his weapons and that he forfeit his licence and registration. The Crown ordered the seizure of the accused’s property and the seizure and forfeiture of his personal property. The search of his motor home was conducted by the RCMP officer and the evidence from the motor house was excluded. The defence argued that the officer’d reasonable expectation of privacy was infringed. The respondent’ s9 was not infringed and the accused did not raise any privacy issues. The issue was whether the evidence should be excluded under ss. 24(2) of the charter. The personal property of the property was not an issue. The property was seized and the property of an individual was infringe upon. The right to secure against reasonable and probable grounds for arrest was infringered."
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She appealed her conviction on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. The appellant had been visiting the victim of a robbery and had been assaulted. The victim had been sitting on the couch across from the kitchen table where the appellant was seated and that at some point shortly after they arrived, the appellant got up and proceeded through doorway behind the victim and choked him until he passed out. The police were unable to recover any of the money that the victim had lost. The Crown and the defence both testified that the appellant had grabbed a belt from a bath robe around the victim's neck and choked the victim until he died. The defence argued that the conflicting evidence was a credibility challenge. The appeal dismissed. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defense positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The principles set out in R. v. W.(D.) were recognized and applied. Appeal dismissed."
2_2011nssc338.txt,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","The applicant landlord brought an interlocutory action against the respondent landlord. The Small Claims Court adjudicator found that the respondent had not been hearing an application for declaratory relief. The applicant brought an application to the Small Claims Tribunal, which declined to hear the application. The adjudicator appealed. Appeal allowed; the Small claims tribunal declined to entertain an inter-locutory order. The respondent's counsel raised two preliminary procedural issues: 1) the adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small- Claims Court had jurisdiction to hear an application of the respondent for review of rental increase. 2) the Small Tribunal declined to refer the matter back for a continuation before the same Small Claims court adjudicator who made the ruling on the preliminary motion. The appeal was referred back for the continuation of the matter before the Small's adjudicator."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, s.5(1) and s. 5(2) for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location. He was observed by two undercover police officers who observed the events from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. The officers also observed the accused walking back up to the building and stashing the drugs in a rock wall near the transaction location. The Crown argued that the encounters between the accused and the accused were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. The Court accepted the accused's evidence on these practices and found the encounters with the accused are consistent with these drug trafficking activities and not inconsistent with any alternative explanations."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day on October 18, and half day on November 20, 2011. The Bowsers claim solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff “C” of $3000 to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. The Sheas argue this is not an exceptional case warranting solicitor client cost, yet agree that Tariff 'C' should apply to an amount of $2750 to which multiplier of two should be apply for a $5500 plus disbursed amount. The applicant also argues this is an exceptional situation warranting costs under the Tariff C. The applicants argue this case is not one of those rare cases where solicitor client expenses should be awarded. The application consumed one full day and effectively the morning of October 20, ending at 10:45 a.m. The hearing consumed one day and was therefore over 3.5 days. The court awarded the application for $3000 plus disbarments. The respondent's solicitor client client costs are $6000. The Court awarded the respondent's costs in the amount of the alternative cost of $2500 to which it applied a multiplier to the alternative amount of two. The costs are divided equally between the respondent client costs and the alternative client costs. The defendant's costs are the same as the respondent’s costs."

At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people.

The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The appellant, who was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently, appealed his sentence of nine months imprisonment plus two year probation to be made concurrent with the sentence of his previous convictions for dangerous driving causing bodily harm. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The power of a trial judge to impose sentence cannot be limited by the submission of Crown counsel or a joint submission resulting from a plea bargain. 2)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 3)The appellant showed recklessness and disregard for the safety of others to a very high degree.

Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.

The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The applicant had lost employment and a debilitating leg injury. He had been unemployed for almost 30 years. Fortunately the matrimonial property division coupled with spousa support provided her with sufficient financial means so that she was not required to seek employment after the parties separated. The respondent was now over 65 years old and receiving Canada Pension and Old Age Security. The husband was now employed and earning a modest salary. The wife devoted her full time to raising their three children. She was also able to obtain a proportionate share of the applicant's Canada Pension Plan benefits. The parties had three children together. The marriage was a traditional marriage and the applicant had been disadvantaged to a greater degree than the respondent. Although the applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the spousals were last revised, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. The agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousousal assistance was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial position of the parties. The Agreement reached by them in 1995 didn't provide that the spouse's income was either limited or varied if a substantial increase in the current financial position was to occur. Surely at the time the agreement was made, the parties contemplated their eventual retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them. Yet it is not likely that the parties intended spousAL support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of spousality in a marriage such as a traditional one. The application of these principles to the facts and circumstances of the case does not warrant termination of the respondent's spousaling obligations. The Court must give proper consideration to the factors, objectives and objectives set out in the spouses' agreement. The agreements reached by parties in 1993 and continued by the divorce judgment did not support the applicant to vary the level of support set out. The fact that the respondent stayed home during the most productive years of her life to raise the children, which enabled the applicant, in addition to his wife, to focus on his career, did not preclude the applicant from pursuing an additional position.

3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The Act provides for the filing of returns by means of a written demand. The notice of the appeal is signed by the Director of the Regina Tax Services Office. The applicant was the sole director of the corporation. The respondent was the only director of that corporation. There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge's finding that returns were not filed. The demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. The appellants had failed to rectify the omission after such reasonable opportunities. Once charges were laid the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable period of time. The appellant was not wrongfully convicted under s. 330 of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code. 2)The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. The Court was not trying to find that the appellant had directly participated in or acquiesced in the failure to file the return. There is no evidence that the respondent had signed the return as required by the Act or that the notice was signed on behalf of the Minister. The application was made in light of the recent amendments to the Interpretation Act. 3)The Court was unable to find the appellant guilty of pre-charge delay. The pre-charges were not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The trial judge did not have to decide whether the appellants should have been tried. 4)The appellant's failure to comply was not a reason to delay the appeal. The court was not dealing with an administrative act such as sending a return. The issue was whether the Act provides a'reasonable delay' to the appellant. The appeal is dismissed. 5)The fact that there was a facile signature on the notice is of little importance.
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This is an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s.81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue is whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. ITI retained discretion under its contract with its students as to what course materials it would supply. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. The court found that once ITI had decided what course material it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. The judge held that ITI's selection of the books in issue was subject to a sale at arm's length at time the supply was made. The plaintiff retained discretion over its contract to provide the materials and the students acknowledged that such changes may be made during the course of the program. ITII intended to use the books which had been supplied for a module starting at the end of August but they had not been distributed to the student as of the date of the receivership and the supplier's written demand in mid-August. The Court held that once the plaintiff decided what materials it wanted, there would be binding contracts for sale to the school. The Judge erred by finding otherwise."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. The Crown filed an affidavit to show disclosure had been made. The respondent applied to the Queen's Bench for an order of prohibition prohibiting the trial judge from continuing as trial judge. The trial judge granted the order and the matter was remitted to Provincial Court for trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The appeal must be allowed. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure fair and public hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even if the exact statement alleged to have been made by the accused may not be revealed, it may be properly inferred that there would be no attempt to introduce it into evidence unless it tended to establish the guilt of the accused, such as statements by the victim or intercepted communications. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. The accused applied to Queen's Court for an injunction prohibiting the judge from proceeding with the proceeding on the grounds that the judge failed to disclose to the trial jury any indication of criminal record. The appeal is allowed and the trial is remitted back to Provincial court for trial on the balance of probabilities. 2)The appellant appealed. The Queen's Counsel contends that an accused’s criminal record cannot be put into evidence until the accused takes the stand. Crown counsel contends that the trial had not commenced as no evidence had been called and therefore it could not be said the trial was put into a trial. Once Judge McMurtry heard argument in respect to the Charter applications, the trial commenced. Even though the trial Judge had not read the criminal record she was aware of its existence as her decision dated December 17, 2001, mistrial should be declared, permitting new hearing which will contain no record of the inadvertent error. The appellant’ s. 11(d) Charter rights were violated when the appellant”s criminal history was disclosed. The court found that the Crown did not have to disclose the evidence to the judge. 3)The Appeal must be permitted. The Appeal must not be allowed because the appeal must not amount in excess of the automatic disqualifications of the Court on the basis of apprehended or other bias, appearing of"
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. The mother had been unemployed for several years and the father had made an unsuccessful effort to find employment. The son had recently been fired by his employer, Ipsco, and was now unemployed. The daughter's father had been ordered to pay child support of $600 per month. The child support application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. The applicant's income was imputed to be $40,000. The application was made in light of the mother's ongoing employment and the fact that the father was underemployed. The court found that the applicant's decision to work only 3 months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. The family's circumstances included the age, education, skills, historical earning capacity and health of the payor; the standard of living experienced during marriage; the availability of work; the payors freedom to relocate; the reasonableness of the career aspirations and motives behind them, as well as any other obligations of the father. The Court found that on all of the evidence, the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and/or return to work was not an intentionally made decision and the child support he would receive would be payable on a net of tax basis. The Family Law Division ordered costs as against the applicant for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information. The costs were ordered to the applicant in the amount of $750 payable forthwith."
4_1993canlii6771.txt,"Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The father appealed the June 4, 1984 custody decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. Having regard for the governing standard of appellate review, found in Pelech v. Peleching and Talbot v.Henry, the trial judge chose to accept the testimony of the father's witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert witness who spoke as to the effect of abuse on children. The trial judge found no tenable basis for interfering with the trial's decision to grant custody of the child to the father. The award of maintenance was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wages (approximately $55,000 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant seeks to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving another solicitor having been active in representing the defendant, a Crown corporation, during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers. In so doing I was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)The applicant was being followed by a prior decision involving asimilar attempt to dislodge the applicant solicitors. 2)The solicitor's involvement in the litigation was not known to the public. 3)The information itself cannot be disclosed, however, it is reasonable to insist that the nature of the information be disclosed."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing his optometry studies. The plaintiff had an accident while water skiing which he associated with the events of the water skiing engaged in by Hurd. Hurd required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $26,864.46. The court found that the definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. The defendant was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery. The plaintiffs judgment was also ordered for costs to be taxed."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. The child's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. HELD: 1) The child has not shown that he is unemployed or that he has other children to support. His current income does not support the imputation of income. The court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputing of income 2) The mother has not provided the necessary evidence to establish undue hardship. The father has been unemployed for three months. The mother's current employment is below that of the other spouse. The Court must determine whether the child is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to determine why the table amount would cause undue hardship 3) The applicant has not demonstrated that she is unemployed. She has not indicated that she has any other children of her own. The evidence does not suggest that any continuing unemployment is intentional or, in the circumstance, that the table amounts would cause her undue hardship 4) The court has not found that the child has a serious medical condition which may result in undue hardship 5) The father's current Income is below what is normally required by s. 19 of the Guidelines. The only issue is whether the Court can impute income pursuant to s.19(1)(a) of the guidelines on the basis he is intentionally unemployed. If the provincial government turns down his proposal, the court will impute the child support order retroactive. The application involves claims pursuant to S. 7(1) and (d) which read as follows: 10.(1) The Court may order the child to take reasonable steps to support his or her children simply because the parent cannot obtain interesting or highly paid employment. The Child Support Guidelines set out the basis for an undue hardship claim. The Family Law Division has jurisdiction over the application. The Children's Law Division is the province's child support agency. The children's school fees are paid by the parents. The parents have a joint custody agreement. The family income is divided equally among the parties. The Father's income is $1,900 per month. The wife's income in the family is $600 per year."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a controlled substance. The search was conducted pursuant to two Saskatchewan search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The warrant was invalid because it authorized the search of the accused's residence. The evidence seized from inside the residence was legal and valid. The seizure of the property from inside and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and legitimate. The Court found that the search was unreasonable and in violation of the Crown's Charter rights. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at the accused’s trial. The Crown argued that if the court agreed that the warrants as issued are invalid then the resultant search of Smith’’ residence and surrounding premises was warrantless. The court found that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The accused‘s defence was that the warrant was issued solely based upon the information obtained by the search. The affidavit submitted by the accused and the affidavit submitted to the Court supported this defence. The affidavits submitted by both the accused, the accused himself and the accused were all signed by the same person. The documents submitted by each party were signed by both parties and the affidavits were all of the same. The only exception to this was the affidavit by the Crown’ s. 24(2) Charter rights which were not in issue. The defence argued that the affidavit was non-conscriptive within the meaning of s. 4 of the Charter and was not supported by the affidavit. The officer who signed the affidavit did not appear to notice the errors in the affidavit or the affidavit filed by the other party. The defendant’d testified that he had received numerous calls from the accused regarding the search and that he was aware of the issues before him. The respondent had not been aware of any of the problems with the affidavit and affidavit submitted in the voir dire. The information in the affidavited affidavits was of no consequence to the trial."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 1. HELD: The Court finds that the respondent has exceeded his or her financial obligations and is in breach of the terms of the Divorce Act. The Court does not refer to the impact of the Guidelines on retroactive child support applications. The court finds that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive support and that the circumstances leading to the award of the order have not changed. The respondent has not made this decision. The issues before the Court are whether the respondent should proceed with his application beyond the interim stage, whether the order should be made retroactive, and whether the Court should terminate the payments to his current spouse. The petitioner has not indicated that he will."

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.",The parties were married for approximately 15 years. They had two children and had two adult children. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The husband requested that the children be placed in the wife's care every second weekend. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. HELD: The children were placed in sole care and custody. The court found that the wife was unable to provide the children with adequate support and supervision. The children did not have access to the mother's computer or telephone. The Court found that there was a risk that the child would model aggressive and controlling behaviour in the absence of a parent. The evidence suggested that the mother was unable or unwilling to provide adequate support for the children and that the father was not prepared to provide support. The father's allegation that the husband would not allot funds from his pay directly to the wife did not appear credible. The child did not show any insight into her contribution to the deterioration of their relationship.

During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused applied for a nonsuit. HELD: The accused's application for disclosure was dismissed. 1)The Operational Checksheets and any reference to Exhibit P2 in the re-direct examination of the accused were excluded from evidence at this trial. 2)The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of disclosure. The Crown had not disclosed the contents of the Checksheet. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechsheets and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown. That said, the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during the defence's cross-examination of the author of the document. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in that original document, he would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the redirect examination which occurred in this case. 3)The officer inadvertently misconstrued the full content of the original check sheet and the prosecutor refers to the Checksheet in the Re-direct Examination without taking sufficient time and care to ensure the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. 4)Had he known the full contents of that original checksheet, he could have known it would have drawn the Redirect examination. Had the Crown not referred to it, the accused would have suffered actual prejudgment in his rights under s. 7 of the charter as a consequence of a breach of disclosure which resulted in the accused's right to defend himself. 5)Had the officer known of this discovery, he should have challenged the Crown's decision to refer to the checksheet in the original. The prosecutor referred the original to the Crown and the defence counsel. 6)The Court found that the officer's right was never infringed. The Court found the officer did not have the right to speak out against the Crown on the basis of bad faith. The court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of information."

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff sold business equipment to the defendant in September of 2007. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damages against unjust enrichment. HELD: The plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities. The court dismissed the action. 1)There was no material representation and no fraud. The plaintiff had always made his payments to the Defendant. There was no Material representation and there was no fraud in the agreement. 2)The defendant had signed an agreement to supply and install business equipment. The equipment was never installed properly and was in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff. There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. There were no material representations and no fraudulent misrepresentation or unjust enrichment and the defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and installed correctly. There had been no service contract between the parties. The Defendant had signed the agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with the equipment and that they had two and half years with the Equipment to commence the Agreement on the date to be established by Irwin. The Court concluded that there was a reasonable discovery rule which prevents the injustice of claim's being statute barred before the plaintiff becomes aware of its existence. The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The Plaintiff has not demonstrated any element that would warrant dismissal of the action and there is no material harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiffs. The evidence is that the defendant completed his part of the transaction. There are no material errors or breaches of contract or unjustified enrichment. There has been no material misrepresentation and no breach of the agreement and the plaintiff has proven that the defendants signed a letter of agreement to provide the equipment to him. The defendants have not done this and despite continuing to make all the regular payments on equipment, have done nothing further to ensure that it is working for the purposes for which it was designed. There have been no breaches of the Limitations Act. There will be no material damage to the plaintiffs' property. The plaintiffs' claim for breach is statute barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007. There must be no harm to their reputation. There should be no doubt that the plaintiff is content with the work done. There may be some other reasons for the delay in reaching a verdict. There's no material loss of property or loss of income. There would be no breach if the plaintiff were to return the money"

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs commenced a claim for wrongful dismissal and three causes of action. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, was advanced by the plaintiffs against the defendant, XTreme Mining and Demolition, and the third cause of action, inducing breach of contract. The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a, (c) and (d) of the statement of claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. The information contained in the statement was obtained by the plaintiff's legal counsel and was posted on the respective outlet's website and became widely available. The plaintiff's lawyer referred to the comments of Zarzeczny J. of the Court in Duke v. Puts, 1997 CanLII 11015 (SK QB), [1998] W.W.R. 510, 161 Sask.R.(Sask.R.). HELD: 1) The plaintiff was granted the order striking the paragraphs of the Statement of Claim. The paragraphs of media were to be struck as immaterial and irrelevant. The court found that the paragraphs were immaterial as they were not statements of fact and were not relevant to the plaintiff’s actions in defamation. The Court found that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff making these allegations. 2) The statements were to the effect that the plaintiff had made threats to kill other employees and engaged in violence and intimidation that prevented other staff from doing their jobs. The facts were not immaterial to the plaintiffs’ actions in this action. 3) The paragraphs were not intended to be a defence of the plaintiff. The defendants were fully aware that the plaintiffs were in no way responsible for any acts of intimidation and harassment and that the defendant dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The Plaintiff’ s claim for moral damages was not struck as it was not relevant. The statement of claims contained in this statement of Claim were not subject to the limitations imposed by the Queen’S Bench Rules. The only facts that were relevant to this action were the number of Hells Angels employed by Xtremere and the dates of their employment. The defendant’d made representations to the Plaintiffs that they could work for him until he chose to retire. The Plaintiffs were not represented by counsel at that meeting and were at no time advised that the meeting was being conducted on without"

She suffered from post-operative depression and was unable to work. She sought medical attention and sought treatment. She obtained a sedative which caused her to lose her hearing and her blood pressure. She refused to take the sedative. She also sought to have the Court's order struck. The Court found that the defendant had acted in good faith in the manner in which she operated the vehicle. The plaintiff was not permitted to drive after having an abortion and was found to have suffered from delayed vasovagal reaction. The defendant advised against driving after having the abortion. The court found that there was a recognized risk to driving after the abortion, but that the plaintiff operated the 'Arsenault Vehicle' in a careful and prudent manner. The evidence was admitted to be correct. The only risk was that the patient would have a delayed reaction to the surgery. The doctor's advice was that she was to take medication immediately after the procedure. The physician advised against the use of sedative in the abortion procedure."

The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.

The defendant was entitled to a writ if the tenant failed to supply timely maintenance and timely payment of rent. The plaintiffs were in arrears of rent by more than two months. Hail damage may allow the landlord to claim in damages against the tenant but it cannot be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of The Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled a writ for possession. The court ordered the defendant to pay $5,000 for the first six months of the term of the tenancy.

The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well.

The defendant counterclaimed on the basis that it conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting. The court agreed with Coachlight that the Horizont Well was never contemplated by the Original AFE. The Court found that the defendant was liable for 35% and 35% costs of the Horvizontal Well. The defendants' failure to provide adequate information to the court was not considered by the court. The plaintiffs' failure in obtaining adequate information about the Horovizontal Well was not the only reason the plaintiff was unable to proceed. The failure of the second leg of the drilling was the reason the Court held that the plaintiff had not been awarded the full operating losses of the joint interest well. The default was never considered by Coachlight. The parties' failure not to provide sufficient information to obtain accurate information about their oil recoveries from the Horivant well bore did not disqualify the defendant from proceeding with the second half of the operation. The Company's failure to comply with the default notice was not a reason to refuse to pay. The company's failure in providing adequate information was not an excuse for failure to pay costs."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act. The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act. 1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage. 2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader. 3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act. The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant, Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo), on December 1, 1999. The plaintiff claimed the sale price was $37,000. The balance of the balance of payment was paid in full upon delivery. The defendant denied the claim. Costs were awarded to the defendant. The plaintiffs claim was dismissed. The defendants were both concerned that the plaintiff refused to have his equipment shipped to the factory to be examined and repaired. The trial judge correctly instructed himself that the onus of proving a breach was upon the party asserting its breach. The subtle shifting back and forth of onus argued for by the appellant is not present in the statute. The court found that the defendant had not established to its satisfaction that the Spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in the Act. The Court found that although the plaintiff had not proven the Spreaders was not unfit for the purposes of spreading, nor manufactured, in compliance, the plaintiff was not given the opportunity to take corrective action.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused had been previously arrested and charged with trafficking, crack cocaine contrary. The police had previously conducted a similar search of his vehicle, but this time, they had located the accused's stolen vehicle. The search was conducted in a private area and was relatively quick and invasive. The arrestee was not aware of the location of the stolen vehicle and the search was not conducted to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. The officer who conducted the search had no prior knowledge of the vehicle or its owner. The officers had not been aware of its owner's location. The evidence was not part of the trial proper. The Court found that the strip search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent loss or loss of drugs and was not arbitrary. The court found that significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person. The strip search of the accused was specifically related to the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest of the youth. The fact that the accused had a vehicle matched the owner's description of the owner of the car and the fact that he had been seen driving around the area where the cocaine was found was not relevant to the decision to search the vehicle."

He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.",The accused was found guilty of sexual assault of his son. The accused had pled guilty to the charge of sexual assaulting. The Crown alleged that the accused had videotaped the accused's videotaped interview and that the Crown had not shown the video of the accused making the allegation to the accused. The Court found that the evidence was not credible and that there was a language issue preventing the accused from having a full understanding of the alleged offence.

The documents had words, phrases or numbers that had no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected. The Court also directed that the Crown provide updated Criminal Records for each counsel for the accused until the trial is complete. The court ordered that the documents be made available to counsel and to Crown counsel in sealed envelopes. The original packet of documents filed by the Crown will be retained by the Court until the completion of the trial.

The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop.

At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 and s. 255(1(b) of The Code. The accused had consumed four or five drinks and there was no other observable sign of impairment. The police stopped the accused and asked him to provide sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the officer did not return to the accused to check the driver's licence, the matter was abandoned. The officer did return to his residence to check his computer and produce his driver's license. When that was not done, the accused was transported to his home in Carlyle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Crown did not enjoy an unfettered discretion. The standard of review was set forth in R. v. Helm, [1986] S.C.R. 383 at paras. 19 and 20. The Court reviewed the facts and circumstances and the law and found that the accused had not exercised his right to consult counsel of his choice. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The court found that there was a serious breach of the accused's Charter rights and that the officer acted in a negligent manner in failing to fully comprehend the accused’s right to counsel. The fact that the trial judge did not fail to address the factors, and correctly apply the test, did not result in an error of law. The error of judgment was compounded by the fact that there were no errors of law and there were not errors of fact."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused was also charged with possession of child pornography contrary to ss. 486(4) and s. 153(1)(d) of the Code. She was also found to have possessed a cell phone and computer with which she had obtained pictures of herself and her son. The search of the computer was conducted immediately after the arrest and without further authorization or authorization as required by the issuing justice. The court found that the ITO was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing section of the Charter, and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The Court found that there was no evidence obtained by the accused that the pictures were of sexual nature and that the search of her computer was not authorized. The evidence was not presented to the Court as a result of the voir dire. The ITO did not permit further searches of the accused's computer. The only evidence obtained was that of a dispute of parents and previous allegations against the accused. The defence argued that the court should have considered the nature of the photographs, the nature and content of the pictures, the age of consent, the sex of the child, the manner in which the pictures had been taken and the manner of the photos were displayed. The respondent was found to be the father of the minor child and the father was not involved in the search. The affidavit was also not supported by the evidence. The trial judge found that although the accused had a right to privacy, she was not entitled to the protection of her right to remain in her home and that she was entitled to a wide range of rights, including the right to counsel, which she stated she wished to exercise. The child was not permitted to have access to the computer as she was under the age-16. The application of the Court found the ITOs to be invalid and the search was unlawful. The warrant was therefore invalid. The facts set out in the ITo were not explained or commented upon by the officer involved. The fact that the respondent had a computer with a number of different pictures and that there were no relevant pictures of the alleged offence was not a fatal issue. The conclusion that the Court was unable to determine the validity of the warrant by a justice acting judicially was not supported. The issue was whether the ITOO could have been held to determine whether the search warrant was valid. The issues were whether the respondent could have obtained the necessary information to obtain the search warrants, either because"

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","Defendants This is an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act on behalf of the vendors/persons for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants is without merit. The vendors and their predecessors in title have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. The evidence submitted by the vendors and the plaintiffs' daughters is so remote as to be frivolous and as such is not a valid objection to the title. HELD: 1)The evidence submitted is so strong that even if the possessory titles were established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years this would not defeat the claim by the Crown under the Limitation of Actions Act. 2)The respondent's claim is so far proven that the vendors have established an open, notorious and continuous possessory ownership to the land in question for a period in excess of 44 years. 3)The court has expressed conflicting views as to whether possessory property may properly be determined under the Act. The issue is whether the vendors' claim is without a valid objection. 4)The vendors and purchasers' claim was so remote that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the exact location of the missing feet to which the Crown must lay claim in order to defeat the present possessory claim. 5)The petitioner's claim was not dismissed. 6)The Court has expressed contradictory views as whether possessories may properly exist under the act. The Court has held conflicting views on whether possessor title may properly determine under the Listed Actions Act in order for a claim of ownership.

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped at an intersection for several southbound vehicles to go by. Before he turned left, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. He made a left turn and was unable to avoid the collision. The accused vehicle was unable or unwilling to yield and the defendant's vehicle came into collision. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing not to yield. 1)The accused was not above the legal limit in failing to observe the defendant. The court found that the defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. The offence of speeding was equivocal. The evidence of the drivers and their passengers and to all of the circumstances was that the accused was entitled, when he commenced his turn across the path of the Tempo, to assume it was a safe to proceed as there were no other vehicles nearby to present an immediate hazard. 2)The defendant was acquitted of all charges. The Court found that he did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failing to report, the defence of due diligence was established."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) The application to be appointed personal decision making and property guardians is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. 2) Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so. Leave is given to the applicant to request more than one bond be given in order to limit the liability of surety to an amount that the court considers reasonable. 3) The applicant is from out of the Province and is not a beneficiary under the dependent adult's will. If the applicant was from out-of-province, or was not beneficiary under his or her dependent adult’s will, then the court application may be brought. 4) The court has the power under s47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship that it considers appropriate, and may also require the property guardian to have the appointment reviewed within specified period of time. This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a Bond contained in s55(1). 5) Leave to supplement existing material is granted. Leave may be granted to appoint personal decision makers should they wish to do it. 6) The Court has the authority under s45(1) to order an order with the Authorities identified in draft order. 7) The Application to be Appointed Personal Decision-Making and Property Guardian is in the order provided in the Draft Order submitted. 8) Leave for the applicants is granted in the circumstances with the result the court is prepared to consent to the application."

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.

Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant appealed his decision to amend his action to add a new defendant to his existing claim against the municipality for negligence. He argued that the Rules gave the judge discretion to grant the amendment and that the judge should have granted it. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; leave to appeal allowed; the appellant was granted leave to renew the application. The appeal was allowed; and the judge's order dismissing the application was set aside. The respondent appealed. He contended that the rules gave the court a discretion to make the amendment, and that it erred in thinking that he had no authority to do so.

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The defendant and the sole director of the company were convicted of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant and his sole director, the sole Director, each were fined and ordered to pay a surcharge.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","The appellant bank appealed the Chambers decision. The Chambers judge held that the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against the mortgage balance. The respondent sought an order for solicitor-client costs to be set aside. The appellant appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the appeal allowed; and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants. The court found that the appellant bank had not advanced the proper amount of the deficiency judgment. The appeal was allowed with respect to the amount and amount of interest payable against the purchase money portion of the loan; the respondent accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. HELD: The appeal is allowed with regard to the portion of sale proceeds that should be used against the loan and the balance owing on the non-purchase money portion. The decision accords the respondent with the Policy behind the Legislation as set in this case. The Court found that s. 25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the purchase and non-Purchase money portions of the debt and the proceeds from the sale of the land to be used to sue for the balance.  1) The appellant bank was found to be the controlling authority in this matter. The balance owed by the appellant was $536,186.72. 2) The appeal of the respondent bank was allowed in respect to its portion of a loan which was $345,000. The sale proceeds were applied against a portion of its purchase money debt. The proceeds of the net sale proceeds (which includes accrued interest) were to be paid to the respondent. The remaining non-pupped money debt was credited against the $18,770.48 leaving balance of $18.48. The order below was varied to entitle the respondent to take the respondent out of the $31.160 judgment in respect of the balance owed. 3) The court considered the decision of Hrynewich Holdings in relation to the land purchase and the nonpurchase-money portion of debt. Hrynich Holdings accords well with the legislation behind the statute as set set out earlier in this court. HRYNICHICH Holdings accredits the policy of the legislation."

Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed.",The appellant and respondent both claim title to or ownership of a portion of meadowland abutting the Margaree River and containing approximately six acres. The respondent claims title to the disputed lands under the Quieting Titles Act. The appellant claims title under the Act to certain lands including the six acres in dispute. The dispute between the respondent and the appellant involves a conventional line dividing the land from the Crown land to the meadowlands in dispute and the existence of a conventional one-half of the land in dispute which would result in the respondent having title extinguished by possession of the said lands by himself alone and in privity with others in possession. The appellants argue that the line dividing their lands from the crown land in question was a straight line and the acreage shortfall sustained by the appellant was due to the bend in the river. The applicant argues that the same line is the one that separated the Crown lands from those of the respondent. HELD: The appellant appeals. The evidence more than amply supports the trial judge's decision and the order of the trial court. The trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under s.5 of the Quietings Titles act and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said land in any way whatsoever. The application for a certificate was dismissed. The appeal was dismissed with costs.

If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The parties were married for 43 years and had two children. The petitioner sought custody and spousal support and division of matrimonial property. The respondent applied to reduce the interim support and granted interim maintenance. The parties agreed to pay the respondent $400 per month and $800 per month for the maintenance of the children. An application by the respondent to reduce interim support was denied. The mother applied to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount outstanding. The court ordered that a kind of specified access should be ordered. The husband counter-petitioned in January 1992. The wife's assets were divided into three sections. The assets were to be divided equally. The father was to pay $800 for the children's food and clothing and $400 for the child's maintenance. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The children's beneficial interest was sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. The land was purchased in 1985 for $75,000. There is no basis upon which spousals can be reduced below $400. The child's diabetes alone costs her up to $200 every month. The evidence did not allow for lessening of the monthly payment of $400 to the mother. The Court ordered that the parties pay the sum of $800 and $300 per month to the petitioner. The amount payable to the respondent was to be placed in the petitioner's name solely. If the sum is not paid by the wife by September 1st next, the she may apply to the Court for a Sale of the Land to facilitate the payment ofthe amount then outstanding. An order for a kindof specified access was ordered."

At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant and the insurance companies that had paid her for the loss of income from employment.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff was acting expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the basis of the representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. The insurance companies argued that this was an appropriate response to the plaintiff's claim. The court found that the defendants acted expeditously to comply and to provide the plaintiff with income replacement. The plaintiffs claim that the insurance company was estopping from claiming repayment. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to the full benefit of the $140 she earned from her employment. 1)The defendant acted expedidiously to provide an income replacement to the deceased. The deceased was not employed at the time of the accident. The applicant was not aware that there was a possibility that she would have to pay the benefits back. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to any benefit under Schedule B. The defendants acted erratically to comply on the part of the insurer to provide information to the applicant. The information was not available at the plaintiff’s time of discovery.

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired. The Crown had withdrawn a count and the accused was convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. The accused was given a certificate of qualified medical practitioner as opposed to a doctor's certificate. The certificate was signed by the doctor. The doctor testified that he had received the certificate from the doctor and that he was advised that the accused would be kept in hospital. The officer testified that the doctor had advised him that the time of the accident was near the hospital and that the blood sample was taken from the accused. The medical practitioner testified that she had seen the accused walk out of the hospital with his hands up and his eyes bloodshot. The physician testified that his opinion that the taking of the blood samples would not endanger his life or health was not accepted. The Court found that the medical practitioner had no reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand, and that his evidence was not supported by the evidence at trial. The evidence at the trial was that the officer had not received the doctor's signature on the certificate. HELD: The Court held that the facts were in the officer's mind at the time he decided to make this demand, that the evidence was in the doctor’s home and that there was no evidence that the physician had informed the officer that the decision was made.

7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties separated in 1998. The petitioner sought to have access, child support, spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property. The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. HELD: 1)The marriage breakdown was established. The respondent was ordered to convey 1/2 of the commuted value as of the date of the petition to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The wife sought adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs and insurance costs incurred after the date, with respect to minimum monthly payments made on the Canada Trust Powerline loan. The court found that the amount of spousa maintenance payable by the respondent was $900 per month. The amount of the spousals awarded was 73 percent. 2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. Maintenance for the petitioner was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 3)The parties agreed that the respondent would have to contribute his proportionate share of the part of orthodontic treatment expenses for the wife that is not covered by insurance. The Court found that this was an unfair and inequitable result so as to require compilation at a different date."

The mother appealed the decision of the Nova Scotia Superior Court judge, who had previously allowed the father's variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. Appeal allowed; the Nova Scotian Appeal allowed in part; the Court's decision was procedurally unfair to the mother and wrong in principle; only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support obligation be heard absent that party making full disclosure. The Court erred in hearing the father’s application to reduce the amount by reducing the amount to $7,000 and confirming the considerable deficit.

As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.",The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that he had tried to evade the officer when he stopped for him. The defence argued that the accused had not shown a reasonable excuse for not stopping and that his blood-alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court of Appeal held that the defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption. The issue was whether the accused was drinking enough alcohol to warrant a stop and whether he had a reasonable explanation for not turning on his emergency lights. The Crown argued that there was no reasonable excuse and that the officer was acting erratically. The officer testified that he did not notice the accused drinking alcohol but that he noticed that the alcohol in the accused’s blood was in his blood stream when he was stopped. The evidence of the RCMP officer was not satisfied. The court accepted the defence’ s argument that the offence was committed because the accused “wanted to reach his driveway where he would not have his truck seized”. The only issue was if the accused could have reasonably been found to have a reasonable reason for not continuing to stop. The offence was not committed because he was concerned about losing his licence or having his vehicle seized by virtue of the officer’’S powers under the Traffic Safety Act. The fact that the Crown had not obtained a breath sample and the accused did not appear to have had a valid excuse for failing to comply with the stop was not sufficient to warrant an arrest. The test results were not sufficient. The trial judge found that the evidence of both the RCMP and the defence was not credible. The issues were whether the defence offered a credible explanation of the offence and whether the offence itself was an excuse for failure to stop and the fact that there were no reasonable explanations for the accused not being able to get out of the vehicle and that there had been no reasonable explanation as to why he had not stopped sooner. The facts were not supported by the evidence. The judge found the accused to have been acting errately and the evidence was not supported. The appellant’d been drinking alcohol for the past two days and was concerned that his Class licence would be stolen if left by the

The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arises. The Queen's bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The appellant was not adding the need for specific conversation. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of sexual favours was contemplated. If the Provincial court judge had found that under s 213 the actuses reus must include a specific phrase specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for, she was incorrect."

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had deliberately steered his truck between an automobile and a stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury to her. The defendant applied for summary judgment, arguing that s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, but does not result in the victim not being compensated for personal injuries incurred as a result of an automobile. HELD: A declaration that the plaintiff was precluded by s. 102 of the act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There was no order as to costs. 1)The wording in s.103 of the legislation is indistinguishable from the wording in the wording of s.143(1) of the Vehicles Act, 1983. No action may be brought against person for the recovery of damages occasioned by motor vehicle after 12 months. 2)The plaintiff's damages were assessed in the total amount of $37,717.35. The wording in S.102(a) of The Act is indistinguishable. The same result is dictated by Herbert v. Misuga: the plaintiff had no cause of action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile; the plaintiff's injuries having caused a blood-spattered brain injury, permanent physical or mental impairment or death. 3)The statutory limitation as to commencement of assault actions was applied rather than s.142(1)(a) in The Vehicle Act, which applied. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion, and stated that the limitation period in s 143(1(a)(a)) of The Vehicles Act applied."

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced to the defendant by counterclaim for expenses it incurred because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses arising out the defendant's unjustified termination of the contract and for services it performed under the contracted contract and as extras, and for which it has never been paid. The plaintiff/Defendant brought this action, claiming reimbursement of the monies received under the tender, and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of its failure to perform the contract, and as an added charge. The defendants counterclaimed damages arising from losses arising from the defendant/plaintiff's unjustification termination of contract and expenses it claims it suffered as a result of the contractual obligation to maintain the banks, ditches, railway tracks and roadways. The court found that the defendant was entitled to reimbursement for monies it had advanced to Roper under the original tender and for expenses incurred because the failure was not recognized as being the contract between the parties. The contract was also subject to a special condition that the plaintiff pay interest on the monied monies paid to the defendants under the previous tender and as Extras, and that the court found the defendant not to be entitled to the monieurs advanced under the prior tender and that it was entitled only to the amount of monied received by the defendant and the plaintiff/platteur as extras and for the amount it was never paid."

The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

She considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent had spent time in remand as mitigating factors. She was of the view community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the respondent. The Crown appealed. HELD: The sentence was reduced to a sentence of three to four years. The sentence should have been increased sooner as the respondent was already in danger of committing the offences. The community had supported the respondent throughout his time on the remand and the respondent did so well on probation that he was released early at his own request in December. The judge considered a negative pre--sentencing report and fact the offender spent time spent on remond. She also considered a community disposition which was likely more effective. The court noted the community support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training and the time spent in remond had not been ignored. The Court noted that the community had not stopped the respondent from committing the offence. The offender was in danger because of his alcohol problem and had not completed his probation. The public must be aware of the gravity of the offence and the need for protection. The respondent was in a position to make a complete recovery. The fact that he spent time remand did not make it easy to understand the gravity and gravity of his offence was not ignored. A sentence of this length must be considered sooner."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","FIAT: The plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant to the Class Actions Act as am. (the 'Act') as am and now represented by an amended Statement of Claim filed with the Court November 7, 2008. Each of the defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's action commenced pursuant pursuant to The Class Actions act as am as am (the “Act” or “Sask. Act”) as am with respect to the Saskatchewan action. The Saskatchewan action is a multi-jurisdictional class action and involves a number of potentially significant and potentially life-threatening injuries. The plaintiff commenced his class action in Saskatchewan when the Saskatchewan Act was enacted. The original defendants commenced a third party claim against the second defendant by notice dated June 2008. The second defendant commenced a fourth claim in Saskatchewan in November 2008. Both the Saskatchewan and New Brunswick action commenced in New Brunswick in November 2009. The third defendant applied to stay on either an interim or permanent basis, as am, the Saskatchewan Action as am; the Saskatchewan actions are a multijuritime class action as am or as am represented by the Saskatchewan Statement of Claims. The Sask. Action is a representative of a class of persons residing in each province and territory. The plaintiffs are specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the Court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.

8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. The mother had suggested that he would take her away from her current residence and that she was concerned that the child would model aggressive and controlling behaviour in his relationships with others. The Father had not responded to the mother's request for an inquiry into the circumstances of the incident. The Mother had not indicated that she would allow the Father to take the child out of the home. The evidence did not support her position that the Father had actually harmed her. The court found that the father had acted reasonably in allowing the mother to have access but that the evidence did suggest that the relationship was not stable. The Court ordered that the mother attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child.
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the Chambers Judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Given the state of the evidence before the chambers judge, evidence which was partially inadmissible, largely contradictory and materially deficient, we are all of the view there was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. 2) Given that the Chambers court found that the father's evidence regarding the wishes of the children could not be used to support his request for shared parenting, there was no factual basis to make an interim order in the issue. The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. The evidence regarding these issues was limited and inconclusive. The chambers judge did not properly consider the principle of maximum contact. This argument cannot be dismissed. 3) Given all the contradictory evidence regarding his wishes and the father’s evidence regarding their wishes, the Chambers decision was not the best way to make a determination. The court found the evidence regarding this principle was limited, inconclusive and irrelevant. The Court of Appeal was unable to draw any conclusions from the evidence. 4) Given a state of evidence before a judge, the material evidence regarding wishes and their ability to be heard was controverted to allow the Chambers to make the best decision. The judge was unable, in the best interests of the parties, to draw a conclusion that the changes in circumstances and the children’ s health and well-being were not adequately addressed by the Chambers judges. The decision was therefore dismissed. The appeal of the father was dismissed. 5) Given this evidence, there is no factual reason to believe that the chambers justice erred in her decision to make this decision."

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had been intoxicated and had not been paying attention to the complainant when he came to visit. The complainant had advised him against drinking and the respondent refused to take the sleeping pill. The appellant was found not guilty. The trial judge found that the appellant had not shown that he intended to assault his wife. He was found guilty of assault contrary to the Criminal Code s.686(4)(b)(ii) of the Code. The wife's evidence indicated the respondent did not have the minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence because his state of awareness was akin to automatism or insanity. The respondent should have been found guilty but for the error in law. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The Court was of the opinion that voluntary intoxication of a person cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to his intent in connection with a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intention to perform it because his level of awareness is akin to that of automatism. 2)The court was of view that intoxication falling short of insanity or automatism is not a defence to crimes of general intent. The defence of voluntary drunkenness has no application in the absence of an evidentiary evidence which points to the cause of the mental incapacity. The Court was also of the view that the trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as result of the appellant's degree of impairment, that there was a reasonable suspicion that the offence of common assault was an assault. 3)The wife's testimony indicated that she had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time although he cannot remember. The'sack of potatoes defence' is not supported by any evidence. 4)The trial judge was of opinion that the Court was not properly directed as to whether the respondent should be found guilty."

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of a spousal maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)The husband was ordered to resume livestock operation on the farm. The division of the balance of the property was postponed to allow him to complete the division of matrimonial property. 2)The wife was to be entitled to the following set-off: $1,100 for February and $1k100 for March. The husband was to pay $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The wife was entitled to $800 for February. 3)The respondent's claim for set-offs was allowed. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the husband had not taken up farming and his financial situation was dismal. The Court granted the wife 56% of the estimated asset value and 44% of his wife's assets. 4)Division of property divided based on the respondent's assets being at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings.

9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an interim injunction restraining the defendants from entering the premises of the defendant and from interfering with the lawful use and improvement of the premises by picketers. The defendants had entered an interim order prohibiting the defendants' entry into the premises and from entering or leaving the premises. The plaintiff sought damages for the loss of property and for damage to the plaintiff's reputation. The defendant refused to pay the damages. The injunction was granted and the defendant's application for an interim restraining order was granted. The court reserved its decision and granted the interim injunction. The Court found that the acts complained of were illegal and were not justified. The respondent's right to trade was exercised for the benefit of particular class only while the right of the defendants to engage in a secondary picketing was exercised solely for the purpose of communicating information. The acts were also unlawful.
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village. The defendants had been the owners of the buildings and land and bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, Plan 83B16092. They had stated that they intended to build a boathouse on public reserves, but that they were not allowed to do so. The municipality had no effective policing mechanism to determine if anyone was violating the landowner's rights under the s. 197 and s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendant had also indicated that he intended to construct a boat house on public reserved land. The plaintiff had refused to allow the boat house to be built on public land. He argued that the bylaws of the resort were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination'. The defendants were also charged with failing to obtain the required written consent from the municipality. The court found that the defendants had not followed the proper procedures and that the municipality had acted out of respect for the law and the public. The Court found that, in the circumstances, the defendants were acting in breach of the s/197 and s/207 of the S. 197 bylaws. The Defendants were charged for permitting a boathouse on public reservas contrary to the provisions and the zoning bylaws and the municipality's claim that they had been permitted to build on the reserve. The accused were charged under s.197 and ss.197. The charges were dismissed. The Municipality stepped into that position. The plaintiffs were charged as being violators of the bylaw and the by-laws of their land. They were also found to have violated the by -law and s-207 of their s.199 bylaws, and the s-197 bylaws as they were in violation of the province's rights as landowner. The Crown was to assume the burden of prosecutions for violations of the provincial bylaws but the defendants would be prosecuted for the same offences. The municipal court found the defendants guilty of violating the s./197 bylaw. The trial was adjourned."

The appellants appealed the decision of the Summary Court judge ordering a fresh trial on the seven counts. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision. He proceeded on the worst case scenario that all payments received by the appellans constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. 2)The trial judge proceeded on a worst case case scenario, that all payment received by appellants constituted income.

The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary or Conviction appeal courts. 3)The Crown is asking this Court to overturn findings of fact made by the trial Judge by arguing the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. Neither the trial court nor the appeal judge were prepared to make such a finding. The appeal judge was not prepared to say the trial was wrong. The trial judge misinterpretated the decision and proceeded on his worst case scenarios, that is that all the payments received were income and first he considered that issue of mens. Thus in our view the trial judges proceeded on that worst case situation, that was that all of payments received received by them constituted income, and then they considered the relevant issue of taxation. Thus, there is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment of taxes, or whether there was any intent to make a statement knowing it to be false or deceptive. The recordkeeping was sloppy. There is no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant could legally have avoided the payment. The tax assessor was prepared to determine the tax liability of the Crown. The evidence was clear that the trial's conclusions were not made in a forum of law and therefore, the tax assessors were not prepared for the evidence."
9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union. The respondent loaned the respondent $16,000 to purchase a mobile house. The Credit Union resisted seizure and an application was brought before the Court of Queen's Bench to find priorities as between the parties. At trial the trial judge concluded that Lanson did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s.28(1) of the PPSSA and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2) of PPSA. The credit union appeals this decision. HELD: The issue is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale and if he was not authorized, did he sell the mobile house in the extraordinary course of the business as intended by s30(3). The Credit union appeals. 1) Section 28(1)(c) contemplates the secured creditor (Lanson) authorizing the debtor to deal with the secured debtor. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The trial judge found that Landon, the secured party had to authorize the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking, to deal, and that the buyer must know of the authorization. The Court of Appeal found that the priority in a security home granted by the respondent contemplates a secured creditor authorizing the creditor to deal and does not consider an authorization a thirdparty to deal the collateral. The critical issue is if the authorization was subject to a pre-requisite of payment. The issue here is whether Lanson authorized the selling of the home as contemplated s. 28(2), and the proceeds of the sale. The failure of the Credit union to seize the mobilehome does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 2) The CreditU appeals this appeal. The question on this issue is the Priority of Security Interest in a Mobile Home granted by Lanson to the applicant and subsequent purchasers for value. The relationship between the respondent's security and the CreditU is not in dispute. The only issue is that the respondent has the right to sell the home. The issues are whether the agreement or the conduct of the respondent takes priority over the security interest of the credit union. The balance of probabilities is whether a secured party authorized the sales of the property. The key issue is how the authorization should be given before the sale, and whether"

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant, who was the defendant's uncle, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act.

She had even seen the defendant’s uncle’d written an affidavit, which she had filed in 1997. She testified that she had been informed by her uncle that the defendant had been the driver of the vehicle at the time of the fatality.

9_1999canlii2477.txt,"The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike. The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear. The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Labour Relations Board denying it the opportunity to strike out the respondent's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The appellant had been on the board since 1971 and had been a member for twenty years. The respondent had operated a hotel in Dartmouth and had received complaints of unfair labour practices against the appellant. The appellants had brought a motion to strike the respondent’s statement of claims under the Trade Union Act. The Chambers judge had previously struck out the appellant’ s statement of claiming under the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that the statement of claimed discloses no reasonable cause of action. The applicant had not satisfied that it was plain and obvious that the respondent disclosed no reasonable causes of action and would therefore dismiss the application. The appeal was allowed in part on the grounds that there was no abuse of process based on the principle of res judicata. The applicants had not shown that the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike. The issue of whether the respondent discloses a reasonable cause is not a multifarious matter at least not to the extent of being frivolous and vexatious. All appear to the court to be sincerely designed to seek redress of alleged wrongs. The Court declined to strike either. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court held that the appeal was not made lightly and that the application for strike was not a matter of multifarious proceedings at least in the extent that it is not frivolous and was not vexatiously vexatous."

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 19-year-old child. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the child would be premature but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. There is nothing in s.487.06 which can in my view fairly be said to suggest that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which sample is not in the possession of the Crown and which remains in the child's child's body, is in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. There are a number of significant deficiencies in the Informations In Support which would need to be remedied if further consideration were given to the applications."

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with assault with a weapon contrary to S. 267(a) of The Highway Traffic Act. The accused was stopped on a highway near Kindersley, Saskatchewan, for a traffic stop. The officer observed that the accused was driving a vehicle with a cracked tail light and that she was trying to get her driver's licence and registration out of the vehicle. The police observed that there was a small child in the back seat of the accused's vehicle covered in blankets and there was also a red bag with duct tape in the middle of the bag. The child was crying and the officer observed the red bag in the rear of the car. The Crown proceeded against the accused on five counts. The first count was that the officer smelled marijuana in the accused’s vehicle. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact that the police only made use of a light after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the vehicle, which was not a vehicle. HELD: The Court found that the evidence obtained after the initial stop was not of reasonable and probable grounds. The Court held that the Court found the following: 1) The evidence obtained in this case was not reasonable and was excluded pursuant to s24(2). The Court concluded that the use of the flashlight was not justified. 2) The Court did not believe that the appellant’ s s. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed. The evidence was excluded because it did not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and likely grounds. 3) The court found that all evidence obtained post-stopping was not necessary to establish prima facie grounds."

The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference.

9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders made by the Board of Trade in response to a complaint by the union. The order required the applicant to produce documents referred to in the subpoena duces tecum and documents regarding the operational status of store departments and the concept of 'Store within Store'. The applicant sought to have the subpoena removed from the record. The applicant brought a writ of certiorari pursuant to Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982. The application was contested by the applicant and by certain Wal-Mart Canada employees who were designated by the board asInterested Parties. The applications were brought by the respondent to delay and fragment the hearings to the jeopardy of the applicant's application for certification. The respondent brought a motion to strike the orders. The motion was granted and the hearing was adjourned for a further two days. The parties argued that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record as well. The respondents were to present their evidence of alleged breaches of the Charter rights and the right to due process. The Board refused to issue the subpoena and the subpoen. The plaintiff brought a written decision that the Board should not have jurisdiction to order discovery and production of documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts. The court found that the respondent had not followed the proper procedure in making the disclosure and production orders. It ordered the applicant produce the documents referred in the subpoen duces, and that the documents contained therein were to be considered as part of its record. It also ordered that the applicant comply with the subpoena in the manner in which it had done so. The plaintiffs brought an application for discovery and document production pursuant to s. 24 of Part I, Part II of the Canada act, 1982. It was also ordered to produce the portions of the subpoena referred to by the appellant in para. 1, 2, and 3, and to provide written decision respecting the scope of discovery and the production of the documents sought by the parties. The Court found that a judicial review of a subpoena is not the only avenue to achieve the goal of discovery. The issues raised in the application were whether the legislature intended the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal, and whether the Board was able to use the subpoena or make the disclosure or production orders in the way it has done.

The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant plead not guilty to driving while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

The adjudicator rejected the appellant's evidence of only one Crown witness, a police officer, and three other civilian witnesses, including the appellant inter alia indicated he was not the driver of the vehicle and the other witnesses indicated he did. The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. In R. v. Biniaris, the Court of Queen's Bench reviewed the jurisprudence on the standard of review in summary conviction appeals at paras. 14 and 15 of the decision and concluded that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. The Appeal Court appealed. Appeal Court judge accepted the appellant and the three other corroborating witnesses over that of the appellant. The Crown's witness, who was also a police witness, was not involved in the adjudicator's analysis of the evidence and was not engaged in the analysis of whether the appellant was the driver. The decision of the adjudicating officer was not made lightly. The evidence of the Crown's witnesses was clearly capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The judge failed to address the issue of whether there was a critical issue to be addressed in this case."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order.

There is no denial that the Board's order was biased against the less fortunate. The respondent had not followed its obligations to disclose the police files to the board. The fact that the respondent had refused to disclose certain police files did not disqualify him from proceeding with the appeal. The applicant had not demonstrated that he could deal with the nuisance. The court found that the evidence did not support the board’s conclusion that there was a nuisance to the building. The appellant had not shown that the city had not interfered with his right to appeal."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant sought to have the Court of Appeal strike out or stay his application for a community safety order under the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act on the grounds that the applicant was trafficking. The Chambers judge dismissed the application on the provisional basis that there was authority to appeal in ss. and of the Courtof Appeal Act, 2000 and on the premise that the decision of the Queen's Bench Chambers judge was made in the context of Queen's' Bench Rule 173 and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The applicant appealed on the basis that the order being appealed was in the nature of a procedural order under Queen's B Bench Rule173 and/ or the inherent ability of the Supreme Court to prevent abuse of process. The Court of appeal dismissed the appeal on the issue of identity of issue. The jurisdiction to hear the appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss. 7 and 8 of The Courtof Appeals Act, and on a balance of fairness and justice. The court must still decide whether fairness is better achieved by applying issue estoppel, or by refusing to apply it. The application for an order for possession under the RTA and for CSO is the removal of a tenant for failure to comply with certain of certain rights given to landlords under the Act. The respondent applies to be added as a party to the proceedings under Queen’s Bench Rule 73. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The jurisdiction to appeal can only be found where there was a procedural or procedural order (such as a procedural one under Queen/B Bench Rule 163 and/OR the inherent authority of the SCAN) and the inherent remedy of the courts to strike out the application (which is to be exercised in the circumstances of this case). 2)The Court of Queen‘s Bench rule 173(e) and its inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of the process is not exercised. The chambers judge reviewed the governing law respecting abuse of processes and its purpose of insuring that the administration of justice is not brought into disrepute. The provisions of the Act both prohibit interlocutory applications which have the effect of preventing an order and confer only a limited right of appeal of determination under SCAN. The Director argues that this Court is not limited by any provisions of SCAN because the application before the Hearing Officer originated as a Rule 173(E) application and an application pursuant to s. of SCan. The purpose of the Director’ s. 7(3) is to prevent unfairness by preventing abuse of"
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant had no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The accused did not deny that he had sex with the complainant and claimed that the activity was consensual or alternatively, that he lacked the mens rea for sexual assault. The Crown called three witnesses, the complainant's mother, her uncle and her uncle. The mother testified that she had no recollection of the event due to the alcohol induced blackout. The father testified that he drove the accused to her house and asked if there was a place where they could 'be together' and that she could'sleep together'. The accused testified that his daughter had been drinking and that he told her that he would ask her if she had a spare room. The daughter testified that the accused had asked her if there were places where she could sleep and she said that she did not remember. The trial judge found the accused not guilty. The evidence raised reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent and that her level of intoxication. The defence witnesses testified that they had no idea what the complainant was thinking when they picked her up and she told them that she was not happy. The Court found that the complainant had not been able to communicate with the accused beyond a reasonable doubt that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. The court found that both the complainant, who had no clear recollection of what happened and the accused, who testified that there was no clear understanding of her level or intoxication, had not taken adequate steps to communicate beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt. The judge found that although the complainant may have had difficulty communicating with the father due to her level and intoxication, she was able to express her level, if not express it, beyond a very reasonable doubt, that she supported the accused’ s honest but mistaken belief in consent."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.",The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused had been attending to conduct a search for a possible impaired driver when she was approached by the accused. The officer observed that the accused was impaired and that she had to ask the accused what brand of cigarettes she thought was strange. The police officer followed the accused around the house and observed her around the home and around the residence. The complainant put the child in a car seat in the back of the vehicle and the accused put the vehicle in the car seat. The Crown argued the officer went to the house for the purpose of securing evidence for a crime and to get evidence to support the grounds for impaired driving; the accused's lawyer advised her that the officer was not going to the home for the purposes of securing the evidence for the offence but rather to get a better look at the accused’s speech and actions. The defence argued the unreasonable search contrary to s. 8 was unnecessary because the accused had not asked the officer in and as the police officer’d accompanying her around and around her home and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood were serious. The Court found the officer”s conduct egregious and found the Charter breach was serious.

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT. The wife applied for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The wife was granted interim spouse support of $500 per month. The husband was ordered to take out loan to pay an interim amount. The court reviewed the factors that led to the application and found that the wife had not demonstrated a need for support. The Court directed that the husband pay the wife $500 as interim spouses and an additional $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. The Wife argued that this was not a situation where the net assets far exceeded the amount requested. The respondent argued that the net asset value of the property was $74,174. The petitioner sought an order in the order of $2000 per monthly to equalise the gross income of the spouses. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines were not applied. The spouse argued that there was a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post-separation period and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in affordability of lifestyles of the current spouses. HOLD: The Court found that there were no significant disparities in the net worth of the respondent's property and that the respondent was entitled to spousa in the amounts of $5,000 and $2k per month for the duration of the spousas. The applicant was ordered by the Court to take the respondent out of the Spousa Maintenance Act and pay $500 to the wife. The Judge also ordered that the parties pay the husband $500 in interim spurs and $1,100 in interim support commencing in June 2016. The parties were involved in a spousousal relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband had a prior relationship for whom he pays support. HAND: The respondent was ordered not to consume any capital, save for the child support obligations. The spousals were appropriate. The spouses had no other assets available to them at the time of separation. The net assets for distribution far exceeded their amount requested and the husband was entitled by default to spouse and share in the interim distribution. The amount of spousol support should provide both of the ex-spousal spouses with an immediate standard of living which more closely relates to that of each other and to the standard of life experienced by both before their separation. Where there is a significant difference in the parties' incomes, the economic disparity defined"

HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.",This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act. The applicants had filed an affidavit for garnishee summons which was inconsistent with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The application to set aside the garnishees was dismissed. 1)The applicants had clearly shown that they had a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. 2)The application for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishees was premature. 3)The Court had previously set aside a judgment by default pursuant to s. 14(1) of The Association of Debt Servicing pursuant to Rule 442 of The Act. 4)The court had previously held that no order for payment was made for the garnishment of any monies paid into the court by a garnisee when a garnisheesummons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff had recovered a judgment against the defendant.
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel which reinstated the respondent as an employee of the applicant. The respondent took the position that the mutual agreement was what is colloquially referred to as a last chance agreement. Based on this agreement and the evidence at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. HELD: The respondent was reinstated to his former position immediately. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months. 1)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreements with respect to clause 10 was correct. 2)The respondent's testimony that he was'stressed out' was consistent with previous actions such as quitting when faced with garnishee summons at work and two weeks sentence at St. Louis. 3)The penalty imposed by the respondent was a suspended without pay of approximately 16 months and was not discharge."

The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46 year old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of a motor vehicle. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim were resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff was injured. The Court had previously resolved the issue of causation by having the expert on the motor vehicle accident testify as expert on a number of medical issues. The expert on injuries to the lower back was not called to testify. The court had previously referred to the expert as an orthopaedic surgeon. The evidence of the expert was not available. The plaintiff had not received any medical treatment prior to the collision. The accident was not the cause of her injuries. The only evidence that the plaintiff suffered from back pain was that of a fall event. The impact of the collision was felt in the lower body and caused no visible physical damage to either vehicle. The injury was not caused by the defendant. The two expert witnesses testified as expert witnesses. The first expert was a licensed medical practitioner and member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not qualified to give an opinion as to causation of the injury. The second expert was an orthopedic surgeon and his expertise as a medical doctor was limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports. The third expert was also not called at trial.

b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.",The court held that the debt owing under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) was a conditional one and made so by reason of assignment. It did not conclude that the garnishability of the debt owed under a promissory note was prevented because the debt is a conditional 'debt' and made due by reason that the default judgment was not yet due. The court also held that garnishment was prevented by reference only to garnishable promissor notes not yet owing.
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent with Allstate Insurance. The plaintiff had been with the company for 26 years. The defendant had previously offered him a position as an insurance agent in a small company. The termination of the plaintiff's employment agreement provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month and renewal compensation calculated using average renewals. The contract also provided for relocation counselling services. The court found that the plaintiff had made little effort to secure alternative employment. The Court found that since the plaintiff was entitled to lengthier periods of notice, he was not entitled to compensation for the loss of employment."

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving the proceeds from future proceeds from those properties. HELD: The application was granted. The court held that the plaintiffs had not met the first and second tests and that the applicants' assertion of irreparable harm would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Court found that the respondents had not established a'very strong probability' that grave damage would accrue to them in the future. The applicants had not demonstrated a'strong probability' upon the facts that grave damages would accrue to them. The application for a mandatory injunction was dismissed. The plaintiff must prove a very strong probability upon the fact that grave harm will accrue in the near future."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.",The plaintiff claimed damages for the loss of a motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the vehicle under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court found that SGE had not expressly elected to reinstate the vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that the statutory condition of the insurance policy is that the insurer is responsible for the entire cost of repairs. The claim is not made against SGE under the terms of the policy. The only issue is whether SGI has elected to re-open the vehicle and whether it has elected not to reinstall. The issue here is whether the insurer elected to do so under statutory conditions 8(5) of The Automobile Act. The defendant argued that the reinstatement clause was not an election under which it was bound to reinstitute. The action was dismissed for reimbursement. The parties' claim for depreciation was not dismissed.

The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action.

The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.",FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the defendants statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of defense of the defendant. The defendants had not paid their share of assessments against all unit owners and the issues raised raised raised were not susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The issues raised did not appear susceptible of resolving on a summarily or on a whole basis. The issues raised were resolved on the merits. 2)The defendants had registered a mortgage against condominium unit number 14 and the defendant registered a condominium against it. The issue raised was whether the defendants' charge against condo unit number 15 took priority over all encumbrances. 3)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. 4)The application was therefore dismissed with the costs to defendants in the event of a cause of action.

She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v.

Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff was induced to labour by caesarian section.

She underwent surgery to remove the remaining products of conception which had been removed by a dilation and curettage procedure. She later underwent surgery for haemorrhaging which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysterectomy. The hystectomy was never performed as the plaintiff alleged. The hospital records were examined and the results of the surgery were conclusive. The only medical opinion that was of any real relevance was that of the physician who performed the surgery. The physician's credibility was challenged on the issue of whether he actually performed the D & C, a procedure which would have remedied the bleeding and obviate the necessity for performing the surgery, and the fact that the bleeding subsequently recurred. The doctors were not called to explore any possibility of error."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The respondent was convicted of two counts of sexual assault and incest over a period of seven years. The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge, which held that the Crown had jurisdiction in the proceedings, because some of the offences alleged to have occurred when the respondent was a young person and the accused was an adult. The respondent appealed the conviction on the grounds that the youth court judge was unable to determine whether the alleged offences occurred when he was a youth. Appeal allowed; the respondent appealed; the trial judge should have assumed jurisdiction after he found the alleged offence could have occurred in a young or adult court but it was not possible to determine if the accused person was a youthful person or an adult at the time of the alleged crimes. The trial judge could have assumed the jurisdiction after the Crown alleged the same offences could have happened when he became an adult but he or she should decline jurisdiction and transfer the case to adult court. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth judge should assume jurisdiction after determining the alleged acts could have taken place when the accused is either a young, or an old person. The secondary issue is whether a writ of mandamus should issue. HELD: The respondent was found guilty. The matter was remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). In the circumstances, either party may apply to a youth court Judge for an order under s.16 of the Act to determine the proper forum to hear the charges. The issues are whether the respondent should be tried in youth court, because the offences could possibly have occurred while he was young person or when he ceased to be a young offender. The issue is if the respondent is unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred and as a result alleges that it or they occurred over a time which includes when the appellant was a child, the secondary issue of whether a Writ of Mandamus should be issued. The court reviewed the factors that could be considered in determining jurisdiction and found that the respondent had not shown that the accused had committed the offences when he is a young adult."

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","The respondent sought an order varying the child support payable by the respondent by reducing the monthly monthly maintenance payable by reducing it from $250 to $250. The respondent sought to cancel the order by cancelling the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the 1993 order and by varying the access provisions of the 1993 Order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. The petitioner did not proceed by way of notice motion nor did she file appropriate affidavit evidence. HELD: 1)The respondent was not prepared to hear the application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 2)The petitioner was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the 1993 orders. 3)The order was to vary the monthly variation of the order with the effect of providing greater access. 4)The court was not able to hear her application and directed her to file appropriate supporting affidavit evidence in support of her application. 5)The parties agreed that the respondent should have access to all children not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 6)The Court was not ready to hear either application. 7)The father was to pay $250 per month for the children and $325 per month monthly for the maintenance of the following children. 8)The mother was to apply for an order reducing arrearages by canceling the order and cancelling $13.39. 9)The wife was to have access on two weeks per month. 10)The husband was to be given access to one full-week between 6 pm and 6 am on two consecutive days.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, the family doctor and the family physician alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of each of the defendants by the Pipestone District Health Board. The doctors had been members of the medical staff of the Moosomin Union Hospital where all retained privileges. Soon after they formed their clinic, the doctors initiated an on-demand system whereby all the medical practitioners having privileges at the hospital would perform on a rotation basis the on call duties required of them by the hospital. The proposed system was completely voluntary. The hospital administrator for the hospital intervened and the doctors set up new on-calls.

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,FIAT: The applicant applies for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant is granted so that the issue raised in the action may proceed at an early trial. The issues raised in this action are of no concern to him. The applicant is standing by while the cross and third parties proceedings are debated. The plaintiff is stalled in the pursuit of resolution of the issues. The defendant is also ready to proceed. The plaintiffs are also at risk. The court reviewed the minutes of pre-trial management proceedings conducted by Maurice J. of this Court and was satisfied that the action and the other actions pending resolution of this action will be fairly dealt with under the Rules. The concerns of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless. The pursuit of the issue of cross- claim and third-party proceedings will result in a very lengthy period of time. The Court granted the order of the severance seeking so that issues raised may proceed.
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. The petitioner had two children, aged 21 and 18. The respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The mother was attending university and the father was working part-time. The father was paying the child support due under the June 1999 order. HELD: 1) The respondent's income has increased and the mother's income is significantly different from an elementary school student. The Court of Appeal held that in determining whether an adult child in attendance at university qualifies as a child under the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child, the Court of Appeals held that the Table amount of support for the respondent is calculated based on the full extent of his obligation and determined presumptively, irrespective of the mother. The court found that the respondent misapplied s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of s.3(2) of that guideline. The child was not a child of the marriage inasmuch as he was not dependent upon his parents for the necessaries of life. The children were children of the Marriage as contemplated by the Guidelines. 2) The Court found that in the circumstances at hand and the demonstrated ability of the children to obtain reasonably remunerative employment that they are not dependent on their parents during the summer months and have the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance for school, the amount payable by the respondent in accordance with the Table amounts is to be determined having regard for the presumed needs of the child, as reflected in the table amounts, but for their actual means and needs, as demonstrated by the evidence. The presumption of s3(1)(a) is engaged by s3 (2)(a), is rebuttable, having regard the actual needs of his or her parents or obtain the necessary of life without support from parents. The facts at hand are that the petitioner's income in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $18,000 per annum. The husband's income was $1,000 in 2001 and $5,270 in 2002. The wife's income at the time of the order was $800 per month. The parties' income in 2001 was approximately $1 million. The spouse's income from part- time employment was $300 per month and the husband's annual income in 2002 was $600 per month (see Table"
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.",The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff’ s claim for 50 percent of the value of the investment at maturity was dismissed. The defendant’S negligence was not function merely of the defendant‘s occupation. The negligence of both the defendants and the plaintiff was equally applicable in this case involving financial planner and client. The court found that the defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of Mayer’ intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The plaintiff was awarded pre-judgment interest from the date of death of the plaintiff to the date that the judgment was payable and his costs to be taxed. The defendants’ negligence was also found to be equally applicable.
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident. The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent. The plaintiff's wife died shortly after the plaintiff's operation to insert pressure clamps in the presence of an undetected disk hernia. The trial judge, who was not appointed, was not aware of the death of the plaintiff until the hearing of the application. He indicated that he needs to further consider the effect of her death on the action before taking any steps in response. HELD: The evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. The evidence is not unusual nor unexpected in such cases and is helpful to the trier of fact in considering variations from the amounts claimed. The degree of complexity is the key issue in an application to strike on that ground. The Court reviewed the submissions of the parties and the materials presented at the hearing and concluded that the evidence will be of such complexity and of such technical nature that it could not be fully assessed by a properly informed jury."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants for nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golfcourse in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. The plaintiffs had purchased their lot in early 1997 and the plaintiffs, Bosenberg and Strassburg, bought their home in February 2003. The plaintiff had had approximately 1,000 golf balls enter their property every year for nine years. Although fewer balls landed in the plaintiffs’ yards than in 2004, they suffered extensive damage to their homes, windows and vehicles and on other occasions the plaintiffs had narrowly missed hitting workmen and guests in the yard. The defendants were awarded injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years and the plaintiff was awarded injuctive relief against the defendants. The defendant was awarded damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the past 9 years. The court held that the defendants should only be responsible for those damages arising since they became the owners of the course. The Court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute continuing nuisance. The clause does not bind the plaintiffs and even if it did, it does not release the defendants who continue to have the same problem. The parties are liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation. The Town of the plaintiff is entitled to injunjctive relief."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing outside of an apartment building when the police responded to a call of someone banging on the door. The complainant, who smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared to be unsteady on his feet, began to walk towards the accused. The officer approached the accused and told him that he belonged in the apartment. The argument that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty was not supported by the evidence. The arrest was lawful. The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the police were engaged, in the proper execution of the duty, when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him. The Court found that the arrest was, on these facts, lawful."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for unlawful possession of sunscreen in front side windows contrary to the Motor Vehicle Equipment Regulations. The Crown had tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose fine of $200. The officer issued a certificate of offence. voluntary payment option of $105 was provided in the certificate of offense. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment options and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008 return date. The trial was eventually scheduled to take place in 2009. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. He was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The police officer testified that the appellant was operating his Hummer with after-market tinted windows on a public highway. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty of operating the vehicle with aftermarket tinting side windows. The appeal was allowed and the conviction was quashed. The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the sufficiency of the charge. The Appeal was allowed, and the appeal was quashing. The court found that the charge was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the offence nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established. The accused appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed; conviction declared void because it does not charge an offence known to law. The issue of sufficiency was not whether the Crown had a right to know the facts, but whether the information was so clearly wrong that it did so in a way that it was not an essential averment of the crime. The record was so badly drawn up that it could not be reasonably informed of the transaction alleged against him, thus giving him the possibility of a full defence and fair trial. The information recites all the facts and relates them to a definite offence identified by the Code, it is impossible for the accused to be misled. To hold otherwise would be to revert to the extreme technicality of the old procedure."

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.",The accused was charged with aggravated assault and breach of a peace officer. The accused had been on duty for approximately two years and had been involved in an assault on a police officer. He had been charged with breach of peace and breach breach of undertaking. The officer testified that he was called to the scene by the accused to intervene to prevent the breach of the peace. The complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the van and was being assaulted by the defendant. The defendant was at the scene of the assault and the accused was asked to leave the scene. The assault was stopped by the officer. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The court found that the accused had a reasonable right to intervene in the breach and that the officer was entitled to be acquitted. The Court also considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt on count #1. The Crown had invited the accused and the officer to dismiss that charge. The issue of whether the accused acted in the execution of his duty as a police Officer was in some doubt. The defence of self defence was not available as a defence in this case. The offence was aggravated assault on the officer and the breach was foreseeable. The judge dismissed the charge and did so on the basis that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was a police person. The evidence was not compelling to convict the accused on the aggravated assault charge.
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","The applicant, a residential unit owner, brought an application against the Condominium Corporation, its board of directors and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Rule 664 of The Queen's Bench Rules. The applicant sought to have the bylaws interpreted to allow the commercial owners to vote on the board of the corporation. Preliminary objections were made pursuant to Queen's Bylaw 319 by the Condo Corporation and the commercial owner's board seeking relief. HELD: The application was granted. The preliminary decision clarifying what the Court would disregard was provided to the parties prior to the argument of the merits of the application. The Court found that the proper interpretation of the bylaw was for the commercial and residential owners to have their votes counted by the board. The commercial owners were entitled to vote for their own nominees and to exercise their right to see them elected but were not entitled to do so. There was no specific provision in the by-laws that would allow such an interpretation resulting in such a restriction on the commercial's voting rights. The Board was not prepared to do that. The court found that principles of contract interpretation have no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of condominium bylaws. The board was supported by the Court."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The applicants sought to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. The defendants were found to be the defendants in each action. The Court reviewed the Rules, case authorities and material before it and found that the pleadings and submissions of the applicants all indicated that the matters in question were similar in nature and had been tried individually. The court found that there was no evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule. The only thing that would make a consolidation motion a 'proper remedy' was that the defendants had not filed any affidavits or submitted any evidence to support their motion. The applicants had not submitted any of the affidavits and the Court found that although the defendants and the plaintiffs had been in contact for some time, the defendants were not involved in any of these matters. The application for consolidation was dismissed. The applicant had not indicated that he intended to file any other motions. The plaintiffs had not made any submissions and the matter was still before the Court. The applications for consolidation were dismissed."

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 107(c) and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the plaintiff to the action. The plaintiff alleged that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the City of Saskatoon had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. The defendant alleged that a construction, obstruction or erection of any kind adjacent to or in, along or on a travelled portion of the street caused the plaintiff's truck to land in the excavation pit. The applicant argued that adding the city as a third party would allow all damages to be considered and where responsibility should lie for damages arising from the truck leaving the road in one proceeding. The City opposed the application. HELD: The application was granted as requested. 1)The applicant had not raised any causal connection between the road conditions and the plaintiff’s claim. 2)The plaintiff had not made any statement of claim. The court reviewed the pleadings and pleadings of the plaintiff and found no causal connection. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no causal link between the plaintiff, the defendant’ s claim and the defendant. 4)The court reviewed all of the pleadments and pleadments filed by the plaintiff. The only conclusion was that the plaintiff had made no such statement."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT The issue is the interpretation of the consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not involved in the settlement. HELD: 1) The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgement be set aside and trial dates ordered.  2) The respondent seeks an amount of $85,000 to be paid by the husband or alternatively set aside. The wife's application is to be allowed to proceed within 30 days. 3) The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the agreement. 4) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSPs to adjust for tax implications. The court cannot change the language of the judgment."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code and for a sexual purpose touching a young person under 16 contrary to ss. 151(1)(2) of The Crown's Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the alleged assault and that she was concerned about getting sexually transmitted disease. The accused was released from custody on the present charges subject to an electronic monitor and his cousin cut off the monitor which resulted in his arrest. The convictions were upheld and the accused was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. The Court concluded that the accused's evidence when he told the Court that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question was not unreliable. The testimony of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was not reliable. The evidence of the complainant as to when she first saw the accused removed his pants was clear and consistent. The fact that she had not seen the accused remove his pants when she said she did was not sufficient to conclude that she believed that he had removed his underwear. The credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue in this case. The Crown did not err in charging the jury on the issue of credibility. The court found that the evidence of K., who had not consumed alcohol prior to this incident, was not inconsistent with the evidence provided at trial. The trial judge did not require the accused to state that he did not believe the complainant's evidence but rather that he should have. The defence argued that the Court should have taken the issue more seriously. The judge did, however, require the defence to explain to the jury that the complainant had not believed the accused’s evidence and that the Crown had not proven the accused guilty. The issue of whether K.s. should have been more carefully assessed was not an issue. The only issue that could be considered was whether K., as a young girl, was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged offences had occurred. The test of credibility was not appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. The Crown appeals this acquittal. The trial judge correctly stated that the appellant's speed was not an essential element of the offence. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred in law by subjecting individual pieces of evidence to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The accused argued that the Crown misdirected himself to acquit him if he believed the appellant was travelling too fast. The court found that this was not the case. The appellant's trial judge did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant’s speed with either the mens rea or the actus reus. The appeal was dismissed. The evidence of several witnesses who testified that they saw the appellant lose control of his vehicle and that the light conditions were good, the surface of the roadway was dry and there was good visibility. The judge correctly identified the appellant as being travelling faster than the appellant. The offence was dangerous to the public because it was too fast and the appellant lost control of the vehicle. The fact that the accused’ speed was found to be within the menses reus of dangerous drove was not at issue. The decision of the trial court was based on the fact that it was the appellant who had been acquitted. The error of law was not a factor in the Crown’ s.676(1)(a) decision. The only factor that could have been considered was the speed of the accused. The jury was not confused with the speed or the mins reus as an element of dangerous drive. The errors of law were not found to apply to the appellant and the Crown had not erred. The facts did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the speed needed to be proved beyond a certain doubt."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to part II. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1. The Director's application is not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. The Court found no retroactivity issue. 1)The Court found that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 legislation is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The statute is applicable to property seized prior to the time of discovery. The court found that there was no evidence that the property was seized prior or after the time the plaintiff applied. The application is therefore not statute-barred and there was a limitations issue as well. The facts and circumstances of the property were consistent with the purchase and sale of goods. The date of discovery was irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. 2)The Director submits the legal effect vis-a-vis Mr. Butler has not changed with passage of the 2010 Act."

On Appeal.","The Trustee sought an order prohibiting law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate of the bankrupt. The Trustee had been appointed by the bankrupt as custodian of the property of the deceased's bankrupt estate. The bankrupt estate had relied on legal advice from counsel for its creditors. The trustee sought the removal of the law firms. The applicant sought independent legal advice on the matter. The trustee refused to provide it. The court found that the conflict of interest was so blatant that it demanded the removal from the counsel for both the bankrupt estate and the Trustees. The Court ordered the removal because it feared that if the Truste were to follow the advice of the Bank, it would be in a position where it could be influenced by the Bank. The Bank refused to fund the bankruptcy. The plaintiff brought an action against the bankrupt and the trustee sought independent counsel. The defendant brought an application for an order barring the law firm from acting for the trustee. The respondent Bank brought an unsuccessful action against it.

He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop which was tradename owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. He was unable to function for about 3 months after the amputation and needed an extra man to help him with the painting project. He suffered a finger injury and was hospitalized for two weeks. He sought to retain as much of the digit as possible. He argued that warning was unnecessary because the dangers associated with placing finger in front of the nozzle would be well known to the ordinary, prudent person. The plaintiff contended that the defendant was duty bound to provide warning to renters but did not. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was negligent in allowing his finger to come near the spray nozzle. HELD: The plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss of vis-à-vis vis-a-vis the rest of his life were $10,000. The court found that the plaintiffs damages for loss of income, past and future were $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest. The Court found that there was no evidence that the defendants' negligence in failing to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paint spray was a contributory factor. The plaintiffs loss was significant and the defendant's liability for the loss of his income was $5k. The award was limited to $10k for pain, suffering and lost of vis vis- vis-vis life. The claim was not properly assessed because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for a more expeditious trial more expeditiously. The fact that the claim was adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened. The damages for suffering and losses of vis a vis vis vis the restorant were $1,000 and $5K were awarded on $10K. The only damages awarded were for pain in the past and loss to vis-Ã vis the remainder of the life of the plaintiff. The interest was limited because the defendant failed to provide adequate protection to the plaintiff in either relationship. The costs of the claim were not assessed because there was a reasonable risk of loss of life."

The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married for 24 years and had two children.

The child support order was granted whereby the husband was ordered to pay $300 per month for the child support of Ryan. The matrimonial home was to remain locked-ins with the husband until the husband retired in 1996. The order for the matrionial home was also to be transferred.

c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal is from an order of a solicitor general which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Labour Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of s5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power to be made: the existence of an application or complaint before the labour Relations Board, the existence in the Labour relations Board to make final order in respect of the application, and the existence that power in the labour relations board to make a final order. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' and so treated it as a jurisdictional question. Accordingly, the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than whether it was patently unreasonable. Whether it was correct or patently reasonable, the chambers judge came at a right conclusion."
c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed with costs as usual and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the appeal. 1)The legislature said nothing of the possible effects of timely posting but untimely receipt of a notice of appeals given by registered mail. That being so, the legislature said absolutely nothing of how, when, untimeily receipt of notice of an appeal given by means of registered mail, could result in a complete failure to exercise the right to appeal within the prescribed period. 2)The question is whether Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeals properly, if at least, requiring the board to entertain the appeal, requiring it to entertain it in full compliance with all of the terms of the Act. The legislature did not expressly provide for the effect of imperfect compliance or noncompliance with requirement of this nature, but rather, it intended to have regard for its language, the language of the legislation, and the facts with respect to the matter."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed at the Sterlinghazy potash mine on a full-time basis since May 1997. The previous years were not significant because the father's current employment at the mine commenced in May 1997 and he was laid off in October. HELD: 1)The application was granted. The mother's determination of income was made. The child's expenses were not included in the adjusted income for 1998. The costs of the farm were not deducted from the adjusted adjusted income. 2)The father's income was determined by a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claim for gas and repairs was not patently unreasonable. 3)The mother's calculations were not supported by the father. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the farm. 4)The child's income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. 5)The costs of supporting the child were to be paid in the amount of $347 per month. 6)The court ordered the payment of $1,350 to the petitioner and $1.5 to the respondent. The respondent was to pay $1 to the mother. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay the $1 per month plus costs. 8)The amount of leave payable was to be divided among the children. 9)The parties were to pay their annual income tax of $2,350. The court ordered that the respondent pay $350 to each of the parties. The parties were ordered to provide the respondent with the following information: 1.The father had rented equipment from his father and his 1996 return shows and expense of $4,000 for machine rental paid. In 1997 he acquired equipment of his own, including Chevrolet half-ton, GM Yukon and one-third share in two other pieces of farm equipment, grain vac and Morris air seeder. The son's income from 1997 to 1998 was adjusted by projecting the income at a straight wage until October. The acquisition of the equipment and the claiming of capital cost disallowance in these circumstances, in lieu of renting the equipment, is not patinently unreasonable. The Court ordered the respondent to pay his annual income of $7,000."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest. Default judgment against her was taken out January 1997. The defendant, Lila Sheppard, had a cheque number 70919 certified at the plaintiff bank. The defendants had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The certified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The plaintiffs had already received payment for their services. The claim was dismissed.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order requiring him to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff was mentally competent to instruct his solicitor. The applicants recognized that if the requested order was granted, this action could nevertheless continue with the appointment of a litigation guardian. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application was simply another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetencies. The court found that a certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial, for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardians being appointed. This is not a case where the Court feels obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. The Act exists in order that the Court might control its own process. The argument seemed premised on the fact that if a party to civil litigation was mentally incompetent without having been certified as such, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs. The fact that the plaintiff's family physician had examined him and had issued a certificate that the deceased was incapable of communicating with counsel for the purposes of the estate, which would result result in litigation guardian being appointed, does not suggest that the court should take this action lightly. The applicant's application was also dismissed."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to cause death to his wife, his children and his step-sister. The wife had recently passed away and the accused had been living on a farm with her for 64 years. The accused had lived on a property owned by her step-mother for 64. The daughter had recently died and the family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to the estate. The father had recently moved to Prince Albert and the daughter had been in the business. The mother had arranged to go bowling with her friend. The son had already arranged to take some family pictures off the walls. The Accused had called his stepmother to tell her that he would blow them up. The friend had called the accused to say that he was coming to the farm to get his belongings and that he intended to blow them away. The conversation was recorded and the court was able to hear the conversation and the defendant's response to the accused's threats. The Court found that the accused was truthful and that the statements made by the accused were not made in a vacuum. The court found that there was no evidence that the Accused knew the names of the three people who had died in the telephone conversation and that there had been a conspiracy between the accused and the other three people. The Crown was required to place sufficient evidence before the Court as to each of the elements of the offence which, when taken in the context of all the evidence presented, satisfies the Court beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence is made out. The defence argued that the defence had failed to establish that the evidence was so unreliable that it was not relevant to the Court's decision. The evidence was not supported by the evidence. The only evidence that could be given to the defence was that the father had called to say he would shoot the three children and that his stepson had told him that he had to go to town and report the conversation to his father. The statement of fact was not given to defence counsel. The defendant was acquitted. The trial judge found that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded insofar as they relate to the Accuse's credibility."

The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence. Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence. The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.  2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000.

The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of the respondent was available, counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants. The proffered fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the 'cause of the fire'.

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff was injured when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the defendant's store. The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000. The defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff. The plaintiffs second counsel, who was experienced, was on the stand for two and three quarters hours. He was paid $1,000 for consultation and $650 for medical report that was not entered into evidence. The court ordered that the plaintiff be examined by an anaestheologist who specializes in chronic pain management. HELD: 1) A great deal of expert medical evidence was of marginal value. The costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 2) The amount of expert witness expenses must be reasonable; the witness testimony contribution to the case and relevant to the issues. 3) The plaintiff's second counsel fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee. 4) The court found that the expert medical testimony introduced by the defendant was of no value. It was reasonable to consider whether the plaintiff's expert medical report was of value. 5) The costs are in the discretion of the Court. Taxable court costs should be based upon either hardship, the degree or the success of the party. The amounts expended by a party for investigation or in the gathering evidence may actually exceeded the value the claim may be made. The level at which a second counsel fees should be taxed or allowed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. The accused indicated that the motor vehicle accident occurred when it was his belief that he had a valid provisional driver's license. Pursuant to the letter from S.G.I., he had participated in the Driving Without Impairment program and had been advised of his eligibility for a provisional license. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged. The Court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence of the accused was credible. The Crown had not proven beyond a doubt that he was not guilty of driving while suspended. The court was of the view that the driving while disqualification matter should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities. The only thing that would make a full conviction a full offence is if the accused could confirm that he has knowingly operated the vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification. The driving while barred matter should not be regarded a full-mens reae offence, but rather one of a strict liability offence requiring the offender to establish proper due diligence."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The accused, who was charged with unlawfully causing the death of Justice Dean Sproat, brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. He also sought an order pursuant to ss. 119(1)(q) of s.C. 2002 directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under s.7 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and particulars of the convictions. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The accused had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. The evidence from pre-trial publicity and the fact that the accused had been advised that the organization had issued bumper stickers and other bumper stickers would affect his ability to have a fair and impartial trial. The accused had met the burden of proof. 2)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the Court was not prejudiced by the media reports. The Court reviewed all of the evidence from the pre- and post-trial media reports and found no evidence of general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council. The resolution is a mandatory injunction and the election is nullity. The applicants, who are residents of Wilcox, seek an interim injunction preventing the Board of education from acting on a resolution made to close the school. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law do not suggest a strong prima facie case. The court found that the Act does not state non-compliance with formalities will result in nullity and that there was no evidence or suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. The Court found that there is no evidence that a different School Council would have existed if the additional two days had been given. The applicant's position that the election took place two days short of the deadline was not supported by the facts. The respondent failed to comply with the common law duty of fairness in passing its resolution for school closure. The Act does state non compliance with formal requirements will result (i.e. non-nullification of an act done otherwise than in the prescribed manner). There was no prejudice caused by non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election. There was also no suggestion a new school council was elected if it was not given extra two-day leave. The respondents' submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community was two days late was not a strong enough prima-facie case to warrant an injunction."

A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiff engages in the business of oil and gas exploration and development in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada. In the course of its business, the plaintiff engages contractors to drill oil and natural gas wells. The plaintiffs engage in the exploration and gas well production business. The defendant engages in this business and engages in cementing services contractors, including the third party contractors. The defendants are engaged in the oil andgas exploration and production business and the plaintiff undertakes these contracts. The third parties engage in this activity and the plaintiffs are also engaged in cement making. The parties engage cementing service contractors to cement casing in the well bores. The court is obligated to provide the plaintiff with responses to undertakes made by the third parties. The respondents are not obligated to supply the respondent with complete answers to the questions. The respondent is not obligated by law to provide complete answers. The Court will support any legislative framework which clarifies these relationships for Saskatchewan PST. The Respondents are required to provide full and complete responses to the undertakings. The applicant seeks judgment against the defendant for the amount paid. The three parties are obligated to comply with the governing legislation. The examination for discovery is to be held prior to the completion of examinations for all parties. If the respondent changes its position, it may supplement its initial response. The application for an order requiring the respondent to provide responses to certain undertakings is not an attempt to quash the claim for privilege. The evidence is not conclusive that the respondent's position is in conflict with the plaintiff's. The documents in the possession, custody or control of the respondent are not to be disclosed. The petitioner is not obliged to provide any responses to any undertakings made by third parties other than those made by him. The Plaintiff is not required to disclose the names of the undertakes. The Certificate of Disclosure is not available. The Registrar of the Court is not responsible for the costs of discovery."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The only remaining issue was the retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The respondent had made overtures to the respondent for increased child maintenance, but had refused to provide any additional amount. The petitioner now applied for a retroactive award with regard to the section 7 expenses. The parties separated in August 2001 and the respondent continued to provide child maintenance to the petitioner. Prior, there had been no written agreements or court orders dealing with the issue. The husband's dramatic increase in salary was in and of itself sufficient notice his child maintenance obligation had to be increased. The wife had made an effort to obtain additional information about the husband's income and the husband had refused. The child was now living with his mother. The mother's request for retroactive awards was denied. The court found that the husband was paying less than legally required given his income and that the respondent had not shown sufficient notice of the need for increased support. The father's dramatic increases in salary were in and out of proportion'sufficient notice' his child support obligation had been increased."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Seizure of Criminal Property Act sought leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent. The Director argued that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, remove the profit from crime and the need for compensate victims. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Chambers judge did not have the power to make a sweeping decision on the merits of this case. 2)The Director was not at all sure that the judge overlooked or failed the interests and, in particular, the need of deterring crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the relevant case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but had amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s23 of the Act and an order under ss.37 of the act granting them custody. The Agency requested the additional information. HELD: The agency applied for and was granted custody of the children. The agency requested personal service of this decision be provided to each of the individuals within 15 days of receipt of it. The children were identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. The information was obtained from the foster parents and the father. The father had consented to a long-term order and had consents to the order. The evidence before the agency was that each child was in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b) of The Act. The court was satisfied that the revised plan was appropriate in these circumstances. The Father, having agreed to a longer term order, had agreed to have a continuing relationship with the children but indicated that he was unable to care for them. The new plan was also appropriate in the circumstances."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.",HELD: The Court held that the Court could not proceed with the application. The Court ordered that the application be dismissed. The court found that the petitioner had not shown that she was in a position of strength to take on the additional burden of caring for the child. The child was not capable of self-sufficiency and was not likely to succeed in the child's primary care. The petitioner had demonstrated that she could not rely on the support of her parents. The respondent had not demonstrated that he could provide the child with the necessary support and the child was capable of responding to the needs of both parents.
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT MILLS: The plaintiffs brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) of the former Queen's Court Rules to have the claim struck in its entirety. The plaintiffs argued that the insurer was in a special relationship with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The insurer refused to settle the claim and instead made a false plant sample, which drifted across the plaintiffs' land and caused crop damage and subsequent financial loss. The second defendant, Junop, deliberately submitted a false seed sample, not of the plaintiffs’ crop, which he knew in advance would not show Touchdown and Banvel and would in turn notify their insurer, SMI. The third defendant, Frith, who as an agrologist knowledgeable about farm chemicals so that he knew better, deliberately used false lab results along with specious allegations of flooding to wrongfully zero out the claim. HELD: The claim was struck in entirety. 1)The plaintiff was obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants under the policy. 2)The court found that the defendant was obliged not to settle but to submit to the plaintiff’s demand for compensation. 3)The Court found that a contract of insurance between an insurer and its insured is one of utmost good faith. Although the insurer is not fiduciary, it holds a position of power over an insured; conversely, the attempted addition of its agents and employees in the circumstances of this nuisance or negligence claim against the first defendant cannot stand. The Court found the defendant’ s conduct was in breach of the contract and was not an absolute obligation giving rise to an automatic claim for consequential damages in the event of any failure to make timely payment in accordance with the policy; and 3)It found that there was no breach of a contract between the insurer and the plaintiffs. The defendant‘s conduct was not in breach. The plaintiff was entitled to the same relief as the plaintiff in this action. 4)The defendant”s conduct in this case was not accepted by the court."

The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT The applicant/petitioner applied for variation of an interim consent order issued in August 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's income of approximately $0. The respondent agreed to inextricably intertwine the payor's spousals and child support obligations to the total amount of child support and to the amount of spousa and child care expenses. The applicant was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces and had been for 11 years. He was a military member when the order was made and now continues to be. The petitioner had no income and suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continued to assert she was disabled and unable to engage in employment. The appellant applied to terminate the obligations for payment. Application dismissed; the applicant was prepared to either apply for or agree to split his CPP credits or support her application to do so. The court found that voluntary early retirement or for that matter, the choice of a payor to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs for lesser pay did not constitute a material change in circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payer's obligation to pay child or spousousal child support. The Court found that a material adjustment in circumstances could be a material reason for a variation request. The parties agreed to combine the payors' spousas and child and child child support payments to the respondent and to provide support to the applicant so long as she remained child within the provisions of Divorce Act. The application was dismissed. The Applicant was prepared and able to reapply."

The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties which was effective in October 1999 and expires in September 2002. The grievor was the first to experience reduction of work hours in the front desk department where she placed fourth on the departmental seniority list behind the other three employees. She also alleged that the reduction of her work hours based on departmental and hotel seniority constituted a violation of Article 9 of the collective agreement. HELD: The appeal was granted. The court found that the wording of Article 10 of the Collective Agreement is wide enough to encompass the situation. The arbitrator's conclusion that the phrase 'hours within department' is wide is patently unreasonable. The fact that the arbitrator chose to use the phrase is pathetically unreasonable. It is not patently reasonable. The appeal court found the arbitrators interpretation of the wording was not only reasonable but also reasonable."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused.

He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order.

Despite paying child support, the respondent has enjoyed virtually no access. Despite being required to bring an application and obtained the supervised access order in issue, he was only successful in obtaining supervised access on two occasions. The father applied for an additional order varying the terms. HELD: The application is allowed and the respondent is denied. 1)The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the father has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor is the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. Almost without exception, the petitioner refused to make the child available for the supervised visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. The respondent continued to be in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The court was of the view that the respondent will not again disobey court orders so that fine is not called for in the circumstances. 2)The respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with the terms and the order. Almost every access was refused. She continued to make it impossible for the petitioner to access the child. The August 15, 2002 order of Koch J. was vacated. The September 15, 2003 order of the Court of Appeal was vacated as well. The July 2002 order was vacated in the absence of a fine.

The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison. The mother lived with the paternal grandmother in Halifax and had thirteen children. The father lived with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The Crown had previously applied for remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, presenting materials indicating that a doctor would be qualified and able to provide the Court with the necessary assessment within the required time. The Court found that the accused had a history of violence and that he should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now consider whether the subject of the application might be a long term offender, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s.753(1) for dangerous offender finding have been met. The court found that there was a substantial possibility that the subject might be found a longterm offender despite the statutory requirements in s753.1. The accused had been involved in three separate relationships and had been in one of them for a period of time prior to his release from custody. The offences occurred in the context of a domestic dispute between the accused and the accused. The relationship between the parties was violent and the offence of assault was violent. The offence of sexual assault was the predicate offence. The offender had been convicted of aggravated assault and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of between 3 and 5 years. The sentencing judge found that he had not met the criteria set out in Johnson and that the Crown had failed to properly consider the evidence concerning attempts which had been made to control the offender's behaviour in the community and the failure of the expert who testified to consider this when he gave his opinion. The judge found the accused to be a dangerous and long- term offender and sentenced him to indeterminate detention."

The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.

The petitioner had been living with her father for four years and had recently moved from Nova Scotia to Alberta. The father had recently been reassigned to the city of Calgary. The mother had recently become more stable and the father had been granted independent access.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.",The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogations.

She had been discharged from the hospital two days later. She required further surgery and underwent partial bowel resection. She also underwent brain surgery. She suffered brain damage and was living in long-term care facility in Saskatoon. The plaintiffs sought to have the respondent's physician refer to as Dr. Vrbancic to his medical report. The respondent was granted an order requiring him to provide further particulars and undertaking responses. The court found that the respondent had not shown sufficient restraint in providing the plaintiff with particulars and undertakings. The Court dismissed the application. The respondents were entitled to responses to questions and/or undertaking questions as provided by the respondent. The Queen's Bench Rules do not permit the use of information derived from investigations or reviews conducted by hospital boards or the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The privilege is absolute and cannot be waived. The only remedy available is to have an order struck pursuant to Queen's Rule 173(a) of the Queen's Court Rules. The applicant was to provide particulars of the respondent on particulars and undertake responses given. The application was adjourned sine die. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the plaintiff.

Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.

The plaintiffs alleged that these alleged damages were caused by the defendants' negligence and that the plaintiffs were in relationship with one of the parties who caused the injury. The amendments to the amended claim were permitted by Queen's Bench Rule 66 and that leave of the court under s.20 of the Act was not required. The application was dismissed. The proposed amendments do not apply to the original and amended claims.

The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. The plaintiffs and their litigation guardian had been the subject of negative comments on social networking sites. The defendant had previously submitted that the young persons were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiff had also submitted that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm done to them. HELD: The defendant's application for an injunction sealing the affidavit of the plaintiffs was granted. The affidavits were sealed. The court held that any further publication would not cause further harm to the plaintiffs or their families. The sealing order was at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavit of JR and JR was sealed. It was also agreed that portions of the affidavit would not be sealed."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach legal representation. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of operating a vehicle while intoxicated contrary to ss. 254(3) of The Criminal Code and his s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence. The Court found that the accused's Charter rights had not been infringed. The admission of the Certificate ofalyses would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The officer acted in good faith. The court found that there was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, fromfleeting and technical to profoundly invasive. The more serious the effect of the breach on the accused’s Charter rights, the greater the risk that the admission of evidence obtained as result of the breaches would bring the Administration of justiceinto disreprepute, which is not the circumstance in the present case. The defence argued that the delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel. The issue of impaired driving and the potentially serious consequences thereof, including endangering the lives of others, leads to the violation of the accuseds s.10(b Charter right. The police officer should have informed the accused why he was placed in the police vehicle and ought to have made the demand as soon as he formed the reasonable suspicion that the driver had alcohol in his body. The offence of impaired driver is serious one. The arrest was made and the accused was detained for 11 minutes. The delay was largely due to the unavailability of an ASD. The officers knowing the accused had not reached either of their office numbers, took no steps to provide the accused with their after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. The failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did raises the issue of reasonable diligence. The fact that the officer appeared to have acted in a good faith manner would not have brought the administration into disarray. The certificate ofalyses was admitted in evidence."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was required to address s. 90 of the Criminal Code with respect to the definition of a weapon. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as a weapons. 2)The Crown had no reasonable doubt the accused used the sword for the purposes enumerated in s. 2 of the Code. The only evidence before the trial judge that the defendant probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. The accused testified that he had just purchased the sword and was taking it home to display in his room or on his television. The Crown argued that the trial Judge erred in not recognizing that the blade was a decorative one and that it was likely part of a 'junk' or 'fancy' item. The trial judge concluded that she had a reasonable suspicion that the weapon was designed for use by a person who had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, and that the locking device renders the knife safer when it is used for a decorative purpose. The switchblade was also found to be a 'jackknife' and the accused's evidence that he was aware that it had been readily available in novelty stores and that he put it on display in the store. 3)The accused's testimony was not supported by the Crown's evidence. The judge was not required to answer s. 8 of the C. Code. 4)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the evidence was not relevant to the trial decision on the prima facie basis. The Court reviewed all the evidence available to the Crown and concluded that the judge had not found that either the accused or the Crown intended to make use of the sword within the meaning of s.2 of the code. The evidence was properly the subject of expert evidence put in under the guise of opinion evidence, notwithstanding that a knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches and ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively. The defence maintains the position that the case was relevant to trial judge's determination with respect"
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The applicant sought leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in chambers denying leave. The applicant argued the order was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the amount of legal fees paid to the applicant was reasonable and equitable. The respondent sought to have the order struck as a discretionary one. The Administrative Judge granted leave to the respondent to appeal. The application was granted. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the applicant had not complied with the VA and the applicant did not have any idea there were some 57,000 time entries which were misdescribed or would not form part of the claim. The Applicant sought to obtain additional information in a format compatible with the original information. The administrative judge did not err by requiring the applicant to pay the alleged accounts of ESI without sufficient information and without due process. The order was therefore a discretionary ordering designed to help the verification of the applicant's claims. The Court reviewed the applicant’s evidence and concluded that the application was not made in error. The appeal was denied. The appellant failed to establish there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the state of law, or the administration of justice generally, to warrant a determination by the Court of Appeal. The leave application was denied and the prospective respondent was ordered to have its costs in the usual manner."
d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff put forward a cheque to the defendants for $5,000. The defendant claimed the $1,000 was a gift and the return of the $5k was a repayment of the advance. The counterclaim as to the $2,400 was not proven. The plaintiff had agreed to the amounts being paid back. The defendants testified that there was no request to pay the loan back until about a year later. The $5K was agreed to by the plaintiff and there if no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by the defendant Lilia. The court found that there were no loan of $1k,000 to the plaintiff as there was not any loan documentation prepared and signed by the Defendant Lilia and there was also no evidence that the $3,000 gift was not received shortly after the defendant's dismissal. The evidence as whole did not support the counterclaim. The Court found that the defendant had agreed that the payments were not consented to and agreed to and there were none near the time Lilia testified. The Defendant Lilias also claims the $4,000 cheque was never received and there is no evidence as to when Lilia received it. The only evidence that Lilia ever spoke to anyone about the $500 cheque is that Lilias never received it from the Defendant. The affidavit filed by Lilia states that the Defendant gave $1 million to the Plaintiff and $5 million to Christos. The Plaintiff claims the defendant gave $2 million to her and then paid it back. She also claims that the plaintiff gave $960 to Christo and that the defendants paid the sum of $960 back. As the plaintiff is a corporation, the defendant is entitled to damages as well. The issue of the defendant’s claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The defendant Lilias’ claim is not proven as there’d be any loan of the type Lilia claims. The balance of probabilities are not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, in light of the Court’ s finding that she has worked 604 hours, the issue of damages as to this aspect of the Defendant’’ claims is adjournd to be decided by the Court and the parties will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant"
d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine, marijuana, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of a weapon. The accused had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court meeting. The youth had been on probation for a conviction of possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine and had been in possession of one package of cocaine for a period of 2 years. The Crown had made a mandatory prohibition order under s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had the permission of the Court. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38 of the YCJA. The court also found that the accused had not been involved in a violent or violent crime for the past year. The most aggravating factor was the fact that the youth was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted of possessing for the use of trafficking cocaine. The fact that he had been living in the area for the last year and had not attended a youth meeting was an aggravating factors. The Youth Court sentenced the accused to 6 months deferred custody and supervision. The sentence imposed was to be based on 76 grams of cocaine."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence and that of the two young children presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: The court ordered that the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. The court found that by adopting this position, the father has not truly considered the best interests of the children. He does not presently (nor in the near future) present a viable parenting alternative. The children have been in the mother's care for the past nine months. There has been a material change of circumstances affecting the children, which is largely self-evident. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives. The Court found that this is an exceptional case. The mother's move with the children would be beneficial. The child's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused was stopped for checking for driver's licence, registration and sobriety. The video of the stop was not available and the accused declined the opportunity to call a lawyer. HELD: The accused is not guilty of count 2 over.08. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The observation at the detachment was not properly conducted. The police officer observed the accused walk down a goat trail and then turned off to a road that resembled a 'goat trail'. The video showed the accused walking down a trail and not turning around. The officer observed him for approximately 2½ minutes. During that time he observed the defendant walk down the goat trail. The defendant declined the chance to call lawyer on two occasions. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy and rely on readings on the Certificate of Qualified Technician. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By (2005) also takes the position that the stop of the accused was not conducted properly. The court found that the observation period was not held properly. It is important that the police officer observe the accused for continuous 15 minutes prior to each breath test to allow any alcohol which may be present in the mouth to dissipate. The observed period was conducted at close proximity to the accused's presence. The observations were not conducted in every instance. The only evidence that the accused admitted to having consumed an alcoholic beverage five minutes prior was that he had gone to another room for brief time leaving the accused unattended. The Police officer was not in position to take the breath sample forthwith and could not know when the ASD would become available. The complainant had to wait fifteen minutes before could take a sample into the ASD. The RCMP officer was checking for licence, registered and sobrieety. Hearsay: The Court found that if it is established that the observations were properly conducted, then that constitutes evidence that there is a reasonable suspicion that the breathalyzer test was not administered. The appellant declined the ability to call counsel on two separate occasions after he was advised of his rights to counsel. The failure to call the lawyer on the third occasion was indicative of no mouth alcohol. The trial judge found that there was no presumption of reliability in s. 258(1)(c) of the Code. The offence was not found to be a breach of his Charter rights. The fact that the officer observed a person walk down goat trail is not sufficient to support a conviction. The incident was not random and the observation was not a"

The Crown and defence both made submissions to the trial court that the Crown had advanced the same recommendations in favour of the accused. The trial judge sentenced the accused to four years imprisonment for armed robbery, 1 year for the weapons offence and 1 year to be served consecutively. The appellant appealed the sentences.

The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser- Brace and required Fraser-Bace to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. The appellant issued a builder's risk policy to Fraser Brace but the policy was never required to carry builder's insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. He ordered the policy to be void and the policy never did. Several issues had been raised on appeal. The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed.

The trial court found that there was no breach of the contract. The appellant's claim was not that the appellant negligently misrepresented the amount of time he would be working on the project but that the respondent's failure by not reducing the notice period for five months to account for the appellant’s failure to adequately mitigate her losses. 3) The appellant”s claim was that the employer had induced the appellant to leave her company and join KPMG and that the termination of her employment would result in five months’ notice.

Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter transportation. The defendants were involved in a construction project which involved the loss of nine people and the loss or destruction of property. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and negligent helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendant corporate counsel was retained to deal with potential litigation issues arising out of the accident. The plaintiff's request for a safety report was refused. The court found that the plaintiff's demand for safety report and the defendant's refusal to provide it was inherently dangerous. The Court granted leave to reapply for direction. The questions on the availability of alternative forms of transportation, the cost of such alternatives, the reliability or safety of the alternatives, and the availability and use of the e-mail system were logically relevant to the plaintiff’s decision to continue using the airline as a shuttle. The only relevance to the plaintiffs’ claim was that the decision was made by the defendant corporate lawyer, who had hired an independent contractor. The issue was whether the defendant corporation was in a position to determine when such survival gear was placed on board the helicopters, and if so, if so. The question was whether insurance was obtained, and who arranged and paid for the same. The answer was that it was not. The case law clearly states that the only relevance is whether the plaintiff was in the position to decide when such gear was put on board a helicopter. The same is true for the company’ s position in the workplace. The company”s position was that if the defendant was in position to find out when such equipment was placed, the question should be answered. The fact that the company had hired a third party to provide the equipment was irrelevant. The corporate lawyer” s position was not supported by the pleadings. The issues raised by the plaintiffs were not questions of insurance or liability. The applicant” was not entitled to know when the equipment had been placed on the helicopter."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order to declare that the Land Use By-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had established a private pool hall which was part of a residential area. The premises was in an area of the municipality and subject to the respondent's Land Use by-laws. The owner of the premises had constructed a kitchen and bar on the premises. The bar was a private club and the owner had a special premises liquor license. The establishment was a club and was subject to zoning restrictions. The club's current use is a lounge and the bar is open to members of the public and the applicant's present premises is a billiard bar. The proposed change in the liquor license would only have the effect of moving the applicant from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The current use of the property is a non-conforming use. The development agreement would require a development permit. The application for a change in liquor license was granted pursuant to the Landuse By-laws of the Municipality of East Hants. The Municipality appealed the decision of the Development Officer, who held that the municipality could not have contemplated an interference with the use of its land by the applicant unless the language used clearly required some other construction to be given to the enactment. The municipality appealed the development officer's decision. Appeal allowed. The court found that the Municipalities' position was that the applicant had not made a change to the use by-law which would result in a change of use. Appeal denied. The city's position was not supported by the development agreement. The landowner's position is that the development agreements between the municipality, the municipality or the development authority do not have to be signed by the Development officer. The community's interest in the landowner is paramount. The fact that the land is in the municipality's possession does not mean that the property has changed. The property is in a special use area and the development of the land does not have a special purpose. The purpose of the establishment is to provide a public place for the people of the community. The building is to be used as a meeting place. The meeting place is to serve food and beverages. The restaurant is to have a bar and lounge. The pub is to offer a lounge."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused was charged with two counts of assault and one count of mischief. The accused had been released on conditions of release after pleading guilty to three intervening offences of breaching his undertaking. The Crown argued that the delay was caused by factors outside the control of the accused, such as the delay in reaching a plea and the delay caused by the defendant's failure to appear in court. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused had not suffered actual prejudice. The conditions of his release were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. 2)The Court found no actual prejudice and that the defendant had not been subjected to undue hardship. 3)The delay was not attributable to the Crown or caused by factor outside the Control of the defendant. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to both parties. 4)The court found no prejudice. 5)The defendant had suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. 6)The trial date was set for October 7, 2004. 7)The respondent had not caused prejudice."
e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff was injured when his van was hit by a vehicle driven by a second individual. The plaintiff had joined the action his own insurer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the second individual and that the driver had no knowledge of its owner. The court also found that there were inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence concerning the identity of the driver and the identity the driver of the vehicle. The inconsistencies in his evidence were significant. The defendant had sold the van for $500 and that he had traded it for drugs. The trial judge found that this was not the case. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the identity and identity of this vehicle, the identity, the driver, the vehicle and whether the driver has the owner's consent to operate it. The Defendant had not reached the parking lot until after the van had sped away. The Plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The defendants were absent from the trial. The evidence was inconsistent. The only thing that was consistent was that the defendant had not shown any remorse for the actions of the accused. The judge found the defendant guilty of all charges."
e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to the Bank. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and rental of land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it commenced the business of leasing. The business of lease was started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite in December 2001. The bank registered a financing statement in the personal property registry on April 6, 2004. The Trustee filed an Agreed Statement of Facts (without exhibits) with attached exhibits. HELD: The Court found that the Bank was'regularly engaged in the business' within the meaning of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3. The lease was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within that meaning of PPSAs and it required registration.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","The appellant was participating in a demolition derby when he suffered burns to various parts of his body. He was flagman for the Bjorkdale Lions Club. The fire department responded to the call for assistance and the appellant was charged with negligence. The plaintiff brought an appeal on the basis the trial judge had not adduced sufficient evidence of causation between the appellant's injury and the acts of negligence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, which addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff adduce sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. 2)Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury could not have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the injury. The damage would have occurred within seconds of the competition halted and the fire department's response to the condition was unsuccessful. 3)Had it been permitted, the trial jury could have concluded the appellant caused or caused the extent to the appellant’s injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would not have occurred in the manner it did on the appellant. The appellant suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. 4)Had there been a trial, the damages would have been assessed on a balance of probabilities and the damage could have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. The court would have found that the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the conditions he had observed would have caused or been materially contributed by the respondent. The jury could only have concluded on a percentage of probabilities that either the respondent caused or was indirectly contributed to extent of his injury."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original Custody Judgment, seeking joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The mother had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of the original judgment. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the Original Custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for joint custody, was possible. The Court found that the mother had not rebutted the father's position that she wished to move to Whitehorse because it would allow her to have more contact with the child and that the child would be better able to live with the father. The father was granted sole custody of his child. The child was currently enrolled in kindergarten and daycare close to her father's apartment in Saskatoon. However, her kindergarten teacher confirmed that the school was not in Saskat. The Father filed a further application seeking custody of a child. HOLD: The Court held that there was a material difference in the situation at the point of the initial Custody judgement when it thought that cooperation of both parties, such as the cooperation between the parties and the child's ability to meet the needs of the mother, was not a material issue. The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation to White Horse. The only issue was whether change in custody was in the best interests of the children. The respondent was granted interim custody of their child and the mother was granted joint custody. The Custody Division ordered that the father be granted sole and shared custody of custody of all children."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The applicant, who is a First Nations faculty member, filed a grievance alleging that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The grievance alleged that the university had interfered by withdrawing an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a conference held in April. The respondent appealed. He argued the Board of Governors exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective agreement. The Board of Directors then asked the First Nation University president to reconsider the matter. The university appealed. Appeal dismissed; the Board's decision to entertain the grievance did not fall within the purview of the Agreement. The employer had not interfered with the applicant's academic freedom and the Board had not followed the directions of the Board. The decision was therefore within the Board’s jurisdiction."

The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT. The parties had two children born of a relationship between the respondent and the petitioner. The respondent was employed as a hotel supervisor and worked two weeks a week for two weeks followed by a week off. The petitioner was employed by drilling company and worked every day for two and one week off from Saturday to Tuesday. The agreement between the parties entered into following their separation did not address the fact that the petitioner would be laid off for two months in the spring. Unfortunately, more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born to his relationship with the respondent. The order in issue here is an interim one.  2) There is no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.  3) The court finds no evidence that there has been a material change or that altering the existing regular access will be in the best interests of the children. The court does not find that there is a material need to change the petitioner’s regular access. The only change that would be in best interests is that the respondent would be able to take the children for two non-consecutive periods in the winter.

e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the grounds that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There certainly was no procedural unfairness to the appellant as there was no miscarriage of the justice as a result of the tactics of Mr. Dubelt and Klassens. The appellant did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide, that came as a consequence of the decisions he freely made. The trial judge treated the appellant fairly and attempted to accommodate the unrepresented litigants' unfamiliarity with the process so as to permit them to present their case. The objective fairness of the trial has not been diminished because of the strategy of Mr Dubelt. 2) The reasoning in Romanowicz and Wolkins conclusively decides that the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard is not equal to that of a competent attorney. The Court cannot rely upon the fact the standard was not equal."

The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with two counts of criminal mischief and one count of assault. The accused had come before the Court for preliminary inquiry on the charges.

Defence Counsel declined. HELD: The accused was granted an adjournment to call Sergeant. The Court was satisfied that there was a reasonable expectation that he could be called as a material witness for the defence in this preliminary inquiry. The Defence was not guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The defence was not negligent in procinding the attendance.

e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer observed an individual operating a motor vehicle and properly obtained his name and date of birth. The accused was arrested and read his rights to counsel. The Court found that the officer had not requested identification pursuant to provincial legislation nor did he have reason to suspect that the accused had committed an offence. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible. The Crown relied on s. 260(6) of The Traffic Safety Act to require the operator of a motor car to provide his name, address and date on which he was disqualified from driving. The certificate was not in issue. The only other evidence of disqualification comes from the statement made by the accused to the officer. The statement made to the police officer was the same person who stood before the court. Although there was no identification of the accused in court, the officer was clearly empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of THE Traffic Safety act to require that the operator be properly attested to his driver's licence and the voluntariness of these statements were not in question. The court found that although there was a no identification in court the officer clearly empowered s.209.1 of The Highway Traffic Safety Authority to require notice has been given in accordance with s.30(7) ofthe Act. Without compliance with s 260(7), the certificate is not adduced. The offence was committed as opposed to a violation of the Traffic Safety. The identity of the person who was arrested was established. The police officer clearly authorized s.19 of The Motor Vehicle Act to ask the operator to provide the driver's name and his date of Birth and voluntarily of these statement were not established. Without the voluntaristiness of the statement, the certificate was inadmissible."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The Court held that the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not warranted. The Court found that the accused had not shown any evidence of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. The accused sought to exclude all of the images of the accused located on his computer. The court found that there was no question but that those images constituted child pornography. The evidence of the complainant did not appear to be part of the trial evidence. The only evidence presented was that of the respondent, who had been on his way to the trial. The respondent had not asked the respondent for the information which he had acquired in this regard. The complainant did testify that she had seen the accused take pictures of her in the shower. The appellant had not provided this evidence to the court. The trial judge found that this evidence was not part of his analysis of the internet search history. The issue of exclusion of the information pursuant to the Charter right was not determined at that time."
