3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T. Equipment applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'Trustee') pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. At the December meeting of creditors, 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. At January 13, 2003 the Trustee made an application to the Registrar for Court approval of the applicant's Proposal. Notice of Objection to this application was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor who was a former 28-year employee of the Company. The Trustee was bound by the terms of collective bargaining agreement applicable to certain of its production employees including Mr. Tilk. At that December meeting approximately 89 percent of creditors voted for the Proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed it. HELD: The Proposal was accepted. Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded, in the circumstances reviewed and for the reasons outlined in this judgment, that the proposal presented by W.R.'T. does meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The 15 employees in the same position voted in favor of the proposal, 2 opposed it, 2 abstained from filing proofs, 1 opposed the proposal and 1 opposing the amendment. The Court was much in sympathy with the concerns which the applicant has raised by his objection and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing of this application. Absent the application of the provisions of the BIA to an employer it is clear that an employer's indebtedness to an employee pension plan does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. Accordingly the proposed Proposal is accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 9.1. The court will refuse to refuse to approve the proposal whenever it is established that the debtor has committed any one of the offences mentioned in sections 198 to 200."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he had consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The evidentiary burden was stated to be beyond reasonable doubt. While the trial judge may have been referring to the burden of proof, he went further and stated that he did not raise a credible doubt. With respect that was a fundamental error of law and the Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy. 2)The appellant's reading at the time of the driving, 1650 hours, was over point zero eight."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The wood is harvested from Provincial Crown lands. The logs are then processed for inclusion in the log home package. The Crown alleges that the defendant took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the Crown requires such a licence. HELD: 1) Given the evidence presented that the steps taken by the defendant, which included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log market, the Crown's interpretation would create an absurdity. 2) The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence issued by the Ministry of Environment pursuant to the FMPA. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence that the step for manufacturing has already taken place. The steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. 3) The Crown's position creates an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. 4) The court was able to find the defendant guilty of violating the terms of the Act."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","This was an appeal pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. In 1994 and earlier there had been public allegations that physical, sexual and other abuse had occurred in certain provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. HELD: The appeal is taken from a decision of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998, whereby the appellant was denied access to information requested. The appellant was aware of the allegations and was aware that the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that Inquiry had been conducted. The investigation material accumulated by both the IIU and the VIU referred to the former residents of the institutions who complained of physical and/or sexual abuse as either 'victims' or'survivors' and the type and frequency of the abuse complained of were identical in many cases and similar, but not identical, in other cases. The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of justice became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the appellant."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in losses to the tenant's restaurant. The tenant claims damages for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. The evidence does show that a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of business from customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. Although the evidence shows that the restaurant was closed for several days even though daily overhead costs of $1,600 continued, no evidence was offered as to the landlord's negligence."

HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant was charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. He also displayed actions that were harmful to the public or members; tended to harm the reputation of the profession; and committed breaches of the Act or the bylaws, including the Code of Ethics.

The Court reviewed the procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and manner in which they were exercised and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so, and the burden of previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. HELD: The applicant will have payment for the amount of its claim, interest as provided for in the undertaking and costs of the action. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions."

Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","HELD: The onus was on the defendant to establish negligence on the plaintiff. The plaintiff's inattention rendered her solely responsible for the accident, and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. The defendant suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury, injury to his lower back and knee which hit the dashboard. There was no evidence of a trigger point. The evidence was that the defendant had been driving erratically when he first observed the plaintiff's vehicle approaching from the left and then turned his wheel to the right in an attempt to avoid the oncoming vehicle. The collision occurred at approximately 1:30 a.m. with no interference in visibility, clear, bright, sunny day with no precipitation.  1) The defendant was found to have been travelling erratically at a high rate of speed when the accident occurred. He was not in his lane when the collision occurred. 2) The court was unable to conclude the defendant's negligence. It was concluded that the plaintiff had not been properly trained in the area of the accident and that she had not followed the natural tendency of going into the curve close to the centre line. 3) The Court was not satisfied with the evidence as to the extent of the damage to the vehicles. The court could not conclude that there was any contributory negligence."

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby causing the death of three young flag people. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had no previous driving record. He failed to recognize stopped vehicles in the active construction zone and to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop before colliding with the rear of the Cobalt.  2)The Court considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code, including aggravating and mitigating factors and similar sentences imposed for individuals convicted of dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm. 3)The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant had ever travelled on Highway No. in the Province of Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and, in particular, had ever driven through the construction zone. He was convicted of driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood pursuant to s. 253(b) of the Code of Canada. 4)The Crown did not take any position with regard to the length of driving prohibition or the driving abstract.

The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the petitioner and the respondent. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support of $449.00 per month. 2)The petitioner was prepared in the initial stages to be more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact. It was unfortunate that they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. The petitioner was to have reasonable telephone access with the children and access at other times. 3)The parties were to agree by June of each year on the division of matrimonial property. The respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: ACS seeks an order from the Court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., within seven days of service of the order compelling production of the shares. HELD: The claim for lien is not made out. 1) Given the totality of what is before me, the common opinion is that the solicitor may withhold it from all parties. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. The sheriff has no greater right to refuse production of documents on which he has lien than his client would have if he had the documents in his possession. 3) The court has been thwarted. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, particularly ss. 17-17.2. Upon seizure, the sheriff has the power to sell the shares in order to collect the outstanding debt. 4) The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex and Canada Life commenced this action. The plaintiff counterclaimed that Canada Life acted on appraisals negligently prepared, mishandled the advances on the mortgage and failed to abide by its contract with the defendant. The defendant argued that the documents sought, and indeed all of the defendant's evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] We have concluded that the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the respondent to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. HELD: Appeal allowed. While fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, having regard for the constituent elements of the tort, the pleading was sufficient to answer to the requirements of Rule 173. The allegations of fraud were sufficient in the way of particulars of the alleged fraud. The pleading was insufficient to answer the requirement of Rule 149 but without at least giving the respondent the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations could fairly be struck out as not answering to Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT. The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. HELD: The court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the Court is not bound by the statutory requirement in exercising its power to make orders.  1) The applicant is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. 2) When the error first came to light in 1995, the applicant, the School Division, was asking the court to lapse the caveat. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 3) The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The agreement was concluded in 1996, conditional on subdivision approval, which the Court agreed to obtain at its own cost. 4) The Court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, and judge was empowered under s. 6 of the Act."
b_2011skqb12.txt,"The petitioner brought an application to compel the respondent to pay his pro rata share of the costs for the child's post-secondary education expenses. The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

HELD: 1) The chambers judge ordered the amount of support payable by the father in accordance with the provisions of clause 3(2)(b) by having regard to the actual means and needs of the child and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to his support. However in the face of these concerns being raised by the respondent, the mother has given no evidence to rebut the father's information that she did not attend many of her classes. In my view, the adult child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. 2) Given the issues discussed supra, it is my view that the father should not be ordered to pay the table amount as it is rebuttable, having regard for the actual needs of each child and respective means of the parents."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff was the step-father of the deceased victim. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the defendant. Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident, the plaintiff's claim against him was being defended by the Facility Association which maintains the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia. The emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was not the person insured under the contract. 2) It is not the result that the plaintiff would have been able to recover for mental shock. 3) Although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident she commenced the action to advance a claim for emotional shock. 4) Section 139(2)(b) of the Insurance Act requires that a person be insured under s. 139 (2) (a) and s. 138 (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)(h)(i)(ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)(v)(vi) (ii)(iii)(iv)(e)(f)(g)(j) and (v).(v). 5) The Court concluded that such a result would be impossible for the plaintiff to conclude and that the emotional harm inflicted by the cousin was too remote.  6) The court did not conclude that such an outcome was the result."

The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change.

The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent. The issue before the court is whether the applicant's two bills fall within the period of time allowable for assessment by the registrar and if not, whether it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time allowing for the assessment.

There were discussions between Mr. Postnikoff and Mr. Morrison concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered. The judge has the discretion to extend the time for assessment. 2) The applicant has been paid from monies in trust and the issue in this case is whether it was in the justice's interests to abridge the time and order the assessment of the bill.  3) There was no lawsuit commenced for the collection of the accounts.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","HELD: Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed and the conviction set aside. The court found that the trial judge erred in principle in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the complainant's home and the search of the home, all without a warrant. The record here was insufficient for the court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. The trial judge held that the police had a duty to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and whether the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded. In the circumstances, although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the complainant, to go to the appellant's home, and not to simply leave once the daughter told them at the door that she was fine. The police were justified in checking the house to ensure that there were no other occupants and in searching the complainant to ensure he had no weapon."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises at suite B. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles.  1) The notice to the tenant must contain sufficient particulars of the tenant's boyfriend and the impact his actions had upon the premises and disturbances caused by him had upon another tenant and his daughter. 2) The three days notice given the tenant (including two weekend days of Saturday and Sunday) was insufficient to allow this tenant to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. It is clear that she took the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written response to the landlord’s claim as she knew it to be. She did not ignore the process. 3) The hearing officer was properly served personally. The tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any or adequate opportunity to respond to those allegations. 4) There was no other evidence that the hearing officer considered the tenant”s application for adjournment or dealt with it fairly or reasonably in the circumstances."

To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of a doctor. The first involved proof in Solemn Form (the 'probate action') and the second involved deleting the bequest to his wife. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $3,090,257.00.

Jurisdiction to hear such a case flows from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the Court, pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court. There were myriad factual and legal issues to be considered but perhaps the three most central issues were the wills. The immediate cause of death was mixed drug overdose.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents (Zurich and Sovereign) are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against Westridge and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 2) The amount we will pay for compensatory damages is limited as described in SECTION III—LIMITS OF INSURANCE; Exclusions This insurance does not apply to: b. “bodily injury” or “property damage” which occurs during the policy period. The claims for loss of use of other tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from: (i) delay in or lack of performance by or on behalf of the Named Insured after such products or work have been put to use by any person other than an Insured. 3) Occurrence “Occurrence” includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insurer. The insurer must defend. 4) In Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd's of London v. Scalera, 2000 SCC 24 (CanLII); [2001] S.C.R. 699 at para. 28, in the following terms: 28 The starting premise for assessing whether an insurer’s duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional “pleadings rule”. Whether an insurer is bound to defend depends on the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the form of statement of claim."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner. At trial, both parties were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home. The final paragraph of the judgment reads: ""[18] The parties have been married for over 25 years and are now senior citizens. Given the age of the petitioner, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home."" HELD: 1) No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of Rule 15 and Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide: '15(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of a judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or maintenance for a child or dependant adult. 2) The giving of directions by this court as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of judgment' or the taking thereof in the action and therefore, would not contravene Rule 15. No writ of certiorari or writ of habeas corpus was found. 3) No evidence was found as to the parties' position on the issue of whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The Rural Municipality of Edenwold granted an order requiring the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the Development Officer of the RM dated February 3, 2014. The respondent took no significant steps to comply with the order. HELD: The respondent was found in contempt of court. The only real issue in dispute was the appropriate penalty or sanction to be imposed by the court.  1) The respondent's conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings may not generally warrant an award of solicitor and client costs, but his continued and ongoing unjustified failure to comply does. 2) He has no place other than his home acreage to park his tractor trailers between jobs or to store equipment that he requires from time to time in his contracting business. 3) The court was satisfied that this was a situation that required complete or near complete 'indemnification for costs reasonably incurred'."

The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.

She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","HELD: The court granted divorce under s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. It held the respondent responsible for the payment of matrimonial debts. The parties had lived separate and apart for more than one year and there was no possibility of reconciliation. The respondent was entitled to spousal support in the amount of $1,600. The court found that the respondent was not entitled to any of the funds held in the trust account for the period of cohabitation and that there was insufficient evidence to establish that an equal division would be unfair."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.

6_1992canlii4811.txt,"During a hearing involving an application for custody contested by three parties, the trial judge heard only the appellants' evidence and the direct examination of the natural mother before calling counsel to his chambers and advising them that the hearing was a waste of time and custody should be granted to the natural mother. Counsel for the appellants subsequently put the matter on record and requested the trial judge withdraw, alleging an apprehension of bias. He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances created a reasonable apprehension of bias which resulted in a denial of natural justice. In the conduct and carriage of civil actions the law requires a fair and impartial hearing.","This case concerned a custody application in the Family Court involving two infant children. They were voluntarily placed in the care of the appellants by their birth mother and her male companion who was the natural father of the younger child. In due time the Administrator of Family and Children's Services in the province of Nova Scotia, acting pursuant to S.N.S. 1976, authorized them to apply for the custody of the two children, the elder being about three and one-half years old and the younger fourteen months. The appellants sought custody pursuant to the authority given them by the Minister of Community Services. The natural father and his common law companion wanted the custody to be granted to them but in the alternative, if not to them, then to him rather than his former wife who, as noted, was the birth mother of the child.

The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The plaintiff claimed damages from overhanging trees on his property and whether the trees invade his yard. The defendant argued that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood was generally in favour of them. The plaintiff argued that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was unreasonable and was contrary to the norms of the city. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for damages was allowed to proceed to trial on the basis it was frivolous and vexatious. Even if the plaintiff could prove the debris was solely from the Sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient. There was nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on Mr. Labuick was greater than expected for the community he lives in. The claim for injunctive relief was struck as frivolous. It was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. The court was prepared to strike the portion of the claim with respect to damages from trees falling from the defendant's property onto the plaintiff's property. The issue was whether the debris in his yard was solely a result of the trees."

Rules did not disqualify them from representing the plaintiff in this case. 6)The plaintiffs suffered mental distress as a result of the failure of their real estate transactions to close.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and aggravated assault with a knife. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752(a)(i). The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment pursuant to s752(1)(a)(ii) of the Code. Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the sentence was reduced to imprisonment for term not exceeding fourteen years. The predicate offence is a serious injury offence. The Court held that the offences committed were different and that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of a murder or serious injury. The court also held that a long-term offender designation was appropriate given the circumstances."

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","HELD: The application was allowed and the parties focussed their submissions solely on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s. 66.

It ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two reefer trailers have priority over any other security interest in them.

She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files and were preparing to file a statement of claim. The plaintiff had not explained why she waited five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be re-reserved to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. 2)It repeats an earlier statement that infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. So, an infant should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him in the same action. 3)The applicants' decision to destroy their office files is understandable, but the decision does not recognize a contingent element. The comments contained in Brosseau v. Children's Aid Society of the District of Sudbury Inc. et al (1986), C.P.C. (2d) 312. 4)I have a good deal of sympathy for the applicants in this case. The application raises a number of problems including the fact that the plaintiff waited 5 years after her attained majority to consult counsel. She did not explain why she had waited for five years to reach majority. She also did not provide any evidence as to who took over the plaintiff's files or whether he practised with others who may have his case histories and patient records. It is difficult to believe that there are not medical records available from some source which would outline the scope of the treatment and his diagnosis and prognosis for the plaintiff. That very significant delay is factor that must consider, but only one. Undoubtedly there will be some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of having destroyed their file, the death of Dr. Leakos and the diminution of memories over period of 11 years.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","HELD: The plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract respecting the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff contended that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The defendant asserted that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated to the plaintiff. Plaintiff sued for specific performance and damages. The court accepted the plaintiff's contention that no agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. It must be found as fact exactly what it was that the parties said. The central issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statuting of Fraud's to the land sale agreement. The Court accepts the plaintiff’s contention that a contract was created between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the Subject Quarters. However, the Court accepts that the plaintiff was not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men’ minds."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a concern for his safety after threats had been made against him. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The accused had not satisfied the onus on him under s. 679(4)(a) that his appeal was sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The Court found that the appellant had not met the second condition of being released pending appeal. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, the Court was not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. The appellant's release so soon after being sentenced would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues raised by the applicant's application to vary were retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the respondent's contribution to section 7 (special expenses) for the children. The respondent argued that although the variation application was filed May 30, 2008, his counsel did not receive the relevant documents until October 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The petitioner argued that even if that was not formal notice to the respondent, his blameworthy conduct warrants extending the period of retroactivity to more than three years."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The Plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting of their sister's dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The petitioner was mentally competent and completely able to manage her own financial affairs from 1992 until her death in 1999.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.","FIAT. This application under the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act requires consideration of the following points in relation to the provisions of the Act: 1) The motion materials filed by the applicant are deficient and ought to a least include a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service. The Farm Land Security Board ought to complete it mandatory tasks under Section 12 under the Act and provide its report in the format described in the legislation. The apparent refusal by the respondent to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review as information is available from other sources to deal with the matters in Section 12 (12(a) and (b). The review if necessary could express the limitations evident from any refusal by any refusal. The Board may apply incentives to the respondent by following the procedures in Sections 12(4), (5) and(7) of the act. 2) The application under Section 2 of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act requires a consideration of three points in the relation to provisions of Act; 1) the motion materials are deficient. They ought to include a certified copy of title to the land in question to establish that the 'equitable mortgage' is registered and that the proper parties are before this court. The motion material intended by the applicants to be used to discharge the burden of proof described in Section 18 of theAct. The specific deposition as to whether the land is or has been 'homestead'.

Should not be included; a) copies of the notice of intention, b) the documents preporting to be the 'Equitable Mortgage' to which the materials filed refer. The farmer's motion materials ought to be deficient. 4) Section 20 of the legislation would give the respondent a grace period of 1 year. Information before the court indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues.  5) It is important to note that the issue of whether the respondent will participate in financial review is a matter for the Board to determine. The review would express the limitation evident from a refusal by a respondent to participate. The board may apply incentive to the applicant to participate by following certain procedures in s12(4).

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","HELD: The application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005. The parties were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in 1993. They entered into an agreement in February 1996 that the biweekly payments would be reduced to $2,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father provided financial support directly to the mother. In July 1996, the respondent requested enforcement of the amount in the original order. She received $10,000 in November and December 2005. In January 2006, the Respondent ordered the respondent to pay $16,000. The respondent refused. The court reviewed the respondent's tax returns and found that the respondent had paid $52,000 for the past 10 years. The amount owing under the old order was $29,672. There has been no variation of this order since the Corollary Relief Judgment dated the 24th day of April 1996."

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue in this matter is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The university insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his residency program. HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench is to perform its role as a visitor to the university in accordance with s. 7 of The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995. 1) The respondent was such a student that for reasons which will be outlined hereafter, his third party funding was depleted during the period he was suspended. 2) The College insisted that the respondent, who had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, should not have been dismissed prior to an investigation into the matters that led to him being placed on probation to begin with. 3) There is no dispute that general visitatorial jurisdiction extends not only to judging that the university satisfy standards which are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere but also to assessing the objective reasonableness of the exercise of discretion by those persons charged with administering the internal law, policies and procedures of the university. It is difficult to accept the College's concern that creating an exception in this case would somehow affect the integrity of the policy."

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for two years and had two children.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. HELD: Cross-appeal dismissed. The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. He would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000 but fixed the damages to $25.000. 1) This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle is protected by a defamed statement. The plaintiff's and the Union's complaints were entirely 'unfounded and without substance'. 2) The plaintiff did not know about the mail-out to the Union members. It is now a 21st century reality that the internet and web pages will be used by large organizations (such as this union), to communicate with its membership. 3) There was no evidence that the plaintiff took an active part in harassing the Union member. It was clear that the words refer to the plaintiff and that they were published. The words expressed by the Union would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. 4) The court found that the trial judge made no error in law when he concluded that there was no merit to the grievance and concluded the words were entirely untrue. The court also found the plaintiff had in fact been defamed by the publication of the Grievance Report. 5) The Court concluded that the jurisprudence is circumspect in granting absolute privilege and the scope of the privilege is narrowly interpreted. It would be improper to extend the cloak of absolute privilege to what has been described as'steps preparatory to judicial proceedings' but the purpose in this case was an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. This purpose is not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence. 6) There is a palpable and overriding error standard. The standard of review to apply is correctness with respect to whether an impugned communication is capable of bearing defamed meaning, but whether the expression is in fact defamed is question of fact and, as such, is reviewable on a palpable error standard (see: Torstar)."

The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

Another option was to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there is no lawyer prepared to sign certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons. 2)There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the respondent and the petitioner. When upon the evidence filed the terms appeared to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of the parties, it was the Court's position that the parties should have joint custody of the two children and that they should respect their wishes as to their choice of residence and the time they might wish to spend with each parent."

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the officer failed to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning. The officer observed the appellant swaying in a tight turn as she proceeded from stop sign onto highway leading out of Tisdale. He noted that other car tracks in the soft snow gave the appellant a strong feeling of alcohol on her breath. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol but out of nervousness or other cause. The judge failed to consider evidence that the appellant required no assistance to exit her vehicle, walk to and enter the police cruiser without assistance. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence as found by the trial judge was reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s belief. The court dismissed ground one of the appeal.  2)The appellant contends that the failure of the officer to provide her with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s10(b). The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high.  3)On the first ground, which is factual one, the test is based on an error of law, failure to consider the evidence in its totality and/or an error respecting specific piece of relevant evidence may ground a successful appeal."

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge of stealing a sum of money from a convenience store clerk contrary to s. 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions set out in the probation order. A probation order was imposed. The Crown now seeks leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. HELD: Leave to appeal permitted, the appeal allowed, sentence set aside and in its place sentence the respondent to 2.5 years in the federal institution, followed probation for 1 year. 1) Sentencing must reflect the individual nature of the offence and the offender. 2) There are some mitigating circumstances here they are not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of this offence and its prevalence. The sentence is not fit. 3) The respondent was prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring 5 years after the respondent's release from imprisonment."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner in which the Crown applied for the information was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of control over the accused and not the offence. The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case. The informations sworn in March 2001 and March 29, 2001 in this proceeding were stayed. 2)The special plea did not appear in Saskatchewan until May 2001. 3)The court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. 4)The evidence before the court was inconclusive as to whether the special plea had been accepted in Alberta or whether the Alberta Provincial Court had lost its jurisdiction. 5)The fact that the Alberta provincial court had not lost jurisdiction in Alberta and could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s.485.1 of the Code does not give rise to a successful plea. The police procedure adopted by the police in Alberta amounted to an abuse. 6)There was no evidence to support the claim that the Special Plea of Autrefois Acquit was applicable in this case as it was the province where the offence was committed and the province in which it was committed. 7)The information was sworn in Saskatchewan on March 1, 2001 and brought before the Provincial Court in Lloydminster on March 5, 2001. The respondent had not been summonsed and was not present on that date. The only remedy left is an appeal. In Alberta the charges were deemed to be dismissed for want of prosecution. The jurisdiction was regained in Alberta as result of summons that must have issued within three months of February 6, 2001 (date of loss in Alberta). The Crown now appeals on the following grounds."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving that arrangement pursuant to s. 186.1 of The Business Corporations Act. The plan proposed to distribute the corporation's assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights on dissolution and s. 220 directs that property distributable to shareholders who have 'proven claims in establishing their status as Shareholders rather than having portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA. The purpose of the arrangement was to assist in relieving the Shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide missing shareholders with an opportunity to confirm their status and to participate in the distribution of capital on dissolution. HELD: The court found that s.186.1 was being used by the corporation for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The context within which this was provided must be considered. The proposal was not undertaken for a valid business purpose within the approval criteria set forth in The Companies Winding Up Act.  1)The court found no conflict between the power of the court to approve a proposed distribution and the powers given to the court under s.185.1(4) and (m) of the Act. 2)It is not possible for a corporation that is not insolvent to effect a fundamental change in the nature of an arrangement under any other provision of The Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. It is just and equitable that the court has the power to approve distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or division of the property or assets of the corporation. 3)The Court found no evidence that the proposed distribution was a 'dispute' between the parties. 4)It was not possible to find the court's analysis in BCE to be equally applicable to the proposed arrangement."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track) supports the Plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from a back alley. However, the onus is not on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, the plaintiff has not done so. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 1)The evidence of the town employee called by the Plaintiff is not supported by the evidence. It appears highly unlikely that the offending substance came from gravel used in graveling the alley. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. The back alley slopes from the house to the Charbonneau yard. Defence led evidence of a house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause of the damage. 2)The defendant has access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame. Photographs, as well as the evidence given by Wendell and Sandra, both testified that the cost to him to test for numerous substances until they found the presence of the one killing the grass would have been prohibitive. There is no evidence of what substance got into the lawn and killed it. No samples were taken from the alley to test the chemical substance there. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied that the defendant had anything to do with putting the substance into the alley or that it came from the defendant's property."

HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","The parties were unable to resolve three issues related to the date spousal support should be terminated and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: 1/2 share to each party was ordered for another year. The husband was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to section 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. The value of the property was determined to be $49,000 on the date the action was commenced. In addition, the 6 Cominco Limited shares in the husband's possession were to be sold and the net proceeds divided equally. The respondent's obligation should end on November 30, 1995 and there will be an order accordingly. The $88460 total value for distribution was $103,505. The court valued the property at $48,000. The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. It is illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them."

This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. The trial judge reserved his decision and then found him guilty. The appellant appealed the conviction. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge failed to provide reasons and to enunciate his findings of fact in reaching the conclusion that the appellant 'knew or ought to have known of the effects of the drug that he was taking'.

In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was dismissed. The case was put to the court prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. HELD: The appeal [from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116] must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 1) There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5 rather than question 4. The result is the same, in any event. 2) The Court was in general agreement with the reasoning of Wright J. Although his reasons were clear, there was some confusion regarding the answers to the question questions. The answer to a question 5 seems to be rather than a question 4, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision to the alleged right not to associate. 3) The respondents shall have their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs."

The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The accused was charged with sexually assaulting the complainant between the dates of October 1986 and March 31, 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that the incident occurred long before he became an adult. HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction respecting offences committed by persons under the age of 18 years. The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment. 1)Any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on or after October 22, 1986. The complainant was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had forced sexual intercourse with her when she was or 9 but that he was not able to perform the act. 2)The evidence of the sexual assault did not conform to the age specified in the indictment. The Crown could not find any other evidence beyond that age. 3)The accused had moved to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. 4)The complainant was satisfied that the accused had not committed any sexual assaults while she was a young person. 5)Although the Crown had declined jurisdiction to charge the accused with sexual assault, the Crown could have charged him with assault if the evidence had not been satisfied that he could have stopped the assault on the complainant when he was 11 or 12 years old. 6)The Court had jurisdiction only when a matter was transferred to it pursuant to s.5 of the Young Offenders Act."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. HELD: The accused was found guilty of operating an overweight vehicle on a road to which the minister's weight restriction applied. There was no other notice given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods. The Minister's department placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332 as well as other signs describing an alternative truck route. The signs were located on numerous grid roads in the area. It was not the local municipality to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the minister to provide notice of his order but, in this case, the municipality appears to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal divisions affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in that area that were in the business of hauling. No other notice was given."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of the child alleged to be of 'unsound mind'. HELD: The order was issued. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the mother and she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. In certain jurisdictions Public Trustees have by statute the authority to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. It is significant that the inclusion of the public trustee in the definition of litigation guardian (paragraphs 46(2)(d) and 22(1)(b)) are circumscribed by reference to s32 of The Child and Family Services Act. Therefore the Rules do not enlarge the provisions of the Act and cannot serve as the basis to appoint the public trustee as the personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult."

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party.

HELD: 1)The plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed with costs.  2)The defendant did what it was requested to do and was exonerated by the CRTC for doing so. 3)Nothing was found to be factually correct about the defendant's report on the sexual assault. The fact that the plaintiff's business was on the down side at the time of the assault did not mean that it was the cause of the loss. The evidence was that the defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that news that were aired would cause harm to the plaintiff or to their business and their health. 4)The court found that the defendants published the information that it receives from the RCMP, which is always a reliable source of information. It did not point to the defendants as being responsible for the financial loss by the victim in its roller rink operation."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal of a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code.

8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period, did not appear for the trial of the action. The evidence showed the father had taken no measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years that he developed and coached. There were numerous photos of the accused wearing beaded jackets, moccasins and beaver mitts in spite of the accusations by some that these were taken away and never returned. The court noted that countervailing factors such as the inflammatory nature of the similar facts and whether the Crown can prove its point with less prejudicial evidence reinforced the prejudice inherent in the poisonous nature of propensity evidence."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows: (a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or (b) the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. This is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. The context in which the delay occurred is not such as to lead me to the position that this claim should be struck on that basis. While one year is an excessive period of time, the defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

However, he appears to have had a very bad habit of not paying the child support. Any explanation for this would be considered by the court. 3) Based on the British Columbia Tables, the applicant has an obligation, according to the British Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. 4) The respondent has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely, the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines in order to proceed with his variation regarding his ongoing maintenance payments. 5) Given that the applicant is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment towards the outstanding maintenance payments for the child. 6) For all the reasons set out above, the application was dismissed. 7) The Court would have to determine he has a present inability to pay child support and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay it."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused stands charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called the alleged victim's son, Cory, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, Adam Balicki and another fan as witnesses. HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1) The Court held that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that the bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The accused is responsible for all of the results of the assault which he committed, no matter how unforeseen or how unintentional. 2) In reviewing the case law from other jurisdictions, it is very important to note that the Court of Appeal expressly did not follow R.v. Nurse, (1993), 83 C.C.L. (3d) 546, the decision of the Ontario Court of Court which found that the Crown did have to prove objective foreseeability. It held that the accused driving was a contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range. 3) The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The short period between the assault and bodily harm was closely related in time and otherwise. 4) The answer to the negative question was easily answered in the negative. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up resulting from the assault resulting. The third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendants. 5) It was clear that the two disinterested witnesses to this event were not related to each other. 6) The court concluded that the second question should be answered by the affirmative. 7) The second question was asked in the positive. 8) The third party involved was the same as the accused. 9) The fact that Cory was motionless in the middle of the street during that very short period of time was enough approximate cause for the accused to be guilty of the full offence charged. 10) The offence was more than an insignificant or trivial cause. 11) The Crown did not have to show the accused foresaw or intended the death or serious harm to the victim."

A Queen's Bench Chambers Judge dismissed the application. This decision was appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's determination.,"Fulltext of judgment follows: The appeal, insofar as it is based on s. 180(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act may or may not apply to the judgment held by the appellants, we wish to make it clear that we have made no finding in that respect, since that question was not before us."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the normal criminal rules of admissibility apply and the Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. 2) The Crown called two witnesses to identify the contents of the warrant expiry package as CSC records and to testify about some of the documents. A third witness was called to testify that he reviewed the warrant outiry package and swore the information.  3) The court held that the usual rule of evidence applicable in criminal trials does not apply. 4) The accused was entitled to the disclosure of his or her personal information to the defence. 5) The defence opposed admission of any documents. 6) The trial judge erred in failing to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 7) There was no evidence as to the identity of the witnesses. 8) The judge relied on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 273, where the standard of proof for the trier of fact was reasonable ground to believe. The judge also held that there were reasonable and probable grounds for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. 9) The respondent was not released from custody until the sentence expired in March 2012. 10) The Provincial Court judge did not call the authors of the report nor did the defence seek to cross-examine them. 11) The evidence was not admissible in evidence at the hearing. The Court held that it was not intended that the judge strictly apply the rules of law."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appealed both his conviction and the sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Crown counsel should not have put these questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. 2) The appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision was not objected to when it occurred and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised. 3) In all of the circumstances of this case, Crown counsel clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case, this discretion is exercised on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. However, the appellant was prejudiced by the questions."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, Currie J. declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of a dangerous one. The judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter dated August 28, 2010 to this Court where he said that he did not sexually assault anyone and was falsely accused by the victims who were forced to lie by the police. 2) The defendant was found not guilty of all of the offences and was sentenced to an indefinite period of imprisonment. 3) The court was not bound to accept the experts' assessment of his risk for re-offending. The defendant had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment program which the experts acknowledge is pre-requisite for rehabilitation. 4) There was no evidence that the trial judge overemphasized the importance of protection of the public. For the reasons that follow, the court dismisses the appeal. 5) The judge instructed himself properly on the law and noted the appropriate authorities in order to decide the contested issue, namely the third point in s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code: whether 'there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community'. 6) The Court is not bound by the experts to accept their assessment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The wife applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be put up for sale. The husband opposed the order claiming a reversible error on the part of the Chambers judge in two respects. First, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the house and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; case remitted to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis for rehearing and proper determination. The Chambers judge ordered the sale of the home and ordered the equity in it divided equally after deducting legal fees and real estate commission; second, that the appellant's obligation to continue paying support to the wife (over and above the increased mortgage) shall continue only until the earlier of either the sale or June 2006 (being the day after the June mortgage payment is due)."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.

Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further I am not prepared to rescind any of the payments. HELD: 1) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300 per month non-taxable. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 2) Any delay in enforcement of the ongoing payments would cause hardship to the petitioner; and 7.

The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, the conduct was a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The only conclusion that the Court can draw is that this driving action was planned and deliberate. HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1) The driving was deliberate. 2) The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. 3) The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate on this stretch of road. The driving must constitute a'marked departure' from the standards expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The accused's conduct was clearly deliberate. 4) The Court can only conclude that the driving was planned, deliberate and that the accused was driving within the confines of the s. 49(1) Motor Vehicle Act. 5) The court cannot infer from driving conduct that the offence was planned or deliberate. 6) There is no reasonable doubt that the driver was driving dangerously. 7) There was no evidence as to why the accused chose to accelerate so fast. 8) The officer was not aware of the danger involved in the conduct of the accused."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the certificate. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. 4) There is no evidence that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. It logically follows that where a judgment is filed in this Court that this Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise it discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 6) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that there can be a Court's discretion and provided remedy. 7) The principles and considerations that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding that a judgment of this Court was obtained as a result of the failure of an employer (or for that matter an employee) who has missed the 21 day limitation imposed by s. 62(1) of the Act. The Court is not obliged to grant an extension of time in which to serve a certificate. 8) The court has jurisdiction in Farmers of North America because it was not a 'true appeal' that asked a judge to grant a de novo hearing. 9) The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening of a noting for a default. 10) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, the Court is without jurisdiction"
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his patients' accounts. With one small exception, the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which he enjoyed success at trial. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross appeal must be dismissed. 1) The Protocol and MCIB's related use of the AU code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is obviously an individualized administrative process. However, it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 2) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. In this case, the Protocol is not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA which is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished.' 3) The principles of the Protocol, referred to in s. 18(2)(j) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (the MCIA) are best characterized, perhaps among other things, as means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. 4) The provisions do not amount to a payment schedule uniquely applicable to the physician. They merely set out the circumstances in which further information will be requested. The trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the trial judge failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to physicians dissatisfied with the Government's assessment of their accounts. 5) The protocol ties directly into the “Assessment Rules” portion of the Schedule. It states that accounts may be adjusted if the interval between series of these codes exceeds 100 days, anything less than 100 days should be rejected explanatory code BA. 6) In order to properly assess its merit, it would be necessary to look more deeply at the Schedule as a means of determining whether such reductions should be made. 7) It would be impossible for the Government to look behind the face of accounts presented for payment."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.",This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there was a 'air of realty' to the plaintiff's argument that her injuries had resulted in any ongoing inability of the plaintiff to work in any capacity. Judgement entered against the defendant on the basis that there had to be an air of realism to the defendant's argument. It was not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them.
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","HELD: The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the parties to have custody of their four children. The parties were unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements with respect to the two younger children, who were living with their mother when they were not attending university. The respondent was 65 years of age and retired. He drove a taxi driver from time to time. He also maintained a truck driver's license and drove a cab on a part-time basis. The petitioner was 41 years old. She worked full-time as a daycare worker. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Saint Vincent University. She also earned a Master of Social Work degree from Dalhousie University. Although the parties lived in the same apartment for many years, they moved to Nova Scotia in 2005. They had three children from their first marriage. They were all born in the mother's home and lived with their father for most of their lives. The mother lived with the father when he was in university and the parties' two older children lived with her in the father's home. The father's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money. HELD: 1) The Court held that the children should remain in the custody and primary care of their mother. 2) The court found that there was no evidence that the parties would ever be able to co-parent in spite of the fact that they were all teenagers."

The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of pickled whole herring. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appellant was awarded its costs. 1)The Act has since been significantly amended to allow additional grounds to be raised.  2)The exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are used in the manufacturing process. The function described by the Appellant of the refrigeration equipment cannot, in the opinion of the Minister, be reasonably said to be fully part of production of its product so as to bring it within, subject to the definition in clause 1(ca), the exemption available in clause 10(1)(h)(I) of the Act. 3)Once it has been established that the machinery or apparatus is used directly in the production of a product, this is sufficient.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.

The wording used by parliament was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. There is nothing in the scheme or object of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act that derogates from that basic presumption. 2) The police act must be read in a context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the RCMP Act.  3) The words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where the police officers are employed within the province. It would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by Federal legislation. 4) In reviewing the scheme and object of the police force it is clear that section and section of the Act operate to render the Royal Canadian RCMP officers part of 'police force for Canada' and peace officers 'for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' 5) The language used by the police is clear, wide, unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: 1)The order was granted pursuant to Rule 3-72 and s. 3-84 of the Queen's Bench Rules. In the alternative, the defendants sought to have the plaintiff appointed as a plaintiff and to amend the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed. For the reasons that follow, that application is denied for that reason.  2)The court was satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The court should not terminate the order or revisit the issues which the parties intended to resolve through that order."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. 1) The evidence was excluded because the trial judge found the appellant would not have relied upon the results of the ASD test. 2) The appellant did not know when the respondent had taken her last drink. He knew it was possible that she had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the demand. 3) The Court of Appeal compared the facts in Einarson to those dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bernshaw, supra, and at paragraph 22 concluded that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the test."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to rule regarding three distinct categories of questions asked but designated as undertakings. Former Rule 212 required the production of documents'relating to any matter in question' while former Rule 222 permitted examination for discovery 'touching the matters in issue'. The Queen's Bench Rules now provide that the production obligation is to 'disclose all documents relevant to any issue in the action' (Rule 5-6); and questioning obligation is about information or documents that are relevant to the plaintiff's claim. HELD: The court found that when the plaintiff moved from the words of touching and relating to an issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Rules. 1) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. It is open to the possibility that the plaintiff may have some information that might be relevant to its claim. 2) There may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses as result of the action or to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. However, it is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. 3) The plaintiff is not obliged to provide answers to questions which it refused to answer on discovery. 4) The applicant's refusal to provide a response to a request for an undertaking is not justified. 5) The court was also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the requested undertaking. 6) The application raises questions about the proper scope of production and questioning. The court concluded that matters relating to railcars previously loaded by the plaintiff are not within the scope of questioning."

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.

He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000.

HELD: 1) This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. 2) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of an indemnity by-law. 3) The contest in this case is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. Moreover, the argument is even further removed from those which the Union's by-laws, however the defendant posits that an expansive reading of CUPE National's sby-laws would lead to an immediate judgment against the Union. 4) In this case, the essential nature is precisely that of the dispute between the union and the union relates to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 5) In the forum for this contest the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen’s Bench Rule485 for summary judgment. 6) The dispute is fundamentally different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. 7) In short, this is precisely a type of conflict that is outside the exclusive realms of the labour relations board. 8) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified by the Union under s. 36.1(1) nor is he entitled to compensation for costs incurred by him in advancing his claims in the First, Second and Third Actions.  9) It would be inequitable to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this contest in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts."

The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income.

Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.

The fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire. There were problems with the electrical system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the supervisor. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. The plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the breach.

The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.

She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired.

At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while over.08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2). The Court also held that because the accused was locked in the police vehicle, he was not informed of his rights to counsel until 17 minutes after the demand had been made. Therefore, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of Shire’s vehicle without arresting him, advising him, and/or permitting him to exit, was a violation of his Charter rights.

Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claimed $25,000 for damages for damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. The disclosure statement did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The plaintiff alleged the Defendants had breached its contract with the plaintiff by misrepresentation in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement. HELD: The motion for non-suit was dismissed.  1)The court found that there was no sufficiency of evidence without weighing the evidence or evaluating its believability to see if the plaintiff has established a prima facie case or, as it is sometimes described, 'whether jury, properly instructed on the law could, on the facts adduced, find in favour of the plaintiff.' 2)The Court found that the plaintiff was not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with a vast experience and law degree. It was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law and to defend their position. 3)The plaintiff did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims were not present. She did not suffer any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation, nor was any damage casually connected to any act or omission of the Defendants."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid milk Quota. The defendant alleged that the agreement only refers to the Fluid. The plaintiffs requested the equitable sharing of proceeds from sales of all quota sold pursuant to the agreement. HELD: The agreement was not interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it would be obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The plaintiff alleges that the agreements only refer to a Fluid product and therefore the agreement was only applicable to the sale. The parties agreed that the clause would apply to all milk quotas and not just Fluid, as the agreement provided for the sharing of the value of the quota."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","HELD: The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The defence argued that the'similar fact evidence' had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice as the accused threatened to kill the complainant if she did not drop the assault and sexual assault charges. The trial judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the evidence is extremely prejudicial in nature. It could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime."

Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The paternal grandmother was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. She had indicated to the Society that she was willing to be considered as a placement for the child if the plan to return the child to her mother did not progress as anticipated. In the end, the Court of Appeal Chambers judge decided that under New Brunswick practice, the inherent jurisdiction to add a party for the purposes of appealing should be exercised only by the Court, not the Chambers judge. HELD: The application was dismissed. Having considered the helpful briefs of counsel and the authorities, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade the Court that a judge of the Court in Chambers does not have authority to make the order requested. Even if the Chambers Judge had jurisdiction to make an order, the order would be an order as, in my opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent care ordered appeared likely to proceed. Nothing which had said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of these factual issues."

M. appealed the order of Diehl, P.C.J. pursuant to the provisions of s.37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act permanently committing his three children to the care of the Minister responsible for theadministration of the Act.

The trial judge provided written reasons wherein he carefully reviewed the applicable principles of law and applied them to the evidence before him. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. It was an established principle that an appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable. There was no misdirection on the law or the evidence with respect to the 'governing principles' as set out in Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. E.S.1984, [1993] SCCR 672 at 683; R.G.1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), 88 Sask. R.96 (Sask. C.A.). The transcript of the proceeding before the trial confirmed that there was ample evidence of each child's need of protection as contemplated by s.11 of the act and that the best interests of each Child would be served by a permanent committal notwithstanding that none of them, based on the sparse evidence, is likely to be adopted."

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The defendant was found two-thirds and one-third responsible for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.

Damage to the defendant's vehicle was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant submits that if costs are only awarded to the plaintiff, theAmount Involved should be limited to the actual recovery, namely the sum of $16,666.67.

The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through nation wide outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. For example, the total revenue from sales for the Atlas agency at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, had declined from $700,000 in the early 1980's to $450,000 during 1983-85.

The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.

The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada regarding alleged abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian Residential School.

HELD: In the event that the respondent receives damages from the Government, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. When the respondent has only one asset that could reasonably become source of satisfying claim for the Act, not only his dependants, but society as a whole has an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used first and foremost for such purpose. If the asset is not available for claim, then it is society who will inevitably assume respondent's responsibility."

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.",The Minister sought 13 Orders of Production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the Respondent. The Respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with E.F. her former counsellor. HELD: The documents were to be produced as part of the Minister’s protection proceeding and were not to be disclosed to the public. The Minister was not asked to balance right claimed by parent but was adjudicating claim put forward by the State. The documents sought are relevant because they are confidential. They are also relevant because the Minister must review its case plan on a regular basis. Information from third parties may give the Minister an opportunity to reconsider its position and alter its expectations and plan.

San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim.

It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land.

An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, alleged that the defendant has wrongfully retained the sum of $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. HELD: The plaintiff has been awarded judgment for breach of trust. 1) The written instructions of Mabel to Mabel constituted the establishment of a trust and that Brenda became the trustee.  2) An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer. 3) The instructions were given to Brenda. She apparently took them home with her. She stated that after she had read the notes Mabel did not instruct her orally to provide the cheques to the granddaughters. In 1992, Mabel requested that Brenda endorse three cheques in blank which could be given to the plaintiff if anything happened to her. The following Sunday, Pennefather died, before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The plaintiff died in March 1998 at which time there was still $25,000 in the bank account in the joint names of Brenda and Wanda. 4) In McPherson v. L'Hirondelle, 1927 CanLII 48 (SCC), Newcombe J. for the court stated at p. 435-36: 'A complete voluntary transfer, which would not be a declaration if it appeared that there was an intention by a person to declare either a trust or a transfer, is not a form of trust.'  5) In McIntyre v. Royal Trust Co. (1946), [1946] W.W.R. 210 at 212 (Man. C.A.). Royal Trust had in its possession all of the share certificates of the defendant. The defendant placed $17,500 in the name of Brenda. Mabel placed $8,000.00 in the account a few years later. In 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. The funds were divided by the plaintiff's four grandchildren. 6) The plaintiff's wife and mother of the four grandchildren testified that she had taken the instructions home with them. She also testified that Mabel told her that she was to receive the interest earned on the account. The proceeds of sale were credited to the defendant on Friday."

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision. HELD: The tenant was not denied natural justice and due process by proceeding with insufficient notice of the particulars of the claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. There was a denial of natural justice in this matter. 1)The tenant's claim for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid was patently unreasonable and was not supported by the facts. 2)The landlord was allowed to amend his claim for $3,764.46 although it was not met with sufficient notice to allow him to amend it. 3)The rentalsman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not unreasonable given that evidence. The appeal of the tenant was dismissed."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order. HELD: The father's income was to be determined on the basis of ongoing child support. 1) The father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. For all of these reasons, the severance is included as part of the father’s income. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of his 2008 income. It is clear on the evidence before me that the father agreed, under the distribution of the family property between the parties, to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as a part of his family property division. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The father is paying support on an income which have now determined to be the sum of $270,300. The son is working from the husband's income for 2007. At the time the order was made, the parties were working from their respective income. In light of the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on a basis of a severance package pay when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues. This decision gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. HELD: The appeal was set aside. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines is set aside and the appeal is dismissed. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within the Guidelines; the appellant's income should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott had no business based in the home. The last ground was that the judge erred in finding an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children. In all of the circumstances of this case, we can not see the appellant was deprived of the right of counsel on any issue and we must accordingly find the judge made no reversible errors. However, we do wish to be taken to approve of the procedure followed by the judge, and reaffirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295."

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","This was an appeal from the Small Claims Court adjudicator's decision wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants. The Claimants had commenced an action for breach of contract against the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The Alberta Court did not file a defence and the Respondent obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small claims Court Act."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The Union applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party or as an intervener pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made on September 23 and October 1, 1999, in proceedings brought by the Union against Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendant(s). The Union alleges that the Union is not a party to the proceedings as it is not joined as an amicus curiae or intervener by order of the Supreme Court. HELD: The Union does not have the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court. The Union relies upon Rule 8.02(e)(i) of the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the High Court of Chancery in England. Rule 62.35(e) was apparently not relied upon by counsel for the Union.

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and refusing to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents were Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union Local 662 (the Union). The Union had been organizing employees of the respondent in connection with an application for certification pursuant to the Trade Union Act. The individual complainants were dismissed from their employment because they were members of the Union. The respondent was attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of a trade union or participating in the activities of trade union. To mount an effective attack on the decision, given no more material than the facts of the offence and the length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of ascertaining whether this is an instance where the decision-making process has gone astray."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Municipality indicated they were prepared to assist the parents with all of the extra expenses for food, clothing and any additional shelter expenses caused by the birth of their grandchild. The applicant's stepfather, who was the head of family and maintaining the household, opposed the application. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that although the provision allows the municipality to consider support for an unmarried mother pending birth, it is not mandatory but rather discretionary. In defining persons in need the committee must have regard to s. 19(e) of the Act and s. 1(m) and 2(1)(d) of Municipal Assistance Regulations."

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, have any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court of Appeal held that the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. It was difficult and sometimes dangerous for the accused to place much reliance on the evidence of witnesses, including complainants and accused persons, who come into court and testify about events that arose from drinking alcohol as a beverage or abusing drugs. The only defence raised by the accused was that he honestly believed he had the consent of the complainant to have sexual intercourse. This defence triggered the legislative response found in s. 33(2) of the Code. It is difficult to understand how someone who renders themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent."

He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"FIAT. The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.  1)In this case the picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably-justified as a condition of release of him from custody.  2)If the amendment was granted as sought by the accused, there still remained a substantial likelihood he would commit a criminal offence or an act of interference with the administration of justice."

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, the accused requested that the Court enter into a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter were infringed. HELD: 1) There was no evidence to establish the accused did not speak to the complainant. The accused's continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a 'de facto' arrest as described in Latimer. There is no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'unarrest'. The accused has not established he was the subject of a 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his right to a free and fair trial.  2) The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported arrest, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. There was, in the words of Lamer C.J., de facto arrest."

He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The Commission ordered an investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House Inc., a company of which Mr. Potter is President, CEO and Chair of the Board.

The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.

The appellant contends that he was unaware of an accident taken place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties were to share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent applied to vary the existing order to include Bridgewater. The parties had been involved in the parenting of these children for several years and had made significant efforts to improve their relationship with the children. However, the respondent now sought interim custody. HELD: The Court found that it was not in the children's best interests to remain in the respondent's residential care beyond the end of the school year. The Court also found that the respondent had demonstrated an indifference to the best interests of both parties.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006.

c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spouse amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The respondent argued that the amount should now be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement exceeded $1,000. HELD: The variation application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The fact it has now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, receiving order ought not to have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt asserts that the builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and can pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise ifthe home is sold and the proceeds divided among the claimants. The trustee maintains the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not effect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home. There are other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early next week. The bankrupt has been far from model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of administration of the estate. HELD: The application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed. 1)The bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If, as the bankrupt states, an annulment of the assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed and the defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. The issue was not plead in defence although the parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework of this summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of the sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act.

The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit in the downtown warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. Building permits had not been obtained nor had condominium titles been raised at the time of sale. The appellant sold the unit to a third party purchaser at a cost of $25,000. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs. 1) Despite the manner in which the issues have been framed by the appellant, the preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. 2) The appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent. 3) The Chambers judge did not err in holding the agreement for the sale of the condominium was not in existence now and was unnecessary to address the issue whether specific performance was available.

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","This is an appeal from conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s255(1) and s253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 2) The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide sample of his breath, thereby infringing his right under ss. and s. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was in a rollover accident and was intoxicated. The Crown appealed the decision following a voir dire on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused testified that after the rollover, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. HELD: The accused's statements were self- incriminating and conscriptive. There was no violation of his Charter rights. The evidence obtained, the self-incriminating statements, that were made under compulsion of statute had been excluded. If the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self incriminating statements to the officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires him to exclude those statements. 1)The evidence obtained was self-initiative and self-recriminating and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. 2)The accused's statement about the accident and his rights to counsel and his right to counsel were not violated. 3)There was nothing to be said about the accused following up on those excluded statements. 4)On the other hand, the statements in particular were so incriminating that they must be excluded from the trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The admission would render the trial unfair if the accused's rights were violated. 5)The officer's admission would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 6)The Crown argued that if he accepted that the accused was given a police warning, then it would be clearly clear to him that he had not had a reasonable expectation that he would not be charged with a crime. 7)The defence argued that the evidence obtained by the officer was as the result of a breach of his section rights and that he understood the warning. 8)The Court held that the Crown was acting in good faith. The officer did not place the accused under arrest, give him a warning or make the blood demand. 9) The accused was co-operative throughout. 10)The police were instructed to exclude the statements that came about after the arrest, the warning and the demand for the blood. 11)It was not necessary to concentrate on the fact that the statements were made in"
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning in relation to either witness. The pivotal evidence implicating the appellant in the murder of his common law spouse and friend came from the testimony of Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. The appellant's appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that the trial judge had erred in law by failing to give the appellant a warning when the circumstances required one to be given. In his appeal to this Court, the appellant argues that the jury should have been able to rely on the appellant's expert opinion as to dangers inherent in his testimony. For the reasons that follow, the Court would dismiss the appellant’s appeal. 1) The appellant was found guilty of the second degree murder of Mr. Byer following a trial before a judge and jury. The evidence raised by the expert was not corroborated by the evidence at the scene. The testimony of the appellant and Windrum was not the only evidence that could be drawn from the expert evidence. The jury should be able to place reliance upon the evidence of Saxon, Windrum without guidance from the judge. 2) There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and the importance of the evidence to the Crown. The scientific evidence did not, contrary to the submissions of the Crown and the Crown, support the version of events given by the appellant. 3) The evidence was not found to be of any danger to the appellant, but rather that the appellant was exposed to the danger posed to the public by his testimony to both witnesses. 4) The court found that there was no error in law in giving the appellant warning. It was not an error to give a warning in the circumstances where it was necessary."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT: This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in April 1998. In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. HELD: The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of the Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for the costs of the defendant in the sum of $18,000 (assuming the counterclaim is wholly distinct from the claim). 1) The respondent commenced another separate and distinct action in January 1999. All matters arising out of the same motor vehicle accident and include all the parties involved in that accident. At least insofar as Saskatchewan Power Corporation is concerned, the party against whom an order for security for cost is sought is a party. However, if the respondent is successful in full or in part in its claim against the applicant as defendant, it would be entitled to set this off against anything the applicant recovered from it in his claim as plaintiff. 2) In the case of Speciality Steels, (supra), reference was made to the decisions in Athabasca Realty Co. Ltd. v. Lafontaine et al. (1981), 30 A.R. 581 (M) and Junction Engineering Ltd. (1993), 143 A.S. 316 (M). In the first there is an extensive review of decisions which discuss the issue of ordering security. It is important to look to the overall situation in order to decide what is just and fair. 3) There is no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue and in general terms the statement of Madam Justice Fraser is just as applicable to an Ontario case as an Alberta one. The second observation is that many of the costs will be related to the plaintiff's claim. 4) The plaintiff is called upon to defend the within action brought by the plaintiff. This is case where the plaintiff not only is non-resident party, but there is a real likelihood that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful."

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT.

The sum paid for the action was not allocated to any head of damages so that those issues would have to be traversed. The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. HELD: A non-custodial sentence was justified. 1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, I must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. The accused refers to the new sections in the Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-violent sentence.  2)The accused has no prior criminal record. His actions have affected him so gravely that he is on the verge of nervous breakdown. The defence claims the accused has abstained from alcohol and states he will never consume it again. 3)The sentence must be served in a provincial correctional centre.

The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial either in French or English pursuant to Section 530(3) contrary to the Criminal Law. The appellant's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his Rights to Trial in his own language is not procedural error.

The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.

The parties lived together for twelve years from 1975 to 1988. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home, furniture and car. The defendant owned four separate properties in their joint names, two of which were sold while they were still together. For most of the years they lived together, the plaintiff paid all of the household expenses with the exception of the $20 per week that the defendant contributed towards the food. For the four years the parties resided in the mobile home the plaintiff earned $17,409.00. In addition to the causal connection between the contribution and the property, the evidence must establish that the plaintiff, that is the person alleging the unjust enrichment, had a reasonable expectation of receiving an interest in the property and the defendant knew or ought to have known of this expectation. The constructive trust is one remedy which may be found appropriate when a finding of unjust enrichment is made. It is not defeated by the existence of a matrimonial relationship between the parties but, for the principle to succeed, the facts must display an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic reason 'for the enrichment'. The respondent has met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment."

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere with the decision of a board of arbitration unless it was 'patently unreasonable'. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable, though this points in that direction. The conclusion respecting its unreasonableness must stand on its own, without being propped up by the reasonableness or correctness of the Pool interpretation or, for that matter, by its own wrongness."

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. mortgage even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent.

The appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA.  2) The Court of Appeal did not agree that by virtue of the filing of its caveat, the respondent obtained priority over the appellant by virtue only of prior registration. It relied substantially on the decision in Royal Trust Co. v. H.A.

8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.

A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. HELD: The application was granted. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances particularly because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. There is no publication ban of these proceedings. The public may attend the hearing, should there be one, and it may attend to hear any oral decision rendered or read the written decision. It will understand how the court conducted its business. Any attempt to collect the required disclosure, while removing identifiers so that they would be provided when necessary but remain undisclosed to the public, would be cumbersome and costly to the parties and to the court."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appeals a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer on the following two questions of law: 1) that the respondent misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Act in finding the tenancy agreement was not fixed-term agreement and 2) that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month. The respondent vacated the unit on or about October 30, 2012. The monthly rental was $2100. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to re-renting it. He purchased a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month, which was $400 more than when the apartment was unfurnished. The hearing officer concluded the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise was failure to mitigate, and that the one month notice provision was applicable. This decision was made not with respect to the possibilities of renting an unfurnishable premises as of September 19, 2012 but was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with fishing for or for sustenance in violation of s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, 1995. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused was not guilty of the actus reus and that his evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence. The court also found that there was no evidence to support the charge that the fishing was an issue within the purview and discussion of the parties."

The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The central issue was identity. The accused wrote a letter to a fellow inmate within one month of the trial. The letter was direct evidence that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and was corroborated for the identification evidence of the accused. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)Of course, the letter is not an alibi. It is an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate a alibi by perjury. 2)His letter is direct evidence of his being at the Club the day before the robbery. 3)The adverse inference against the accused is that he attempted to induce the potential witness by perjury because he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months after the robbery, and is corroborated by the testimony of the other witness. 4)The letter admits fact which is against his interest. The adverse inference is that it is tantamount to an admission by the accused that he wasn't at the club the day the robbery took place. 5)The accused's letter is a direct result of his attempt to deceive the Crown into thinking he was the person who committed the robbery because the Crown had no other explanation for the robbery other than the fact that the accused was armed with a knife and that the Crown could not prove he was in the Club that night. 6)The only conclusion drawn from the letter was that the offence was committed to deceive and that it was motivated by a desire to deceive. 7)The evidence was not conclusive. The evidence was circumstantial. 8)The admissibility of the letter could not be drawn with mathematical certainty. 9)It is not a lie to lie. The Crown could never prove the robbery was carried out to the fullest extent of the criminal justice system. 10)There was no evidence to support the Crown's argument that the letter admitted fact which was against its interest."
5_2002skqb213.txt,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The parties were at odds as to whether the wife's income had been affected by cohabitation with a new partner. HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal Support was varied to $3,500 per month effective May 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. This is the standard of review prescribed in the parties' interspousal contract of September 14, 1999. FIAT The only material change was the fact the wife was residing with her new partner who paid rental income and that certain of his expenses for travel and auto expenses were now paid by the company. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. (The wife suffers from MS and is unable to work). The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The husband's income has increased roughly 50% even without regard to the shareholder bonus."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' (as they both described the relationship in their respective affidavits) for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. HELD: Appeal allowed; s. 15(1) declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect; declaration suspended for twelve months per reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Roscoe, JA. concurring. 1) The essence of being unmarried of not having contracted marriage in the manner recognized by the state in the sense of the federal Divorce Act is that it is an analogous ground upon which to base a claim of discrimination on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. It is not a matter which should be excluded from Charter consideration on the ground that its recognition would trivialize the equality guarantee. 2) The respondent was present during the hearing of this appeal but made no representations.

c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","HELD: 1) The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. Art and Laura opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. The Court was of the view that an adoption plan is unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. Where the Court is of that view, it may make a long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until the ages of 18.  2) The Court reviewed the issues affecting with the boys and the old file that dealt with Melody and her two sisters. It was concluded that the children did not pose a risk to the children."

At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking, possession of cocaine (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking and possession of bodily substances (cocaine) for trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was also found to have a previous drug related record, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. HELD: 1) The accused was given credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody. The amount of money found in the trailer was part of the proceeds of crime found to be in his possession when he was arrested and of which he was being found guilty. 2) The court gave credit to the defence of the accused for his failure to provide and the Crown was authorized to take from him the number of samples of bodily substance reasonably required for a forensic DNA analysis. 3) In addition to the sentence of incarceration imposed, the accused was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, to the Crown. 4) The Court gave the accused credit of 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment, which provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate of the couple, as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. The petitioner argued that the 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate and that the petitioner's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels the Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. 1)Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. The material change threshold has not been met. The existing access order allows the petitioner to define the extent of access or time spent with each of her parents. The title evidence would indicate that if such proceedings were instituted they did not conclude and the mortgage was paid out and the arrears of child support were cancelled. 2)The petitioner is now 15 and presumably all the wiser than she was two years ago. There is no evidence that she has spent more time with her father than she has with her mother. 3)The respondent is not a candidate for joint custody and shared parenting."

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","This case involves a professional negligence claim being advanced by the plaintiff against her former solicitors, Michael Tochor and E. F. Anthony Merchant (as well as a related corporate defendant).

She then commenced this action against her solicitors for negligence. She elected trial by judge and jury and to be self-represented. The trial began April 21, 2003. The plaintiff has been in possession of the defendants' notice to produce their intended expert legal witness and the nature of his intended testimony since December 2002 when the Notice of Expert Witness was served upon her. The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by her in the evidence that she has presented. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts. She chose not to do so.  2) The evidence, which if left uncontradicted, upon which a reasonable jury (i.e. trier of fact) properly instructed, could find negligence and causal connection between that negligence and the alleged injury and consequent damages. There is no expert evidence that has been presented by the plaintiffs to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to decide on this issue. 3) The court found that the standard of care that is applicable in professional negligence cases is a question of law and to that extent it is the responsibility of the trial judge to articulate that standard as part of the judge's charge. It is these matters along with Mr. Merchant's failure to personally conduct Ms. Palmer-Johnson's defence that constituted, in the main, the substantive basis for the plaintiff's negligence claim against the defendants."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The Crown applied to have the complainant admitted into evidence oral statements made to her neighbour and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents.

Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way, she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.'s parents for an indefinite period of time. The Minister also suggests a temporary order. The issues in this case are relatively straightforward and can be identified with two questions: 1) Is the child in need of protection? and 2) if so, what is the appropriate order to serve the child’s best interests. HELD: The Court found that the Minister’ s. 3, 4, 11 and 37 statements were not supported by the evidence. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the Ministry had been able to place a sufficient level of stability in the child, despite the fact that the child had been exposed to domestic violence and a severe domestic disharmony that was likely to result in physical or emotional harm to the child. The Ministry‘s position was clear. The child had a long history of drug use and had been involved in prostitution for several years. The father was charged with criminal harassment for failing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to succeed."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Crown did not promise that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the Schafer case. 2) It is common ground that the Crown takes the position that it is not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. 3) The application raised substantively the same question as that previously considered and determined adversely to the applicant. The Crown relied on the assumption that it preferred to wait the outcome of the trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial. 4) In some cases, the Crown frankly concedes that it may appear to make findings favourable to Leibel but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). However, once particulars were supplied, it would consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590, if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court of Appeal held that an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. The evidence did not provide precise information as to when construction of the greenhouses started and the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The Court found that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purposes of trafficking. Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was obtained from the commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The plaintiff had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction from two mortgage brokers, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the next forthcoming mortgage advance from the mortgagees of the project. At the meeting, the plaintiff requested postponement of the mortgage advances in order that the funds may be diverted to other creditors.

HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) and s. 679 of the Criminal Code so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania is represented by the Attorney General for Canada. The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. The Crown concedes that the applicant has met this low threshold. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. In this case, the elevated risk of flight in light of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by a community-based sentence, the nature of the sentence and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The applicant's s. 43 submissions to the Minister are not frivolous.  2) Romania's submissions are well-argued and directed to the issues at hand. 3) Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings mean that must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance in this case more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Extradition Act."
e_1994canlii4929.txt,"The Wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and periodic maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage, aged 16 and 13. The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest. The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the husband from contacting her and going to her workplace. An interim order granted exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband is required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the husband was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. HELD: The application was granted and the respondent was prohibited from contacting the applicant. A pre-trial date was set for both parties.  1)The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband has been earning money which enables him to pay periodic support. She now asked that she be paid half the value of the crop, $200 per month for each of the children, retroactive to July 1, and that the husband be denied the right to enter the tools shed and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. 2)The husband was found to have been collecting farm machinery and farm machinery since the date of the interim order. He had not offered any of the money earned to support his children. Any driving he had done was to help his son and drew no wages for it. He said he was looking for work but because he is old, he doesn't expect to find any work. 3)The respondent was found guilty of breach of probation."
1999skqb17.txt,"The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. It applies to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application for leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court is granted. 1) There may well be some delay by allowing the third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. 2) The applicant has not established prejudice. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. 3) Pre-trial was ordered by consent of the parties. The applicant had not exchanged documents and the plaintiff gave notice of his intention to amend his statement of claim after the consent order was granted. It was contemplated by the parties that if settlement was not achieved, further steps would be taken the parties agreed through correspondence that: ""Should settlement not be reached at pre-trial, either party may take any further necessary steps that such party deems necessary to prepare for trial..."". 4) The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceeding, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. 5) There is no evidence that the inherent delay is inordinate by allowing third parties proceedings. 6) The claim has a long history. It is not established that the plaintiff has established prejudice by allowing them. 7) The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as third party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant. Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action brings by former student at a residential school is different in nature. It may cover a different time period and/or different employee so that the extent of the third parties' involvement will vary from case to case. The parties' liability will have to be determined on a case by case basis."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. 2) The defendant put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of seven months. Taking all factors into account, it seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship.  3) The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function."
2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused, and immediately took steps both to assist the accused by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused did not swear at the officer and did not threaten to sue him and cause him to be fired from his employment. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that the accused's driving was careless. It held that, given the circumstances, he could not have reasonably concluded that a person would have been so close in front of him and that the officer did exercise due diligence. 3) The evidence of the police officer who was on duty at the time of the collision did not support the Crown's case. The Crown's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to Mr. Tyndall or Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking Mr. Kuchar, and that distance was at most one foot. Neither was waving their arms or giving any other cause for concern other than the officer's statement to his wife saying 'that vehicle could slow down' and the defendant did not appear to be waving his arms or give any other reason other than that he was asking the officer if he needed an ambulance. 4) There was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by the Crown and defence witnesses. The court was satisfied that the Crown had proved that the driving by the accused was careless on this charge. The Court held that it was open to the accused to prove that he exercised due diligence or took reasonable care."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal has an obligation to defend. On November 19, 1993, the appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend the action because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided the issue of indemnity when he engaged in determination of whether the policy'might' provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings. The chambers judge made no error and the appropriate scope of the inquiry was broader than that envisaged by the Court of Appeal. 2)The court was in a good position to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act. However, it would be rare to find a case in which the insurer was under no duty to defend when the policy clearly did not provide coverage. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench judge found that the mere possibility that a claim advanced will fall within the coverage of the policy imposes a Royal duty."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications was validly obtained and executed in a bona fide way and evidence of other offences gathered during the valid process was admissible. 2)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 3)The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive evidence because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the alleged offence would be obtained through the interception sought. 4)The respondent consented to have her private communications with the accused intercepted in order to assist the police in the investigation of the offences outlined above. 5)The Crown argued that because the wiretap evidence was obtained outside of the framework of the authorization, unless the Crown can prove the evidence would have inevitably been discovered, admission of that evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 6)The trial judge did admit that he had sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. However, after analyzing the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities, the evidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be exclusion."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.
