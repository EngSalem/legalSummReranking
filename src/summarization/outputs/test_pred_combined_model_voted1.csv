The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in May 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch' the child every second day and that after that the respondent had access to her every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. Since then, the child has resided with the petitioner. The respondent wishes to change the status quo on an interim basis to have Keanna reside with him every second week. HELD: 1) The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the extent that the petitioner has 'exercised access with their daughter on fairly regular basis'. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in Keanna's best interests. The affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives satisfy the court that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. 2) The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application. The child's current living arrangements are of no assistance in determining the specific time periods wherein the respondent purported to have had plenty of access to the child.","As a result, interim orders usually reinforce the status quo in an attempt to reflect on the best interests of the child.

The issue to be determined is whether, despite the claim of self-defence and evidence adduced in support thereof, the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt any or all of the Criminal Code charges against him, being that of aggravated assault, by wounding Roger Simmons, contrary to S.268; that of assault of Roger Simmons by using or threatening to use a weapon, contrary to S.267(a); and that of possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to S.88. It would have been reasonable for Mr. Simmons to have believed Mr. Colley to be a trespasser and thereby, in accordance with S.41(1) of the Criminal Code, justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. [18] Mr. Simmons, on the other hand, as a person in possession of real property, was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary. In light of how Mr. Colley saw Mr. Simmons’ intention to use the rifle or shotgun, I am unable to believe that Mr. Colley could ever have thought that he was facing an imminent attack when Mr. Simmons stepped toward him holding the knife or that Mr. Simmons would throw the knife at him if he retreated fully from Mr. Simmons’ property. [21] In conclusion, I find Mr. Colley guilty of all three charges. However, based upon the principles expressed in the R. v. Kienapple (1974) 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 decision, a conviction should enter upon only the S.268 aggravated assault.",0.3898635477582846,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s.268(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused claimed that he struck the accused in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the accused intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the complainant causing him to suffer wounds. The issue to be determined is whether, despite the claim of self defence and evidence adduced in support of the Crown, the accused was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault, assault by wounding and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to ss.267(a) and s.88.

b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had taken the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) Claims Centre and an SGI adjuster appraised the damage to the vehicle. The insurer deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The 20% deduction for depreciation amounted to $503.73. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) of the Act amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair the vehicle, regardless of the cost to repair or replace the exhaust system as fixed by regulations. 2)Where an insurer acts for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of loss or damage, or to substitute a different mode of discharging their liability, the insurer is deemed to have elected to reinstate. This is not an election under which it is bound to pay or reinstate by its conduct. There may be a binding election by conduct where the insurer has so conducted themselves as to mislead the assured into thinking that they intend to reinstate. However, this is not the case here. A reinstatement under a motor vehicle insurance contract is a different election under the Act. An election under a different type of insurance contract (e.g. fire, burglary, plate glass, steam boilers, etc.) refers to the formal preliminary proof of loss and not to the actual value of the property damaged or destroyed. 3)The definition of an 'election' has received its own treatment. It may be made an express term of the policy that the insurers are not called upon to elect, unless and until they have obtained all the necessary information, and all such plans and estimates as may be deemed necessary or expedient. The statutory scheme is quite clear. 4)Reinstatement clauses are included in insurance contracts for the benefit of the insurer. The benefits to the insurer are that a reinstatement clause provides the insurer with an option to choose the least expensive means of complying with the insurance policy. In Lepin, the basis for finding an election to repair was the insurer's conduct as manifested by its control over the repairs and repairers. It is not unreasonable to expect that the insurer would elect to repair a vehicle if and until it had all the materials before them requisite for their guidence [sic] in deciding which of the two courses open to them would be more advantageous. 5)An express election is not necessary. An insurer's election to fix is an election.","This is a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased

It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each party and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that she is uncertain where she and the father may be residing in the future. 3) The father is currently residing in an apartment in Alberta with his father. His current residence is two and one-half blocks from the nearest school. During the course of their relationship, the mother would often telephone the police, the RCMP, the Alberta Police Service, the Department of Community Resources and Employment (DCRE) and the Alberta Health Services. The father currently works seven days a week. During this time, he has been living in the apartment with his mother and attending classes at SIAST. The mother has recently moved from Moose Jaw to Alberta. She is currently working seven days week and plans to move to Calgary in the fall. 4) The parents have agreed that Hayley will be their child's primary caretaker. Their intention is to have the child live with them for the duration of her life so that she can get used to living with her mother. Their current circumstances are complicated by the fact that each party has chosen to move from their Moose Jaw residence to a different city.","The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. J. O. now seeks an order of this Court granting her specified access. [94] In weighing the conditions for a custody order as s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 requires, and in reflecting upon the Court of Appeal’s guidance as quoted from Haider v. Malach, supra, as well as [S. (H.) v. S. (C.)], supra, and further upon reflecting on the summary of law quoted at para. 49 of Gordon v. Goertz, supra, as some of those portions pertain to an original application for custody, I find that G. K. and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of two years. [100] For the above and present reasons, G. K. must be the sole custodian of Hayley. However, he must consult C. H. when contemplating any major significant decision in Hayley’s life—whether the issue is education, health related, spiritual, or where a decision will have a major impact upon Hayley’s growth or development. C. H. must give G. K. 10 days advance notice of when she will exercise this option. [109] I have no hesitation in finding that J. O. is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley’s life given her previous role in raising the child. [117] I am satisfied that J. O. is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley’s life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley’s parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the Court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. When the Court considers the quality of the relationship that has and continues to exist between Hayley and J. O., I am satisfied that an independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley’s best interests. Though there is a scarcity of evidence about Hayley’s personality, character and emotional needs, the history and intensity of Hayley’s relationship with J. O. weighs in favour of specifying access for J. O. It is not within J. O.’s right of access to interfere with G. K.’s parenting and C. H.’s access as defined and determined in this judgment. J. O. must refrain from any criticism of either G. K., Patricia Kuntz, or C. H. in Hayley’s presence. To therefore balance these competing claims, J. O. shall have Hayley the last weekend of each calendar month commencing 5:00 p.m. Friday and ending 8:00 p.m. the following Sunday where such weekends do not conflict with C. H.’s access.",0.38909541511771994,"The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father.

2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.

He was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the sum of $61,608 from the date of judgment.  1)The plaintiff was an organic farmer from the Kamsack region of Saskatchewan. At the time of entering into this contract, he had the necessary certificates of conformity required to be certified organic in Canada, the United States and Europe. The documents submitted by Bio Canada, purportedly copies of the German documentation, were not admitted into evidence. 2)There was no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of the entire sum owing to Wlaswich. There was no evidence that the farmer had complied with his contractual obligations to the company, was required to provide oats with a certain quality standard, or that there was nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed.  3)Wlaswich was aware that Bio Canada was reselling his oats. Bio Canada did not explain how they came to pay him $10,000 even though it was not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the company.

The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions.

Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.

In issue is approximately $20 million in legal fees, disbursements and interest which MLG is claiming, and the prospective respondent seeks verification of the claim. MLG challenges the Administrative Judge's order ordering MLG to contact ESI Software, Inc. and arrange for ESI to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation.

[1] The prospective appellant, Merchant Law Group LLP (“MLG”), seeks leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in Chambers dated December 11, 2012. [32] Contrary to the argument of MLG, the Administrative Judge did not err by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI without sufficient information and without due process. [36] Finally, there was no error by failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. Decision [38] I am in agreement with the argument of the prospective respondent and leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG’s fee is reasonable and equitable.

The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions for directions. The appellant argues the CAP was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the applicant to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation.

Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear. The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal from the dismissal of an application to strike out the respondent's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appellant argued that the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law by not striking out the originating notice of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The appeal was allowed on three grounds: 1) the application was not made promptly or in time; and 2) the appellant had not satisfied the Court that it was plain and obvious that the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable causes of action; the issue of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear in law (the foundation of Justice Hart’s decision); and 3) the Court had no further involvement with the matter.","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed, in part, per reasons for judgement of Pugsley, J.A., Hallett and Freeman, JJ.A., concurring. [1] The narrow issue in this appeal is whether the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike out the respondent’s statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The court therefore declines to strike the statement of claim under CPR 14.25(1)(a). Dealing with the third argument of the applicant, in the Court’s view there is no abuse of process based on the principle of res judicata. In summary, the applicants have not satisfied the Court that it is plain and obvious that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action and would therefore dismiss the application. [25] The appellants apply for leave to appeal, and if granted, appeal from the judgment on the grounds that Justice Tidman erred in law by not striking out the originating notice and statement of claim: [94] In conclusion, it is my opinion, that the claims advanced against the Board, and the individual appellants (other than chairman Darby), clearly arise from actions taken in their capacity as Board, or as Board members, and that those actions are protected by the statutory immunity. [112] In my opinion, Justice Tidman erred when he:
- concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the Court in a s.14.25 application;
- determined that the constitutional question posed by Future Inns had not yet been clearly answered by the courts;
- determined that the extent of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, except for the allegations against chairman Darby, was unclear.

9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve land contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 1) The defendants had been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 2) Although the defendants' activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as it was an abuse and violation of the rights of the people involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 3) The only regulation made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: “A public reserve or municipal reserve may be used for any purpose that would facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area.” 4) The actual wording of the charges to so describe them was that: 1) Prior to the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the Municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. The municipality did not seek permission from anyone. Rather, it took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. The civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves were not directly in issue. The Municipality stepped into that position. 5) The municipality was responsible for maintenance on public reserves, not policing Sec. 197 and, in some cases, for the development of boathouses and other constructions. In the event of widespread violations, great expense and controversy was predictable. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce.","THE ISSUE 1) The Defendants are charged with permitting a private building or facility, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of Sec. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983, and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. 3) They say the bylaws of the Resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded “equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination …” under Sec. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It may be that a municipality might seek to even further restrict permitted uses on the strength of its rights as a land owner, but I do not see how it could have jurisdiction to allow uses not permitted by Sec. 197. 98) Council also took the view that prosecution in respect of boathouses instead of other apparent violators, such as shed owners, was appropriate because it was boathouses that had resulted in the complaint, and they were a very private use, analogous to sheds, whereas with respect to other uses, such as walkways, docks, firepits, etc., it could be argued did not violate Sec. 197, as they could at least be utilized by the public at large. 108) The defendants see the selection of themselves as the only ones to be prosecuted out of such a large number of apparent violators, for no reason that they believe could be viewed as sufficient, as, in itself, unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of Sec. 15 of the Charter. Applications made by the defendants to the Department of Parks for permission to build things on the foreshore, which were based on misleading diagrams, are not material to the public reserve. 141) The case turns, as they themselves say, on the question of whether it is an abuse of the legal process to prosecute them when so many other apparent violators have not been charged, or a case of violating their rights under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 159) Secondly, a restrictive interpretation does not give the defendants a defence to the charge in any event, as their boathouses are not open for use by the general public. 160) In short, they have constructed a private facility on a public reserve. That is not a permitted use under Sec. 197, even interpreting it as Mr. Nanson does, and, accordingly, their boathouses are illegal under Sec. 221(1)(a)(ii). I find that council proceeded against the defendants it chose because it seemed sensible to them to do so, not because of any mala fides. 202) If I am wrong in concluding that the delay did not prejudice the defendants, the delay which I find to be unsatisfactorily explained was by that of the Department of Municipal Affairs, not the council. However, in my view, there were no unreasonable post charge delays in this case, given its complexity. 208) Thus, in my view, there is no reason to stay these proceedings on the grounds that they constitute an abuse of the legal process, least of all when the defendants, along with other apparent violators, deliberately took their chances on being prosecuted. 214) I know of no decision that says that it is discrimination, contrary to Sec. 15, to pick out individuals to prosecute as a test case to ascertain the state of the law, where there is no evidence that it has been done on the basis of improper consideration such as personal characteristics. In my view, there has been no showing of the type of discrimination prohibited by Sec. 15. 222) Picking out boathouse builders rather than shed builders is not an example of discrimination of the type prohibited by Sec. 15, as I understand it and the case law. 223) Thus, in my view, Sec. 15 has not been violated and no stay of the proceedings should be granted on the view that it has been. 226) Thus, in my view, the proceedings should not be stayed, because there has been no violation of Sec. 15 and, if I am wrong in that regard, because, in any event, it is not “appropriate and just” that such a remedy be granted in the circumstances present here.",0.469067405355494,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of s197 of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  They claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The municipality did not deny the existence of a boathouse on a public reserve. 2) It did not seek permission from anyone. 3) The Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 4) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. 5) In some cases, however, cottage lots did go to the high water mark. 6) However, in some cases cottage lots do not go to that level. 7) In others, old cottage lots exist immediately beside newer ones which are behind public reserve which, as far as the appearances of the matter are concerned, are part of the private lot. 8) There are access walkways to such public reserves, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey. One would not be likely to realize that the public reserve existed, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing. Such a walkway would have to be under the purported authority of the provincial bylaws, which they did not really apply to. 9) In this case, the defendants were the owners of the buildings and land bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, Saskatchewan, Plan 83B16092. In another case, a condo lot existed immediately beside another one which was behind another one. The condo lot at Echo Bay was the subject of a conservation easement. The owner of the cottage lot complained to the municipality in 1989 that his property was being used for deck construction. When the municipality did issue a stop work order, he refused to vacate the property. The plaintiff appealed. The defendant's","THE ISSUE 1) The Defendants are charged with permitting a private building or facility, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of Sec. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983, and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. 3) They say the bylaws of the Resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded “equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination …” under Sec. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It may be that a municipality might seek to even further restrict permitted uses on the strength of its rights as a land owner, but I do not see how it could have jurisdiction to allow uses not permitted by Sec. 197. 98) Council also took the view that prosecution in respect of boathouses instead of other apparent violators, such as shed owners, was appropriate because it was boathouses that had resulted in the complaint, and they were a very private use, analogous to sheds, whereas with respect to other uses, such as walkways, docks, firepits, etc., it could be argued did not violate Sec. 197, as they could at least be utilized by the public at large. 108) The defendants see the selection of themselves as the only ones to be prosecuted out of such a large number of apparent violators, for no reason that they believe could be viewed as sufficient, as, in itself, unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of Sec. 15 of the Charter. Applications made by the defendants to the Department of Parks for permission to build things on the foreshore, which were based on misleading diagrams, are not material to the public reserve. 141) The case turns, as they themselves say, on the question of whether it is an abuse of the legal process to prosecute them when so many other apparent violators have not been charged, or a case of violating their rights under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 159) Secondly, a restrictive interpretation does not give the defendants a defence to the charge in any event, as their boathouses are not open for use by the general public. 160) In short, they have constructed a private facility on a public reserve. That is not a permitted use under Sec. 197, even interpreting it as Mr. Nanson does, and, accordingly, their boathouses are illegal under Sec. 221(1)(a)(ii). I find that council proceeded against the defendants it chose because it seemed sensible to them to do so, not because of any mala fides. 202) If I am wrong in concluding that the delay did not prejudice the defendants, the delay which I find to be unsatisfactorily explained was by that of the Department of Municipal Affairs, not the council.

However, in my view, there were no unreasonable post charge delays in this case, given its complexity. 208) Thus, in my view, there is no reason to stay these proceedings on the grounds that they constitute an abuse of the legal process, least of all when the defendants, along with other apparent violators, deliberately took their chances on being prosecuted. 214) I know of no decision that says that it is discrimination, contrary to Sec. 15, to pick out individuals to prosecute as a test case to ascertain the state of the law, where there is no evidence that it has been done on the basis of improper consideration such as personal characteristics. In my view, there has been no showing of the type of discrimination prohibited by Sec. 15. 222) Picking out boathouse builders rather than shed builders is not an example of discrimination of the type prohibited by Sec. 15, as I understand it and the case law. 223) Thus, in my view, Sec. 15 has not been violated and no stay of the proceedings should be granted on the view that it has been. 226) Thus, in my view, the proceedings should not be stayed, because there has been no violation of Sec. 15 and, if I am wrong in that regard, because, in any event, it is not “appropriate and just” that such a remedy be granted in the circumstances present here.",0.45808124459809857,"The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve land contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 1) The defendants had been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 2) Although the defendants' activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as it was an abuse and violation of the rights of the people involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 3) The only regulation made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: “A public reserve or municipal reserve may be used for any purpose that would facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area.” 4) The actual wording of the charges to so describe them was that: 1) Prior to the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the Municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. The municipality did not seek permission from anyone. Rather, it took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. The civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves were not directly in issue. The Municipality stepped into that position. 5) The municipality was responsible for maintenance on public reserves, not policing Sec. 197 and, in some cases, for the development of boathouses and other constructions. In the event of widespread violations, great expense and controversy was predictable. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce.",0.2691790040376851

5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. During the search, the accused covered her breasts and vagina, in whole or part, and that her son did not touch her on those areas but did so elsewhere. There was also a misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures searched for that suggested an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief and was potentially confusing for justice weighing the information. The cumulative effect of these errors was that the accused could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to search a nullity, and the search unlawful. The search of the computer immediately without further authorization and/or without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of a warrant render the search illegal.","c. Was the search of the computer conducted immediately on the premises legal, either because of the rules established in R. v.

The above conclusion therefore renders the Warrant to Search a nullity, and the search unlawful. The foregoing does not appear to have been done with deliberate bad faith, but shows poor investigation and negligence in not presenting fully information to the justice, and a low standard in the execution of the warrant. In the present case, it was not only a computer that was unlawfully searched, but the entire home of the Accused that was unlawfully searched. She was excited and confrontational, and as a result was arrested and removed from her house, and told that she would be charged with obstruction, a charge that is not before the Court.

Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans.

The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons.

The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the two young people and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor.

The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded.

The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated or punitive damages. However, special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories.

The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.

SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of policy of insurance with the defendants. The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of this claim. HELD: The application for punitive damages was dismissed. 1)The court found that a breach of the contract of insurance between the insurer and the plaintiffs would create a conflict of interest which would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation which would not advance the law or the public interest. 2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. 3)The Court found that there was no duty to third party by an insurance company to deal with claims arising under one of the policies after their issuance.","[4] SMI brought an application pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the former Queen’s Bench Rules to have the claim against it struck in its entirety. 7.1 From on or about May 18, 2011, continuing until the present, the second defendant and third defendants conspired and combined amongst themselves to defraud and to injure the plaintiffs in order to delay or defeat the plaintiffs’ obvious and substantial crop loss because of chemical spray drift. b) On November 30, 2012, the second defendant SMI caused to be disclosed to the plaintiffs two binders of documents thereby admitting relevancy and admissibility of those documents and waiving privilege, if any, in relation to those documents; [6] SMI has argued that Rule 7-9(3) includes implicitly the ability to file documentation referred to in the claim (McCreight v.

The defendants were equal partners in the company and the relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, on the application of Morrison, Dun-Rite was ordered liquidated.

The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'.

There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code.

Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to indeterminate detention.

The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long-term offender.

An application to have an offender declared dangerous offender can succeed without the sentencing judge being placed in a position to properly discharge these responsibilities.

The following three issues were reviewed: 1) the Court reviewed the history of the accused's offences. It found that most of the offences were the first offences committed, but that the predicate offence was the most serious and involved violence. The accused had three previous convictions, all of which related to domestic violence; 2) an assault on his sister; and 3) other incidents of violent behaviour by the accused that occurred in the context of his daily living activities. The most serious of these offences involved stabbing his sister and he had stomped on the victim's head, stomach and groin area and kicked her when he was lying on the floor gravely injured; 3) various expert witnesses testified concerning the accused’s behaviour in relation to the predicate and predicate offences. In addition to receiving evidence concerning the expert witnesses, the Court considered whether there had been a reasonable prospect of change in the course of the offender”s life, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender and appreciated that the essential question to be considered was whether the risk to re-offend was reasonably open to eventual control.","[1] The Crown has applied pursuant to section 753 of the Criminal Code to have Mr. [F.R.] designated a dangerous offender.

2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue.

The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.

The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children.

HELD: 1)The father's income from 1995 to the current date is determined to be $27,600. The mother has set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claim for gas and repairs is significantly higher than in previous years and no explanation is offered. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the step child's pet should properly be excluded. 2)The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for this year.  3)There is no evidence why the child attends high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense.

1. determination of income for the father, a
farmer who has also been employed at the
Esterhazy potash mine on a full-time basis
since May of 1997; and

2. whether the expenses of the eldest child

2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the Charter was infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel.  2) The evidence was excluded because the accused had not matched the VIN number on the dash and registration on the door to the door. 3) There was no evidence to suggest that the accused was carrying contraband.  4) The search of the motor home was done without warrant. Warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable and contrary to the Charter. It is for the Crown to establish, on balance of probabilities, that the search was lawful and that the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.","[1] The accused is charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine and marihuana found concealed in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, (the “Charter”) were violated. THE FACTS [2] On the afternoon of June 13, 2007, the accused was driving a motor home on the TransCanada highway near Caronport, Saskatchewan when he was stopped by RCMP Cst. Ian Warner. ISSUES [51] The accused submits that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed. It also satisfies me that neither Cst. Wilson nor any of the other police officers had reasonable suspicion that the motor home being driven by the accused was stolen much less that it was carrying drugs. All of this supports an inference that the detention and arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property was a pretext to justify a search of the vehicle for illegal drugs. In conducting that search police officers were acting on no more than a hunch based on intuition. [69] I find that the search of the motor home incidental to the accused’s arrest for possession of stolen property was an intrusion into his right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure.
 [80] I have already found that Cst. Wilson, who made the decision to arrest the accused, did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home was stolen. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. [82] I have earlier determined that the observations made by the police officers which caused them to reasonably suspect the accused was hauling contraband in his motor home were a product of their search incidental to his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. Thus, he was not given an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. Thus, although the accused’s s. 10(b) right was breached, there was no causal connection between the breach and the discovery of the drugs. [92] Here, the initial stop of the motor home was justified, but the ensuing s. 8 and s. 9 breaches (i.e. the search of the motor home incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property), were very serious. [93] While I do not believe Cst. Wilson intended to breach the Charter from the outset, I find that his actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. [99] I conclude that the deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the unconstitutional detention and arrest of the accused and consequent search was therefore a significant, but not egregious, intrusion on his Charter protected interests. [110] Accordingly, I find that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and that the standards is paramount. For that reason, I find the evidence seized from the motor home on June 13, 2007 must be excluded.",0.4340659340659341,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query.

The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The Court found that the children were not in need of protection under s. 11 of the Act and ordered that the Minister return the children to the mother's care until 18 years of age. The Court ordered that a short term supervisory order be made for the children until the age of 18 years, returning them to the Mother's care under supervision and conditions.  1)The mother was the mother of three children, all of whom were in the child's care. The father had been apprehended in March 2006 and was residing with the mother. The children were placed in the mother’s care until they turned 18. 2)The court found that although most foster care arrangements end when child is 18, she can stay with a foster family until that child turns 18. The court ordered that all of the children be returned to their mother. 3)The Court found there was no evidence that the mother had breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children.","The Minister seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2 (the “Act”), placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turns the age of 18 years. THE ISSUES [2] The questions I must answer are as follows:

1. Are the children, Katie, Hannah and Bobby, or any of them, children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act?

2. If so, what is the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act? 1. The children, [Katie] and [Hannah], shall remain in the care of the Minister of Social Services, and in their current foster home; 3. The mother [S.D.], will continue to have supervised access with all three children. 5. In the event any of the above becomes unworkable, prior to my final decision being rendered, leave is granted to return this matter to me by telephone conference call. 40: [40] ... First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37. I find that the Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result of the failure of S.T. and the mother to comply with the PSA. [134] If I am wrong in my determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable in the matter before me, I find that all three children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. [139] I must determine whether there has been sufficient change since March, 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother’s care. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, I find that Katie, Hannah and Bobby continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. However, I also have evidence that the children are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. [146] In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. [151] I have reached the conclusion that an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years, is the appropriate order in this case.

I am making an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. However, assuming it is in the best interests of the children, the Minister shall proceed to some unsupervised access at an appropriate time in the future.",0.41475826972010177,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned the age of 18 years.

The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including two experts and one mother to testify on the relevant factual matters. It is not disputed that S.T. breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children, but the mother was not happy to have the Ministry involved and never has been. The father of one child, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, indicated he was unable to attend trial because he was ill. The other child who had been apprehended with severe lice, J.W., did not appear at trial. 3) The mother had three children, all of whom were in the care of the Minister prior to the mother's arrest. The Minister had the mother placed on apprehended status. She was ordered to have regular weekly access for the children for three times per week for a minimum of four hours. The child was to have lunch with the mother and listen to music and dance with her. 4) If the children were found to have Goldenhar Syndrome, the mother would be returned to the Minister for custody of the other child. 5) The evidence in this matter focused on the mother’s change from being hostile to the father during the arrest and detention of the children and her changing attitude towards the mother. The court reviewed the various specialists’ reports and found that the mother had changed. She would no longer put the interests of man before her children.","The Minister seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c.

HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I.

The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to place the child in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, V.M., who is a convicted child abuser, has been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction for child abuse. He has been in contact with the child since apprehension, but there was an indication baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and not ready for it. The maternal grandmother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she were granted custody. HELD: The child was placed with the permanent custody of R.S. (the maternal grandmother) and R.M.'s (the paternal grandmother) plan of care, which was reviewed by the court, was made the sole recommendation that the child be placed with a maternal grandmother who would provide supervised access to both parents on a frequent and regular basis. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent their own child without there being sufficient risks to their healthy development. This is only one factor that must be balanced and considered in determining what is in the best interest of the individual children respectively.","[6] The father, V.M., is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine (39) months in prison as a result of the conviction. [47] Considering all the evidence before the court, including the two plans of care, there is a bond between the paternal grandmother and the child. [48] It is in the best interest of the child, D., that this matter be dismissed and by separate order, the court will grant leave to the paternal grandmother to apply for custody. An order will issue under that Act (Maintenance and Custody Act) granting custody to the paternal grandmother who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.",0.46774193548387094,"This was a disposition hearing under s. 41(1) of the Children and Family Services Act respecting the relationship between the parties. The father was a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of the conviction. His access to his son was by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of his son in an unsupervised situation. HELD: The court granted leave to the paternal grandmother to apply for custody. An order will issue under that Act (Maintenance and Custody Act) granting custody to the maternal grandmother who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed.

As of the date of this appeal, no part of those funds had been returned. The appellant appealed.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 each to the defendants, with an additional $1,000.00 to Christos. The front of three cheques were filed as exhibits with the Court. There is no issue that the defendants received the money for expenses related to the plaintiff bringing her to Canada. HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment for Lilia. The amount of damages as to this aspect of the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. 2) Lilia claims back $2,400.00 which was paid to the defendant in the amount of $500 per month and then 7 days later the first payment would be taken out. There was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which would have affected the fact that once she was dismissed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had an obligation to record accurate working hours in the record of her employment and housing. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply a gift to assist the defendants to start their new life in Canada. The plaintiff as well could have received a verbal loan with the defendants. 3) The defendant Lilias claims for wages for December 2011. She has claimed that she worked eight days and never received the cheque for her hours or vacation pay. She also claims that she was awarded $960.00 being deductions from her December cheque. 4) As there was no evidence to support the claim that Lilia received the $3,500.00 cheque, there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque and there if no evidence was put forward by Lilia that supports that claim. The balance of probabilities are not satisfied. 5) The court found that there were no costs awarded to Lilia as a result of her failure to obtain the payments that she had lost.  6) The Court was not satisfied that there was a loan of $1 million. The defendant was entitled to the sum of $12,000 from Lilia for expenses incurred by her to have him come into Canada.  7) There is nothing to indicate that matters were not amiable between the defendants and the plaintiff.  8) The defendants have not put forth any information to support this allegation. The counterclaim as to the $500 is not proven.","[7] I find that there is actually no loan given to Christos as far as the $1,000.00 is concerned.

The defendants are new to Canada and to large extent reliant upon John and his family for their employment and housing, it would not be out of the ordinary for the plaintiff to provide them with a gift to start their new life in Canada. Although the cheques come from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. The plaintiff states that he gave the money to the defendant as a gift. The defendant testified that they sent out a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. There is no record of what happened between the defendant and the plaintiff except for the fact that the defendant signed the cheque and gave it back. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she can now obtain the payments that she lost. If she is not able to obtain these payments, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff Lilia.  2) Lilia's counterclaim is not proven on a balance of probabilities. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the loan was agreed to by Lilia as she was a corporation. It would be simple for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to them. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply gift to assist the defendants with their start in Canada journey.  3) The payback of the loan as set out in the statement of claim at $500 per month was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. It is also unclear as to why the amount of $400.00 was taken, when he stated the agreement was to be $500. This does not affect how Lilia testified that she had worked more than 600 hours, which she had in mind, in order to obtain maternity leave. 4) There were several inconsistencies in the testimony of Lilia, including her testimony that she gave the defendant $2,000 cash","[7] I find that there is actually no loan given to Christos as far as the $1,000.00 is concerned.

[23] I find that the plaintiff has not proven on the balance of probabilities that the $5,000.00 to her was a loan, and find that it was a gift. [24] Accordingly the plaintiff’s claims are hereby dismissed. [28] The counterclaim as to the $2,400.00 is not proven. As with her husband Christos, I find this was agreed to by Lilia and there if no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by the defendant Lilia. [47] As the amount of damages is not known at this time, and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, in light of the Court’s finding that she has worked 604 hours, the issue of damages as to this aspect of the defendant Lilia’s claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.",0.5467224546722455,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants are new to Canada and to large extent reliant upon John and his family for their employment and housing, it would not be out of the ordinary for the plaintiff to provide them with a gift to start their new life in Canada. Although the cheques come from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. The plaintiff states that he gave the money to the defendant as a gift. The defendant testified that they sent out a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. There is no record of what happened between the defendant and the plaintiff except for the fact that the defendant signed the cheque and gave it back. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she can now obtain the payments that she lost. If she is not able to obtain these payments, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff Lilia.  2) Lilia's counterclaim is not proven on a balance of probabilities. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the loan was agreed to by Lilia as she was a corporation. It would be simple for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to them. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply gift to assist the defendants with their start in Canada journey.  3) The payback of the loan as set out in the statement of claim at $500 per month was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. It is also unclear as to why the amount of $400.00 was taken, when he stated the agreement was to be $500. This does not affect how Lilia testified that she had worked more than 600 hours, which she had in mind, in order to obtain maternity leave. 4) There were several inconsistencies in the testimony of Lilia, including her testimony that she gave the defendant $2,000 cash","[7] I find that there is actually no loan given to Christos as far as the $1,000.00 is concerned.

HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a).

The onus will be on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship. The evidence in this case does not support finding of intentional unemployment.

The court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges. The Crown was given an opportunity, which it took, to file a written argument on the issue. The trial was eventually scheduled to take place in February 2009. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. He was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held.",0.5432835820895523

The Province had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The hospital was never at risk for fire loss and the named insured was Delta with loss, if any, payable to the Province. Hartford sought contribution from Delta's insurer, Guardian. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid some $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta. The respondent sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the Guardian policy provided that the building was never required to carry builder's risk insurance. The learned trial judge found the building never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian wasn't liable. Hartford ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. Guardian had no obligation to Delta to pay the fire as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was never the risk for the fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the province or Fraser- Brace for causing it fire. 2)The appellant had no contractual relationship with Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire losses suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. 3)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence and no evidence of the fire causing the fire and the obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province for the Fire loss.

The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself.

The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question.

The issue to be decided is whether the conduct of the authorities, considered on an objective basis effectively and unfairly deprived the accused of the right to make this choice.

HELD: 1) The accused was not detained. He was not asked to open the back of the van. The search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. of the Charter.  2) The Court found that the accused did not require a warrant as he did not have any reasonable or probable grounds to believe that the marijuana plants were in the vehicle. 3) The evidence was not relevant to determining whether the accused required any assistance. There were no exigent circumstances upon which the search could have been conducted. 4) Counsel was satisfied the accused was fishing to see what answer he got. The question had nothing to do with determining whether he required assistance. The conversation was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case against the accused. The right to silence as protected by s. 7 is a fundamental right protected by the fundamental right of fundamental justice. It is said the Court recognized that the random stop of motor vehicle amounts to an arbitrary detention and that there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Court held the accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his pants, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter: 1. Was there an arbitrary detentions contrary to the Charter; 2. Was the search unreasonable contrary to s.(e) the Charter? The Court was satisfied that the officer was conducting an objective search of the vehicle and did not see any evidence of an offence. The issue to be decided was whether the arrest and detention","[1] The accused, Lorry Richard Smith (""Smith""), is charged: [2] A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marihuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. As a warrantless search the onus is on the Crown. The Crown has not established that the search was authorized by law. The accused\'s right under s. 8 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was violated. [74] In the circumstances I am satisfied the evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began with Cst. McLaughlin asking the accused what was in the back of the van. As a result, admission of the marihuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the Crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.",0.3778501628664495,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in a narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana in a vehicle. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates stop on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth.

The accused testified that he did not know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants when she told the officer that she said 'no'. Further examination of all the evidence is necessary.  1) The Court was the trier of fact and law so am obliged to decide the facts in this case by applying the same principles that a jury would be required to apply. 2) The accused had not consumed alcohol until he drank vodka in the trailer that evening but his recollection of what happened was detailed and his evidence was not shaken in cross examination. 3) The complainant's testimony was entirely consistent with that of other witnesses. There was no suggestion that she was motivated by revenge or anything of the sort that was raised in the context of the statements made by the accused and the witnesses. The court found that although the complainant may not have believed the accused's version of events, she had not been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by his evidence in a courtroom setting. Further examination is necessary to determine how the instructions are to be considered.",I believe the testimony of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1. The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that J.T. forced himself upon K.S. and committed a sexual assault upon her at a time when she was under the age of 16 years contrary to section 271(1) of the Code.,0.19811320754716982,"The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s.271(1) of the Criminal Code and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body, to wit his penis. The Crown elected to proceed by way of indictment on both charges and the accused elected trial by this Court. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the accused had not consumed alcohol until the evening of the alleged offence and that his recollection of what happened was detailed and his evidence was not shaken in cross examination. The evidence of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was not consistent with the other evidence provided at trial nor were they consistent with his earlier testimony in Court.",0.21951219512195125
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

[3] The appellants raised a number of grounds for the appeal which may be summarized as follows: There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge\'s finding that returns were not filed; That there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants\' right to a fair trial; That the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister\'s behalf.

That is because, had he known the full contents of the original check sheet, he would have known that such a question would have inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in this case. In the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this trial, I am satisfied that Mr. Charron suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence. As a result, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his rights under s. 7 were infringed. [11] This is not a case where I find bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on the part of either Cst. Granrude or Mr. Stricker. That said, I am further satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst. Pshyk’s re-direct testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence (Exhibit P-2) without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. The lack of full disclosure on what was a critical point in this case, and the time at which this failure was discovered, rendered this trial to be unfair in a way that I am not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and a disclosure order. [13] I order, pursuant to s. 24(1), that the Operational Checksheets (Exhibits P-2, P-3, D1 and D2) and any reference to Exhibit P-2 in the re-direct examination of Cst. Psych be excluded from evidence at this trial.",0.5041459369817578,"The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and 24(2) of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that Mr. Moore be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure. HELD: The accused's rights were infringed. 1)The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechleets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown prosecutor.

9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appealed the Chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in principle, disregard material matter of fact, or fail to act judicially. The Court must still decide whether fairness is better achieved by applying issue estoppel or by refusing to apply it. 2) The appellant did not seek to overturn factual determinations made by the Hearing Officer, supplement those facts with new evidence, and ask a different decision maker to reach a different conclusion. 3) The jurisdiction to hear the appeal was not dependent on his argument respecting any attenuated right under SCAN to make interlocutory applications in the court below.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed [3] For the reasons hereinafter set forth, Mr. Newell’s appeal is dismissed.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his wife. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. The respondent left but returned about 4:00 p.m. and was in possession of a quart of whiskey. He left shortly thereafter taking the whiskey with him. At approximately 2:00 a.m., he returned to the wife's residence.

The distinction between specific and general intent offences has been preserved. In general intent the Crown need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent to perform the act of the assault.

The threshold condition of material change in circumstance satisfied, the court should consider the matter afresh without defaulting to the existing arrangement. 2) Given the state of the evidence, it was open to the judge to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the child. She observed that given their ages and maturity levels, their wishes would not normally be taken into account in a structuring parenting arrangement.

The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. [28] We can find no error in the approach taken by the Chambers judge to her analysis of the best interests of the children. Conclusion [29] There is no material error, or misapprehension of the evidence, or error of law by the Chambers judge in proceeding on the evidence she had before her and in her determination of the children’s best interests and her crafting of a suitable order. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.",0.5196850393700788,"The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence has been met. 3) There was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The matter was remitted to Queen's Bench for determination.",0.5195402298850574

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor who was working with the accused at the time of the accident. HELD: The Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood was either taken personally by the accused or was taken by a technician under his supervision. The Court accepted the evidence of the doctor that the samples were taken from the accused while at the Victoria Hospital, Prince Albert. The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand, based on the doctor's opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. The officer testified that he relied on police officers and trusted them. The accused's memory of events was significantly affected by his alcohol consumption on the night in question but he went on to say that he could not be 100% sure that he had taken the blood himself.","24. A number of issues were raised in submissions of counsel at trial:
(1) whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand?


(2) whether the demand met the requirements of (I) the sample being taken by a medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner; (II) whether the officer had actually obtained information from the physician so that he could be confident and advise the accused that the taking of the blood sample would not endanger the life of the accused?
3. whether the accused gave a valid consent?
4. whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable?
5. whether the Crown can rely on the Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner (P-5) where on the evidence as a whole there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician in the taking of the sample? 25. I have found that the officer had the following grounds when he made the demand: (1) the accused was in the driver\'s compartment of the vehicle; (2) odour of alcohol from the vehicle and subsequently confirmed to be coming from the accused\'s breath; (3) open 1/16 full OV bottle of beer in the vehicle; and (4) the nature of the accident. upon this review of the case law, I conclude that the facts that were in the mind of the officer at the time he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. As set out in my findings of fact, I am satisfied that, although the Crown has not proved whether the doctor or a technician actually took the blood sample, there is no other logical conclusion on the facts than that either the doctor took the samples himself or the technician took them under the supervision of the doctor. I am satisfied that the doctor would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life or health of his patient. I conclude that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all of the matters that could have been proved by the certificate, P-5, if it could have been relied upon. 36. Having found that the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of the accused\'s blood pursuant to the requirements of Sections 254 and 258 of the Criminal Code, the accused\'s consent was not required. Given the condition of the accused and his need for care and, given the limitations on the opportunities to the officer to observe the accused to determine if he had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand, there is no question in my mind that the officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any unnecessary delay.

The Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. Based on the officer's testimony that he asked the permission of the doctor to take the blood, and his evidence that he did not recall signing the second certificate, and on the evidence of other witnesses who testified that they had seen the accused in the hospital, the Court found that the officer had no reason whatsoever to taint his evidence by favouring either the Crown or the accused and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Crown had proved that the Blood was actually taken by the accused or his friends. On the evidence as a whole, the Crown was left with reasonable doubt as to who actually took the blood.",0.5425101214574899

The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.

While the issue of delay may be vexing to some, the Court found that the chambers judge in chambers was required to determine the merits of the appeal in light of the wording of the Rules.","Disposition: Leave to Appeal Granted (Orally) The proposed respondent did not provide security, as she was entitled to do by Rule 409A, and the sheriff therefore seized two of the disputed dogs then in her possession. She then applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her, on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. [2] The chambers judge granted the application, finding, on the basis of affidavit evidence filed before him, that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would therefore constitute an abuse of the process of the Court. [4] The question raised on the proposed appeal is whether the chambers judged erred in enquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellants’ affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of subrule (1). In light of the clear wording of Rule 407(2), the question is clearly not frivolous or vexatious. Most significantly, it is my view that the ruling of the chambers judge in this case raises an issue of considerable significance to the general operation of the remedy of a writ of replevin as provided in the Rules of Court, and merits consideration by this Court.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.

5_2003skqb115.txt,"Creditor and Debtor - Conversion - Punitive Damages FIAT. A motion for summary judgment under Queen's Bench Rule 485 governing simplified procedure. The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. Costs in the cause. Whether the plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation could not be resolved in the absence of cross-examination.","FIAT: This is a motion for summary judgment under Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court governing simplified procedure. The plaintiff says his creditor wrongfully converted monies after full and final settlement of his account was agreed upon. In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant's 'high-handed and malicious behavior'. HELD: The motion is dismissed. A summary trial is ordered. Costs will remain in the cause. 1)The defendant was relying on misrepresentation as the ground for vitiating the settlement agreement rather than mutual mistake. The test set out in Caudle v. Louisville Sales Service Inc. et al. (1999), 1999 SKQB 276 (CanLII), 190 Sask. R. 73 (Q.B.) does not assist the plaintiff. In that case, Laing J. said at para. 4:...the test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. 2)The plaintiff owed the defendant monies for chemicals and fertilizer. In May, 2001 the plaintiff assigned to the defendant his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application on his outstanding account. Subsequent to this, the parties agreed to settle the debt for a lesser sum. The defendant says it was induced to settle by the plaintiff's false representation that: 1. Saskatchewan Government Insurance was suing him for between $250,000 and $300,000; 2. That the plaintiff would be found liable; and 3. That plaintiff would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy rendering the defendant’s account uncollectible.  4)SGI had no money and with the impending action by SGI against him for the recovery of damages due to his unlicensed vehicle being involved in a fatal accident, he was definitely being sued. SGI advised the plaintiff he would be personally responsible for all damages as the owner of an uninsured vehicle if there was no law suit.

Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.

The Informations in Support, each essentially identical, have been sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications before the Court are for DNA warrant application with respect to the baby, at least until DNA analysis was carried out on blood or other bodily substances of the alleged father and the alleged mother. The baby is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided by the informant. The basis on which the officer has learned this, and from whom, is not stated. The maiden name of the 19 year old woman, as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is different than the surname of the natural mother. There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest. While it is literally true that the natural Mother's blood sample has been obtained from 'within' her body, it is my view that it cannot reasonably be argued that this blood sample is 'associated with' the commission of an offence. While there are numerous definitions of the words “associate” and “associated with”, there is no indication as to the source of the blood sample, which is based on a two-month relationship at the time the child was allegedly conceived. There was nothing from the biological mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this child. Such statement should ordinarily be included; this is especially the case when the relationship is shortlived. While the Informations attach copy of the Registration of live Birth obtained by the RCMP from Vital Statistics regarding the month old baby, there was no similar registration of live birth respecting his 19 year-old mother, notwithstanding that it appears she was born in Saskatchewan and the document should be as readily available as was that of the baby.

In any event, there is no disputing the applicant's claim that he was invited to speak at the symposium, but the reasons as a whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.  1) Before passing upon the merits of the application it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the Board of Governors. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union (2004 SCC 23) the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it is clear the Standard of Review to be apply in this case is one of reasonability. 2) In this case the applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. 3) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the applicant was acting in his capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 4) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board have interfered with the academic liberty of this faculty member, in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005).

The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement.

(“Patchrite”) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to Sweeprite Mfg. Inc. (“Sweeprite”). The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (the “PPSA”). That issue requires a determination on whether the Lease was a “lease for a term of more than one year” as defined in s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.... [29] The business of leasing which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was, from May to December of 2001, the only business of Patchrite and thereafter continued to be a significant part of Patchrite’s business. [30] In these facts and circumstances, I find and conclude that Patchrite was “regularly engaged in the business of leasing” within the meaning of subsection 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The lease in question was therefore “a lease for a term of more than one year” within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration.

The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour.

It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Committee's decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty.","[1] Pat Pottie, a licensed realtor, appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee (“Committee”) of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission (“Commission”), and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. [14] In a written decision filed on May 6, 2004, the Committee imposed sanctions. It is the Hearing Panel\'s unanimous decision that the following sanctions be implemented: 1. Mr. Pottie\'s license to trade in real estate be suspended for a period of two years effective immediately. [42] In Future Inns Canada Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Labour Relations Board), (1997) 1997 CanLII 9861 (NS CA), 160 N.S.R.(2d) 241, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held, at paragraphs 76 and 77, that since judicial review for jurisdictional error was a constitutionally guaranteed right, it was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions. [48] While adequacy depends upon the context and there may be no precise single test of adequacy, reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors. [54] Having stated that the standard of review on matters of law is correctness, this Court finds that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. CONCLUSION [67] Applying the standard of review of reasonableness to the Committee’s findings of unprofessional conduct, the court dismisses the appeal. [68] Applying the standard of review of correctness to the Committee’s failure to explain its reasons for the sanctions (including costs), the court grants the appeal, and remits the issue of sanctions back to the Committee with a direction that it reconsider its decision.",0.4314606741573034,"The appellant appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The appellant's first ground is that it appears to have taken a very short time for the Committee to reach decision that the appellant was guilty of five acts of professional misconduct. The Committee recessed for twenty minutes after full day hearing, before returning with decision. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court finds that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, the absence of any explanation for the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The penalty of the board is excessive. The Court adopts the third ground of appeal. The Commission is self-governing body with power to make rules and enforce them because it is in better position to do so. The decision of the Committee was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented.",0.44

As such, they are irrelevant to the plaintiff's action in defamation. 4) The pleadings do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 5) The paragraphs contain references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club which would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff is referring to them. 6) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision to the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 7) Ibid.","[1] On April 4, 2014 the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., Leonard Banga and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga. The plaintiffs brought three causes of action and claimed damages over and above what might be referred to as normal damages. The defendants were alleged to have induced the plaintiff to abandon his previous employment and sought damages for actions that amounted to defamation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were using the contents of this statement of claim in an attempt to prove their allegation that the defendant had defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. The applicants sought the following relief: 1) Rule 13-8 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for the striking of portions of the paragraphs that appear to be plead facts. 2) Rule 7-9 is similar to former Rule 139(1) of the former Rule 173 which provides in part that a pleading or other document is to be struck. These facts are material to the plaintiffs' case as they are necessary to adequately define the nature of the action and to any moral damages flowing from it. 3) The defendants plead facts which, if proven, would establish they were fully aware that the plaintiffs were in no way responsible for any acts of intimidation and harassment and that they dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. As such, they are irrelevant to the plaintiff's action in defamation. 4) The pleadings do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 5) The paragraphs contain references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club which would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff is referring to them. 6) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision to the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 7) Ibid.","[1] On April 4, 2014 the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., Leonard Banga and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. [2] The first claim, wrongful dismissal, is advanced by the plaintiffs against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga. The second cause of action is a claim for defamation brought against the defendant Leonard Banga, and the third cause of action, inducing breach of contract, is brought against the defendant Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. 1.

The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he injected it with paint from sprayer rented from the defendant. The defendant was liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the defendant's negligence in failing to warn of the danger in using an airless paint sprayer. The plaintiff had rented the sprayer from a shop owner who was an independent contractor for whose negligence the defendant was not vicariously liable. Although the plaintiff had a partial loss of an index finger, he was unable to function at his job for about three months after the amputation, although he apparently went to work. He needed an extra man because of the missing index finger. The plaintiffs claim loss of income, past and future and that an ordinary user would not appreciate the disastrous consequences of placing finger in front of sprayer nozzle. This is especially so here where the non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated and the defendant cannot delegate the duty of care owed to the plaintiff.","defendant.

failure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an
airless paint sprayer. Furthermore, I conclude that an ordinary user

facts, I conclude the waiver is ineffective (see Crocker). Taking all of these factors into account, I assess
the plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss of

9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.

His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.

capital cost allowance on personal property is a reasonable
expense. In that regard I am going to impute 15% of the
capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the
respondent pursuant to s. 19 in each of the above years. I find that the respondent's income for 1994 for the
purposes of the guidelines is $36,517.38; for 1995 it is
(-$31,322.97) and for 1996 it is $91,535.75. I decline to include the
1997 income information in this calculation, despite the fact
that the guidelines require the court to use the most recent
information. I do this because the financial evidence filed
by the respondent with respect to 1997 was not sufficient nor
substantiated sufficiently to determine income. The respondent shall pay to the applicant commencing
January 1, 1998, and continuing on the first day of each month
thereafter the sum of $454.00 for the support of the two
children of the marriage, such support to continue for so long

A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

Rather, it was the youth's recollection of the conversation with the officer that led him to conclude that the officers had conducted a 'pat-down' search. The youth was not aware that the presence of drugs in the vehicle associated with the trafficking of cocaine, nor did he have any prior knowledge of the location of the drugs.

The search was motivated by a degree of urgency and in a way that ensured the loss of drugs, prevented their destruction, and prevented their dissemination in the jail setting or at the courthouse. The evidence heard on the voir-dire did not rest on the presumption that the evidence should be excluded from the evidence. Rather, it was the youth's recollection of the conversation with the officer that led him to conclude that the officers had conducted a 'pat-down' search. The youth was not aware that the presence of drugs in the vehicle associated with the trafficking of cocaine, nor did he have any prior knowledge of the location of the drugs. The interaction between the youth and the officer was brief and meaningful. The interactions between the officer and the accused were brief and respectful.","[1] R.C., a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA), is charged, on or about the 23rd of April, 2007, with having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. [2] This is a decision following a voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of R.C. by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. [13] Clearly, R. C. was lawfully under arrest for having been found in possession of the stolen vehicle. On the balance of probabilities, I find that the strip search was specifically related to the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest of R. C. and was ,therefore, incident to arrest. The strip search was lawful and there was no breach of Section 8 of the Charter. [41] In the event there was a breach of R. C.’s section 8 rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure this is not a case in which the evidence should be excluded. The Applicant has not satisfied me that the admission of the drugs located on the person of R.C. would render the trial unfair. [46] The search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. I agree however, that here, significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person. Therefore, in the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible.",0.5117565698478561,"The accused was charged with having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, crack cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

HELD: The Court found that the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. The search was conducted as quickly as possible and in a way that ensured that young persons were not completely undressed at any one time. There was concern not only about the loss of drugs but also about the potential that they could be ingested, hidden or destroyed by the accused. The evidence showed that neither officer touched the accused, that at no time was he totally undressed and that the officer removed the drugs from his underwear himself.

The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Lions Club with the assistance of the fire department. The fire department was standing by in the sense that it had a fire truck parked nearby and had some of its members in attendance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs taxed in the usual way. The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same as in the respondents' case. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

Information Y379569: Count 1- While bound by a youth probation order made by the Honourable Judge W. K. Tucker, of Saskatchewan Youth Court on the 20th day of August, 2012, did wilfully fail to comply with such order, to wit, keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and
Count 2- While bound by a youth probation order made by the Honourable Judge W. K. Tucker, of Saskatchewan Youth Court on the 20th day of August, 2012, did wilfully fail to comply with such order, to wit, not attend within the Province of Saskatchewan unless with the prior permission of the Court, contrary to s. 137 the Youth Criminal Justice Act. [2] The issue before the Court is whether Mr. L. can be sentenced to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. 3) Sophistication and size of the operation - the evidence seemed to indicate a fairly unsophisticated operation being conducted out of the back seat of a vehicle. 4) The impact on the community - cocaine has a huge impact on small northern communities. 8) Is the area of the drug trafficking activity frequented by young people - in my years of living in the Town of La Ronge, Saskatchewan, I easily conclude that Kikinaahk Friendship Centre is the most popular gathering place for older children and adolescents in the district. That being said, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. [18] To me however, the most aggravating factor that has the potential to move this offence into the exceptional case category is the fact that Mr. L. was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine on August 20, 2012. [20] Clearly, his previous sentence of probation as imposed by Judge Tucker on August 20, 2012, based on a conviction of possession for the purposes of trafficking in cocaine, has failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury had triggered the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It is essential that he know now what his future obligations will be. 2)The parties had three children. The respondent remained in the matrimonial home and supported the applicant from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by the divorce judgment. 3)The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 1995 order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated.","[1] The applicant applies to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. [2] The application before me was triggered by the applicant’s loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. [4] The applicant raises two grounds as constituting a material change in circumstances.  The applicant has met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there has been a material change in circumstances since the spousal support order was last revised. [18] It is significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that the spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. In this case, being a traditional marriage, the respondent has been disadvantaged to a greater degree than has the applicant. The respondent devoted her full time to working in the home and raising the three children of the marriage during the years when she would have been the most productive financially had she pursued a job or a career outside the home.

HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts.

The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. The parties had three children, all now adults living independently of their parents. The respondent, now retired, supported the applicant from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by a divorce judgment, at which time the support was reduced to $1,500. The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances.

The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of conspiracy to possess marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 6(2) of the Criminal Code and s. 465(1)(c), and possession of a large amount of cash and other valuables. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The investigations and the informations to obtain the search warrants were the responsibility of and the latter were sworn by the accused. The accused was the only occupant of the premises at the time of the search. HELD: The Court found that the evidence obtained by the search was sufficient, even in a warrant, to identify, to a person confronted with a warrant to search his residence, the offences in respect of which the warrant authorizes the search and that the items seized during the search were clearly stated on the face of the warrant. The Court concluded that the accused was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and in particular pages and (the latter outlining, as it was intended to do, the proposed offences in the area) was inadequate and unsatisfactory to meet the minimum offence description requirements contemplated by Form S. 24 of the Code as those requirements were further interpreted and identified to apply in the Dombrowski and Alder cases.","[6] The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search (the “Application”). The Application alleges a violation of the accused’s s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Part 1 of the Constitution Act, 1982 being Schedule B to the Canada Act, 1982, (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the “Charter”) rights. The search therefore was per se unreasonable and in violation of Mr. Smith’s s. Charter rights. In consequence the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. [26] Nevertheless, and notwithstanding this observation, the evidence satisfies me that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the Warrants.

b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences charged occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The accused was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. These offences occurred during the transition from the Juvenile Delinquents Act to the Young Offenders Act and were subject to the transition provisions of the latter Act. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The trial judge was not in the circumstances prepared to assume jurisdiction on counts two and three of the Act to determine the proper jurisdiction.,"Appeal Allowed: 30 June 1998 [1] The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences charged occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult but it is not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused person was a young person or an adult. [2] The accused was charged by information dated January 6, 1996, that being a young person within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act,[1] he committed the following offences: (1) between January 1, 1982 and January 3, 1983, he did commit acts of gross indecency against G.W., contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code;[2] (2) between January 4, 1982 and December 31, 1989, he did on more than one occasion commit a sexual assault on G.W. contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code; and, (3) between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1989, did have sexual intercourse with G.W. while knowing that G.W. was his sister and did thereby commit incest contrary to s. 155 of the Criminal Code. [6] The trial judge dismissed count number one finding that there was no evidence on which he could find the accused guilty. Issue [14] The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court judge was correct in declining jurisdiction on the basis he was unable to determine whether the alleged offences occurred when the accused was a young offender. The secondary issue of whether a writ of mandamus should issue will of necessity follow the result of the determination of the first issue. Analysis [15] The accused was charged with having committed two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, over a period of seven years commencing January 4, 1983. If the Crown, after a complete investigation, is unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred and as a result alleges that it or they occurred over a period of time which includes when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is the following: (1) the Crown should commence the proceedings in youth court, because some of the offences were alleged to have occurred when the accused was a young person; and, (2) the Crown should then apply to the youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s. 16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.

7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998. The marriage breakdown had been established and the parties had agreed on joint custody of the children with the respondent to reside primarily with his father, the respondent, and the petitioner to reside with her mother, the petitioner. The husband was ordered to keep the children on his group insurance benefit plan so long as they are eligible and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for such period as, in the case of each child, that child continues to be a child of the marriage as defined in the Divorce Act. The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the respondent. HELD: 1) The respondent will have to contribute his proportionate share of the orthodontic treatment expenses for the petitioner that is not covered by insurance with the cost of any major repairs to be split equally. 2) The value of the termination benefit as of the date of the petition is $27,333.50, one-half of which is $13,666.75. The respondent is ordered to convey 1/2 of the commuted value of $7,658 (½ of $21,804.38 = $10,902.19) to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner, subject to matrimonial property adjustment calculations. 3) The petitioner seeks adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs and with respect to minimum monthly payments on the Canada Trust Powerline loan. 4) In issue is whether division at the time of petition would lead to an unfair and inequitable result so as to require compilation at a different date, the effect of which would be unequal division.","[1] This is an action for divorce based on separation. [3] The marriage breakdown has been established. The divorce is granted. The parties will equally share the children\'s time during school vacations. The respondent\'s gross salary is $59,700 per annum and, as invited by counsel for the petitioner, I am adding $1,500 to reflect the profit the respondent makes on the car allowance he is paid by his employer, to a total of $61,200. Therefore, the appropriate monthly support payment in accordance with the Guidelines is $485 per month subject to any additions pursuant to s. 7. Evidence was presented as to certain expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities but none of these, in my view, qualifies as a special or extraordinary expense in the context of the basic monthly support payment of $485. As that compilation does not reflect the spousal maintenance hereinafter awarded, I find the appropriate ratio to be 73 percent. The petitioner\'s prospective job advancement was impeded as the result of the marriage, specifically by the frequent moves to accommodate the respondent\'s job transfers, and arising from her working out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. [26] I find the appropriate amount of spousal maintenance to be $900 per month, payable the first day of each and every month commencing as of January 1, 2001. I am, however, stipulating that the issue of spousal maintenance be reviewable at the instance of either party at any time after December 31, 2003.

At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","This was a decision in the matter of Nicolas Grady and Gallegos Grady. A divorce hearing was held in October 2009 and November 2, 2009. The parties marriage was established; the court's jurisdiction to grant divorce was established, the grounds for the divorce were established and there being no bars to the divorce, the divorce was granted. The petitioner applied to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in paragraph 9 of the separation agreement changed in as much as he sought a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Corollary Relief judgment is at variance with the parties' separation agreement. 2) There is no evidence that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. 3) The petitioner has been paying his father $3,000 per month pursuant to a buy out agreement pertaining to his interest in the business since January 2009. There may be changes in circumstances in the future. These changes (no matter how radical or unforeseen) will not have the effect of setting aside the terms of this agreement as the terms relate to division of property and to variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s17. In our view, the Act does not create an inconsistency. 4) The court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in s17(7). There is concurrence with Federal paramountcy when the Divorce Act is invoked.","Issues [4] The main issues for the court’s consideration are the spousal and child support obligations of the Petitioner, Mr. Grady and whether they are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The principal basis for the argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a shared parenting arrangement . [17] As stated, the essence of Mr. Grady\'s argument that he should not be bound by clause 9 of the separation agreement is that his income (1) has taken a dramatic and unanticipated drop; and (2) forced him to abandon the parties’ shared parenting arrangement with resulting tax consequences for him. [36] There is no suggestion herein that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. As earlier stated, he argues that (1) Mr. Grady has suffered a dramatic drop in income, and (2) he is no longer in a shared parenting arrangement. However, I can and do take judicial notice of the concerns in this regard that were the subject of much public debate in October 2008, prior to the Federal general election held in October, 2008. I agree that the economic downturn was more extreme than anticipated at the time the parties concluded the separation agreement. [62] In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the: (1) strong, unambiguous language of the agreement arrived at after extensive negotiation and a judicial settlement conference; Mr. Grady’s continuing default is not in the interest of either party.

It was pertinent to note that the respondent had filed his income tax returns from 2006; 2007; and 2008. In addition, the respondent filed a separate income tax return, which was a two-page document summarizing the business income of the petitioner for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. In it, he listed various expenses that he incurred in order to pay the respondent, who had recently become economically self-sufficient, to complete her post-secondary education, and to make all reasonable efforts to achieve that goal.

I find that in this case the accused has not suffered actual prejudice and that the conditions of release he is subject to are not so onerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to lead me to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. [19] This is a charge which involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence (see R. v. Robillard [2000] S.J. No. 345). [21] The application is therefore denied.",0.468384074941452,"Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach and the application was dismissed. HELD: The Court found that there was no actual or inferred prejudice and that the conditions of release he was subject to were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to lead me to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. Given the finding of no actual prejudice, the question remains as to whether the prejudice to the accused in the delay is such that to outweigh the prejudice that would result if the accused was not to face trial for this charge. The six-month delay is not so long as to lead to an inference of prejudice or to a potential prejudice of the accused nor does any potential prejudice caused by the delay outweigh the public interest in having the accused face trial on these charges.",0.5101214574898785

The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents.

The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents.

The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act. 1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage. 2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader. 3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act. The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo). The plaintiff claims the Spreader was 'entirely unfit for spreading compost' and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. HELD: The action is dismissed. Costs are awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff has not established to my satisfaction, on a balance of probabilities, that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in this Act.

The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow return of the Spreaders. 3) There was no written notice given to the purchaser prior to the purchase date. If the purchaser does not have written notice, the purchaser must reject the implement. Further, if the purchaser has not taken any steps to make this decision within the next seven days, the defendant will be bound by the same claim as the plaintiff.","FACTS [1] The plaintiff, Glenrose Farms (“Glenrose”), purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 (the “Spreader’), from the defendant, Apollo Distributing Corporation (“Apollo”), on December 1, 1999.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property over the past nine years. HELD: The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past 9 years. The court did not order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem.  1) The plaintiffs were awarded costs of $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property during the course.  2) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. They were also ordered to pay $6,000 to the plaintiffs for damages which were caused by golf balls flying from the adjacent golf course onto their property for 7 months of the year.  3) The plaintiff was also awarded costs for damage to their home and their vehicles.  4) The defendant was to be responsible for those damages which had arisen since they became the owners. 5) The court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute a continuing nuisance. 6) Since the problem has been ongoing for ten years and the attempts by the defendant operator to ameliorate the damage has been unsatisfactory, the plaintiffs are no longer prepared to wait and have asked the Court for relief in the form of an injunction to prevent the defendant from operating the ninth hole until the situation has been remedied in accordance with the recommendations of the expert. 7) It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of 7 months would be an interference with the use of the property.","1) This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cattell, Mack, Bosenberg and Strassburg pursuant to Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules for damages arising to them from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the property of the plaintiffs. 36) There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole of the Emerald Park Golf Course is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance. 40) It would appear to me that this clause is of little value to the defendants given that the evidence of all of the parties, including the evidence of Ben Kuzmicz, confirms the fact that when the residential area was developed and the contract was signed, no one, including the operator (Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd.), anticipated the extent of the existing problem and, accordingly, the plaintiffs Cattell and Mack could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 42) Accordingly, the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., are therefore liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation. 44) The plaintiffs, Morley Cattell and Cheryl Mack, shall also be entitled to recover from the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. and The Town of White City, jointly and severally, the sum of $18,000.00 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the past nine years. 45) In addition, for the reasons as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years. I therefore order the following:



(a) The defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and The Town of White City are hereby enjoined from allowing its members and their guests or any other users of the golf course from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole of the course so that they land anywhere on the plaintiffs’ property.",0.5725699067909454,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs' home was adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The defendants' golf course was designed and built in the late 1980s without any residential development adjacent to it; however, in 1997, the defendant entered an agreement with Parkview Homes to open up the land beside the Golf Course for residential development.

The Court was not prepared to order the specific route of action as the matter had not yet been resolved. 2) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $6,000. 3) The defendant were ordered to pay $8,000 in damages to the plaintiffs for the damage caused from the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course in the past 9 years.  4) The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed. 5) The Court refused to order an injunction to prevent the defendants from operating the 9 hole golf course until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein. 6) The court was unable to find a specific route to take because of the expert's report.","1) This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cattell, Mack, Bosenberg and Strassburg pursuant to Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules for damages arising to them from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the property of the plaintiffs. 36) There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole of the Emerald Park Golf Course is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance. 40) It would appear to me that this clause is of little value to the defendants given that the evidence of all of the parties, including the evidence of Ben Kuzmicz, confirms the fact that when the residential area was developed and the contract was signed, no one, including the operator (Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd.), anticipated the extent of the existing problem and, accordingly, the plaintiffs Cattell and Mack could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 42) Accordingly, the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., are therefore liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation. 44) The plaintiffs, Morley Cattell and Cheryl Mack, shall also be entitled to recover from the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. and The Town of White City, jointly and severally, the sum of $18,000.00 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the past nine years. 45) In addition, for the reasons as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years.

The trial judge allowed certain of the claims, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale amounting to $7,522.95, but overturned the trial judge on the claim for legal costs incurred at the first trial, which was set forth as $39,385.82. The Court of Appeal apportioned liability between the municipality and the Director of Assessment at 50% each. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees together with some other items of loss and general damages. The specific items claimed to have occurred while the plaintiffs were out of possession and did so when the plaintiffs must be held responsible. The defendants were awarded costs in accordance with Tariff A, Scale 3.","In these circumstances this item of claim must be dismissed. There is no solid evidence of injury of any kind to warrant any award of damages, therefore, this item of claim is dismissed. The claim for legal fees for the first action and appeal must, in the face of the decision in the Attorney General et al v. Maclnnes et al, supra, also be dismissed. If the legal fees were too remote and unforeseeable for the plaintiff in that action against the Municipality, then they also must be too remote and unforeseeable for the defendant in the same action,

To this point 1 have dismissed, $418,429.31 of the plaintiffs\' claim leaving claims totalling $28,929.00 to be considered. While the damages alleged may very well have been caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through the winter months, I am satisfied that such damage as claimed occurred and did so when the plaintiffs were out of possession and the defendants must be held responsible. The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs in accordance with Tariff A, Scale 3, at an amount involved rounded out to $15,000.00.",0.46851385390428213,"The Municipality sold at tax sale certain property owned by the plaintiffs to one of the defendants. Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and Maclnnes, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking declaration as to the validity of the tax sale.

An award of general damages may not lie against the defendants in any event arising out of a tax sale held to be void.

The Court is therefore satisfied that Coachlight was entitled to install the screw pump without consulting with its defaulting Joint-Operator who was also not entitled to approve the AFE for the screw pump operation.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate.

The court found that the respondent board failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the defendant corporations were obliged to answer questions related to the mode of transportation of helicopter flights and the operator of such flights. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory, it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to the overall allegation of unsafe operation. The Court found that allowing questions on whether the project was over-budget at any particular time does not mean the plaintiffs are entitled to question the details of the budget, or why money was spent in certain areas as opposed to other areas. The report of the safety officer at the main camp site was not privileged because he was requested to prepare safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident.","Background [2] The action arises out of a helicopter crash which occurred in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on October 4, 1995 which resulted in the death of three crew members and 12 passengers. [7] The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. [11] Based on the joinder of issues set out in the foregoing, the plaintiffs are entitled to question the respective officers of the defendant corporations, and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of: Answers to all of these questions are logically relevant to the choice made by one or more of the defendants because they are factors one would expect any decision maker to take into account in deciding a specific form of transportation, and are also relevant to test the credibility of answers that may be provided by the corporate officers with respect to the reasons for the choices made. The defendant corporations therefore are obliged to answer questions directed at whether insurance was obtained, and if so who arranged and paid for the same. If the defendant, KOC is in a position to determine when such survival gear was placed on board the helicopters, the question should be answered. [27] The corporate officer examined on behalf of Cameco was asked to produce records as to when airfare tickets were reserved and purchased by Mr. Vernon Kiss and Mr. Bernard Michel for a meeting which took place in London on April 12, 1995. If not, leave is granted to reapply for direction. The relevant defendants are therefore ordered to date any document for which privilege is claimed. [38] However, counsel’s request that the persons who prepared the document and received the document be named, is simply an attempt to investigate the investigation conducted by the defendants which I noted in Auchstaetter v. Froese, 1995 CanLII 5631 (SK QB), [1995] 4 W.W.R. 716 (Sask. Q.B.) is not permitted for the reasons outlined therein. [39] If a person disclosed his or her pre-accident observations to someone in the subsequent investigation which is privileged, that person’s observations are disclosable. To the extent the defendants have knowledge of persons who made observations relevant to the matters in issue, the names of such persons must be disclosed if requested after the answer provided by the defendant corporate officer discloses relevant information emanating from that person. As a result I feel I should review this Report before making a decision with respect to its privileged status. [46] The employment agreement signed by employees of KOC contained a confidentiality clause, the wording of which is not important in view of the ruling I propose to make, and the release documents signed by employees who terminated their employment with KOC also contained a clause in which the employee agreed not to disclose any proprietary information learned during the employment. In view of the fact the employee has contracted not to disclose business information, which is a broad enough category to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer, With the foregoing restriction there will be an order that information given by this employee to plaintiffs’ counsel with respect to the matters in issue does not amount to a breach of the confidentiality clause contained in the employment agreement or the release document signed by him. [48] The chronology document is privileged on the basis it represents the work product of a privileged investigation. [49] Plaintiffs’ counsel has not established the necessary criteria pursuant to Rule 222(a) of the Rules of Court to justify examining for discovery the two former employees referred to in the material. [50] The request to explore post-accident conduct and activity on the part of senior executives of one or more of the corporate defendants on examination for discovery is also dismissed. [51] Defendants’ counsel’s request pursuant to Rule 142 to obtain from the plaintiffs particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim including particulars of the sections allegedly breached, is proper. [53] With respect to the names of potential witnesses, defence counsel are entitled to a reciprocal order to that made in favour of the plaintiffs. The names of persons who have provided facts or observations prior to the accident to counsel for the plaintiffs’ relevant to the issues are to be disclosed in the same circumstances outlined with respect to the order in favour of the plaintiffs. [55] With respect to the question on whether the wife of a deceased person can be asked if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe, the question calls for a lay opinion, and the only matter the question is relevant to is the character of her late husband.",0.2316442605997932,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiff corporations brought an action against the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants claimed liability insurance for the loss of nine of the 11 crew members who died when their helicopter collided with the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff sought to have the defendants answer questions as to when airfare tickets were reserved, the cost of such tickets, and the date of their use were to be disclosed. The defendant refused to answer whether liability insurance was obtained through KOC or Cameco. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. In any event the report of the safety officer at the main camp site is not privileged because he was requested to prepare a safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident. 2)A detailed perusal of documents will suggest the possibility of these theories. The only issue is whether the predominant purpose of all such memoranda and expert reports was contemplated litigation as opposed to the prevention of another similar accident in the future. 3)A number of documents relating to the availability of alternative forms of transportation were not properly identified. The claimed privilege is too broad and prevents him from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses, which may result in him being taken by surprise at trial. Questions related to the e-mail system are properly answerable.  4)The plaintiffs were awarded leave to reapply for direction.  5)The Saskatchewan Evidence Act defines'record' as any information that is recorded or stored by means of any device, including a computer. 6)The report of Mr. Eric Rast who was safety officer was not privileged for the simple reason that until such a date is known it cannot be known whether such records are in existence during the relevant period of time. 7)The plaintiff was entitled to seek further direction on this issue.","Background [2] The action arises out of a helicopter crash which occurred in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on October 4, 1995 which resulted in the death of three crew members and 12 passengers.

[4] Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, Mrs. Walker, who claims a portion of Mr. Walker’s pension entitlement, seeks to set aside the agreement she made with Mr. Walker, which was incorporated into the Ontario court order. Her claim is based on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. [6] First of all, as agreed by the parties, there is no question that Mrs. Walker is entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia. [10] Under the provisions of s.29 of the Act Mrs. Walker is also entitled to seek to vary the terms of the separation agreement entered into between her and her husband upon the equitable grounds as set out in the Act. ..a consent order based on and intended to carry out an agreement come to between the parties, ought to be treated as an agreement which could be properly set aside on any ground on which an agreement in the terms of the order could be set aside. [16] It follows then that Mrs. Walker by virtue of the Judicature Act is entitled to the same relief the English Court of Chancery accorded to the plaintiff in Welding v. Sanderson (supra).",0.5012165450121655,"The respondent commenced an action for divorce against the respondent on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered into the agreement.

The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony.

The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff's claim stand dismissed: the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General, Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and the entire claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs under double Column V and the (sic) other below set aside. The court found that the limitation period did not run from the expiration of the stay and that the application should not be allowed because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act.","In the one the defendants, the Government of Saskatchewan, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer, seek an order pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff\'s claim stand dismissed:

(i) the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General for Saskatchewan;

(ii) the entirely of the claim against C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and

(iii) the claim against the Government of Saskatchewan (except for that part of the claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights). [2] In the second motion the defendants, Wayne McGillivray and Michael Johnston, also seek to have the plaintiff\'s claim dismissed. Likewise, their application is grounded in Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, but they also rely on Rule 173(e). [3] The third motion is brought by the plaintiff who seeks several orders of which two were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. [4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed. That rule provides for a determination of a point of law. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. [5] As I see it, the remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be summarized as follows. (1) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim is barred by a statutory limitation period. (3) Whether a portion of the plaintiff\'s claim fails to disclose a cause of action against Quinney, Sullivan, Bauer, McGillivray and Johnston because there is no allegation of malice. (4) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan is barred by statute. The plaintiff claims general damages, special damages, punitive damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs. Accordingly the plaintiff's claim is determined to be statute-barred upon Section 51 of the Limitation of Actions Act.  The cause of action had fully accrued and the appellant had a prima facie case. To fairly determine whether that was so, there must be a hearing to determine the facts and that is best done at trial. The appeal must be allowed. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs under double Column V, and the (sic) other below is set aside. Accordingly, the application to dismiss the plaintiff's claim as being statute barred should be dismissed. The plaintiff now applies for an order granting such further time, the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. He has demonstrated a prima facie cause of action and I need say no more about that. When I consider the condition and state of the plaintiff at the relevant time, together with all of the presenting circumstances, a reasonable explanation for the delay has been put forward. [42] Most importantly, I am satisfied that no prejudice will flow to the defendants. [44] When I reflect upon the time, effort and money expended in the pursuit of this action by all parties over the past six years, I am convinced that the only reasonable course is to grant a retroactive order. Those parties seek to have the particular pleadings struck on the ground that they enjoy an immunity absent an allegation of malice or bad faith. Absent such an allegation the pleadings disclose no cause of action and should be struck as to the Crown Attorneys. I read the statutory provision as providing immunity to the Saskatchewan Police Commission and people engaged in its work. In my view, the Crown is rendered immune by the express terms of s. 5(6) of the Act from liability to the appellant. [53] As I read the Act and the decisions, I do not conclude that the Crown enjoys an absolute immunity. Therefore, this claim should be permitted to proceed along with the claim based on the Charter of Rights. No advance notice, so far as I know, was given to the other parties. Absent such notice, I am not prepared to entertain the request. (1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed; (2) that the application by the defendants, McGillivray and Johnston, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is dismissed; (3) that the application by the defendants, Quinney, Sullivan and Bauer, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is allowed and paragraphs 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 of the statement of claim are struck, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to apply to amend the pleadings; (4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights; (5) that the application of the plaintiff is allowed and it is ordered that the time to bring the within action is extended to September 10, 1994, said order to be retroactive to September 8, 1994;",0.21193415637860083,"FIAT.

The remaining substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether the limitation period should be extended, and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action.

Section 579(2) of the Code allows the Crown to recommence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the stay is entered without the necessity of laying new Information or preferring a new indictment. 4)The limitations period was extended by a factor of 1 years. 5)Limitations on action relating to breaches of duty, breaches of duties, misrepresentation and other causes of action were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of proceedings by the Crown. 6)Statutes of fact are not to be confused with statements of facts.

[44] When I reflect upon the time, effort and money expended in the pursuit of this action by all parties over the past six years, I am convinced that the only reasonable course is to grant a retroactive order. Those parties seek to have the particular pleadings struck on the ground that they enjoy an immunity absent an allegation of malice or bad faith. Absent such an allegation the pleadings disclose no cause of action and should be struck as to the Crown Attorneys. I read the statutory provision as providing immunity to the Saskatchewan Police Commission and people engaged in its work. In my view, the Crown is rendered immune by the express terms of s. 5(6) of the Act from liability to the appellant. [53] As I read the Act and the decisions, I do not conclude that the Crown enjoys an absolute immunity. Therefore, this claim should be permitted to proceed along with the claim based on the Charter of Rights. No advance notice, so far as I know, was given to the other parties. Absent such notice, I am not prepared to entertain the request. (1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed; (2) that the application by the defendants, McGillivray and Johnston, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is dismissed; (3) that the application by the defendants, Quinney, Sullivan and Bauer, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is allowed and paragraphs 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 of the statement of claim are struck, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to apply to amend the pleadings; (4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights; (5) that the application of the plaintiff is allowed and it is ordered that the time to bring the within action is extended to September 10, 1994, said order to be retroactive to September 8, 1994;",0.3710094909404659,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions sought an order pursuant to the Rules of the Public Officers' Protection Act and an extension of a limitation period nunc pro tunc. With the consent of the plaintiff, the Court ordered that the action against the Attorney General be dismissed. The remaining substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether the limitation period should be extended, and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the other issues were set aside. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. The limitation period was not extended. 2)The Court was of the view that it was improper to dismiss the claim simply because it was a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. 3)Limitation of actions were substantive in character as opposed to procedural. Section 579(2) of the Code allows the Crown to recommence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the stay is entered without the necessity of laying new Information or preferring a new indictment. 4)The limitations period was extended by a factor of 1 years. 5)Limitations on action relating to breaches of duty, breaches of duties, misrepresentation and other causes of action were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of proceedings by the Crown. 6)Statutes of fact are not to be confused with statements of facts. The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the parties to proceed pro rata.","In the one the defendants, the Government of Saskatchewan, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer, seek an order pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff\'s claim stand dismissed:

(i) the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General for Saskatchewan;

(ii) the entirely of the claim against C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and

(iii) the claim against the Government of Saskatchewan (except for that part of the claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights). [2] In the second motion the defendants, Wayne McGillivray and Michael Johnston, also seek to have the plaintiff\'s claim dismissed. Likewise, their application is grounded in Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, but they also rely on Rule 173(e). [3] The third motion is brought by the plaintiff who seeks several orders of which two were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. [4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed. That rule provides for a determination of a point of law. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. [5] As I see it, the remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be summarized as follows. (1) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim is barred by a statutory limitation period. (3) Whether a portion of the plaintiff\'s claim fails to disclose a cause of action against Quinney, Sullivan, Bauer, McGillivray and Johnston because there is no allegation of malice. (4) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan is barred by statute. The plaintiff claims general damages, special damages, punitive damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs. Accordingly the plaintiff's claim is determined to be statute-barred upon Section 51 of the Limitation of Actions Act.  The cause of action had fully accrued and the appellant had a prima facie case. To fairly determine whether that was so, there must be a hearing to determine the facts and that is best done at trial. The appeal must be allowed. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs under double Column V, and the (sic) other below is set aside. Accordingly, the application to dismiss the plaintiff's claim as being statute barred should be dismissed. The plaintiff now applies for an order granting such further time, the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. He has demonstrated a prima facie cause of action and I need say no more about that. When I consider the condition and state of the plaintiff at the relevant time, together with all of the presenting circumstances, a reasonable explanation for the delay has been put forward. [42] Most importantly, I am satisfied that no prejudice will flow to the defendants.

b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment.

It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt is a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment.

e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied by notice of motion dated June 26, 2006, to vary the judgment of Justice Foley.

9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied to the Court for judicial review to quash two orders made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in the subpoena duces tecum and in a series of production orders, process that infringes the substantive rights of the Board. The Board declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record. There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or why it rejected all the submissions made by counsel for Wal- Mart Canada respecting it. The only reference to the relevancy requirement is that the Board did not address Mr. Beckman's concerns or objections in any meaningful fashion but ignored them.","[1] Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to The Queen’s Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004.

There is accordingly no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy respecting the documents specified in the subpoena or the host of documents that might fall within the ambit of the generalized terms of the subpoena.

The third exception was that the Board did not have jurisdiction to authorize the plaintiff to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was not without jurisdiction. The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal.  1) It is not in dispute that the board has adopted pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and Functional analysis. 2) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or to make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced.

There is accordingly no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy respecting the documents specified in the subpoena or the host of documents that might fall within the ambit of the generalized terms of the subpoena. [57] The second reason for my conclusion that the Board abused its jurisdiction and power respecting the subpoena, is that the subpoena is far too generalized and, in reality, amounts in many instances to an order to discover documents. [66] Many of the comments I have made respecting the subpoena duces tecum issued by the Board in this case, apply in principle to the Board’s document discovery and production orders. I have concluded for the reasons I will outline, that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its powers in making the discovery and production orders it did against Wal-Mart Canada. [81] As well, the Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeal. In my view, the only feasible option open to me is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two impugned orders. 1. The orders of the Board dated May 21, 2004 and June 14, 2004 are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. 2. The short-term stay of the proceedings of the Board that extended on July 13, 2004 is terminated forthwith. 3. The application by Wal-Mart Canada for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back to the Court after the Board has rendered its decision or once Wal-Mart Canada can provide a better factual foundation and context to support its application.",0.523725834797891,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing them. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the union. The applicant objected to the subpoenas and sought the production of additional documents. The respondent denied having the authority to subpoena or make the disclosure and production orders but maintained that it had the jurisdiction to do indirectly what it could do directly. Wal- Mart Canada declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. Counsel for the Board conceded that two exceptions were made to the general rule that error of law must appear on the face of the record. The third exception was that the Board did not have jurisdiction to authorize the plaintiff to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was not without jurisdiction. The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal.  1) It is not in dispute that the board has adopted pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and Functional analysis. 2) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or to make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review the relevancy or privilege of the affidavit evidence. 3) The portions would normally have been struck. 4) The application is adjourned to June 10, 2004 and continued on June 11, 2004. The hearing was adjourned for a further time. 5) The issues on appeal are summarized in the amended notice of motion and detailed legal brief filed by the parties.

[11] UFCW brought an application before the Board for an order for certification respecting certain employees of Wal-Mart Canada at its Weyburn store. The application is contested by Wal-Mart Canada and by certain Wal-Mart Canada employees who are designated by the Board as “Interested Parties”. With respect to items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, given that issues have been raised with respect to employer influence or interference and the status of department managers, we are of the opinion that the Employer shall produce the following documents: “Wal-Mart Manager’s Toolbox to Remaining Union Free”; the current “Wal-Mart Associate Handbook”; the document entitled “To the New Wal-Mart Associate” and other documents provided to newly hired employees; Corporate Policies CPD-42 and COP-08 as referred to in the Wal-Mart Associate Handbook; documents and communication to employees regarding trade unions or unionization; documents regarding the operational status of store departments and the concept of “Store within Store”.

A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement with the children every second weekend. The husband objected that the wife was abusive of the children. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the spouses were unable to communicate effectively with each other and the children did not have access to the other parent's information. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the child's best interest. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication between them. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as messengers.","Result: The children were placed in the husband’s sole care and custody. I did not find the wife to be a credible witness and a further example of this was her allegation that the husband when deployed at sea “would not allot funds from his pay directly to me while he was gone....”. However, the intervening conflict has caused the wife to perceive herself as a victim of the husband’s abuse; it has exposed her own lack of insight into the dynamics of their relationship and the impact upon their children; her reflex action is not to cooperate with the husband; she now has little respect for him. A track record of respectful parenting may alter this conclusion in the future but for the present I find it to be in the best interest of these children to be in the sole custody and care of the husband. Therefore the wife shall continue to pay child support to the husband as is required by the terms of the Interim Order dated August 26, 2009.",0.46629213483146076,"This was a divorce proceeding. The parties had been in a relationship for approximately years. They had two children and years of age. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The children were in the husband's care every second weekend. The husband requested sole custody with the children in the wife's care. The court found that the wife had demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. She did not take the opportunity to meet with the husband personally and of the requests he made in respect of the children. She often did not reply to his inquiries. HELD: While shared parenting is inappropriate for these children what about joint custody? Conflict between parents does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. The evidence suggests what violence there has been between the parties was often initiated by the wife. However, this did not occur with the consent of the husband. Discussions about what is an appropriate decision to make for child's benefit should not be overwhelmed in a power struggle between the parents.",0.5027624309392266

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and operating a vehicle that was in possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cannabis marihuana in an amount exceeding 3 kilograms, for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 249(1)(a) and s. 267(a). The subsequent questions pertaining to the gym bag were improper. At the moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the accused. The accused's words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. HELD: The evidence was excluded. 1) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. If the aroma of liquor or drug is evident, the question then becomes one of the proper test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. The Court found that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the accused's vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both. 2) The Court held that the evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded. 3) There was no quarrel with the visual inspection of the vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the car. Although the safety of the police might make it preferable to use the flashlight at the earliest opportunity, it certainly can be utilized at any time as necessary incident to the check stop routine.","[1] The Crown proceeded against the accused on the following five counts in the indictment:

The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.

This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there is no suggestion that the subject matter of the action, the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action, were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitor. HELD: The application is dismissed. Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel, the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that is, one which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. Review of the file herein suggests that no such strategy exists. The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. In the earlier application, the tendency to use applications of this sort as harassment technique was used. Once it was determined that there was no actual knowledge of the case in question and that there could be no real knowledge of one being attributed to the other, the onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern.","The applicant seeks to have the firm, Robertson

W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, we are satisfied that he recognized their importance and that he did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. R. v. Mah, 2002 NSCA 99 (CanLII). Read as a whole, we are satisfied that the judge properly assessed all of the evidence, recognizing throughout that the ultimate issue was not credibility but reasonable doubt. [12] For all of these reasons we would dismiss the appeal.",0.44723618090452266,"The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. She now appeals her conviction on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and the defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In assessing all the evidence the judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility but proof to criminal standard. This information sheet does not form part of the court's judgment. Quotes must be from the judgment, not this cover sheet. The full court judgment consists of pages. The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that she went to use the bathroom, but only to smoke the rest of her drugs in private without having to share it with others. She denied ever seeing his wallet, robbing or strangling the victim or being part of a plan to rob him.",0.4103448275862069

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the law with respect to consolidation has become unclear since the advent of the new Rules. There is no evidence before the Court to establish that the series of transactions are all part of the same transaction as contemplated by Rule 37.02. The Court found that there was a common question of law and fact arising out of the management and supervision of similar investment accounts over a similar period of time.

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The defendant sold business equipment to the plaintiff in September of 2007. The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. HELD: The Plaintiff had not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities and the defendant was not in breach of the agreement. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within two years of the claim being discovered. The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment which can be loosely categorized as the Cash Equipment and the Camera Equipment. The Cash Equipment was designed to enter and receive payments for purchases at the Inn, mostly restaurant purchases. The Camera Equipment is designed to provide security and to monitor the employees of the business. The Plaintiff signed an agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with the equipment and that they would inspect it or have someone else look at it to establish if anything was wrong with it. The Defendant did not do this and despite continuing to make regular payments on the equipment, had done nothing further to ensure that it was working for the purposes for which it was designed. The conclusion from the evidence was that there was no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff's claim to succeed. There was no material representation and no fraud. The defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and installed and it was in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times.","The Defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damages for unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000.00.

[29] If however, I am incorrect in my application of the law in regard to The Limitations Act, I would further find that there was an agreement to supply and install the business equipment but that in my view of the evidence, the Defendant completed his part of the transaction. [30] I further find there was no material representation and no fraud. [31] I must conclude from the evidence I have heard that there is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff’s claim to succeed. There is further no evidence of unjust enrichment. [32] In my opinion, the Plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities and I therefore must dismiss this action.

b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.",HELD: The Court held that it did not support the plaintiff's theory of causation (post-partum hemorrhage caused by retained products of conception and failure to perform C) resulting in the ultimate hysterectomy. The Court also found that the hospital staff were negligent in the performance of their professional duties and services upon the plaintiff by failing to remove the vaginal bleeding from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure (D & C). The Court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the nurses' notes were prepared in circumstances any different from those in Ares v. Venner.,"On September 29, 1992, some 34 days
following the birth of her daughter, Cheryl was admitted on an
emergency basis at the Victoria Union Hospital in Prince
Albert, as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginal
bleeding. She was returned to the operating
room where Dr. Urbanski eventually had to perform a
hysterectomy. Central to
the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the
defendant is that the likely cause of Cheryl's ongoing or
recurring bleeding, on and after September 29, 1997, was
retained products of conception, which Dr. Urbanski failed to
remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure
(""D & C""). Dr. Urbanski's credibility is challenged on the
issue as to whether or not he actually performed the D & C, a
procedure which Cheryl alleges would have remedied the
hemorrhaging which in turn would have obviated the necessity
of performing the hysterectomy. Given the
rarity of this condition and the paucity of documented medical
knowledge thereon, I do not believe that Dr. Urbanski can be
faulted for what he did and for what eventually occurred. The evidence
does not support the suggestion that in this case, a D & C
would have cured the hemorrhage, originating as it did from
the lower cervix. CONCLUSION In summary the Court concludes as follows: 1. The plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant
was negligent in his treatment of her. 3. The plaintiff has failed to prove that the
hysterectomy she had to undergo on October 3, 1992, was the

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan.

As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.

HELD: The Court found that the accused was not trying to evade the police officer. The Court accepted the evidence of the Alberta Court of Appeal. The defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that he had consumed a few beers in the evening and then decided to go for spin. The offence was committed when the accused turned on his emergency lights and the drinking history was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the history he gave to alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott.,"[1] Vincent Lehman is charged with driving a vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of .08 (under s. 253(1)(b)) and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer (under s. 249.1(2)), all on August 17, 2013 at Togo.

(3) Whether Mr. Lehman had a reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the police officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. [28] I am satisfied that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove, and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. As a result, given that finding, where the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick and Mr. Lehman is at odds, I reject the evidence of Mr. Lehman and accept the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. [29] For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning: [30] As I am not satisfied that there was a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning, there is not in my view a basis to apply the opinions given by Ms. Scott. As a result, and as I am satisfied that all other prerequisites in s. 258(1)(c) have been proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not have a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman’s blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. There is no doubt, based on the evidence, that Mr. Lehman knew he was being pursued by a police officer who had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that Mr. Lehman did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. [33] Considering Mr. Lehman’s evidence, I am not satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. [36] As a result, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman operated a motor vehicle while being pursued by Cst.

CONCLUSION [37] For the reasons I have stated, Mr. Lehman is found not guilty on the impaired driving charge (count 1), guilty on the over .08 charge (count 2) and guilty on the flight from police charge (count 3).",0.4464993394980185,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08. The accused offered a 'last drink' defence, that alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on the impaired driving charge and on the over.08 charge. The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was not trying to evade the police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. The Court was not satisfied that the accused attempted to get away from the officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point. The evidence of the last drink was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the one given to the accused. The defence called alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott and claimed the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before driving and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of what he drank that day and night.",0.4220994475138121

He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was found guilty of two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was observed from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. The Crown's motion for observation post privilege was granted and the accused was allowed to make full answer and defence despite not knowing the exact address from which the police officers observed the transaction. The evidence of the police officer who observed the accused walk back up Uniacke Street to the corner of Gottingen Street where he encountered a black male in the crosswalk and then with apparently no answer proceeding down the street to the rear corner of the store. The police officer testified that there appeared to be a conversation that was not audible and that the accused gestured to another place for the deal to take place. The trial turned very much on the facts of the case that the Court will find having regard to all of the evidence and whether the accused stashed these drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction.","Result: Accused found guilty on both counts.

After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached.

The accused had consumed four or five drinks. There was no other observable signs of impairment. The officer asked the accused to enter the police vehicle where he asked him to provide sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the instrument registered failure, the accused was arrested for impaired driving and read his right to counsel as follows: There is an informational duty, which is not an issue in this case. The trial judge was entitled to review, re-examine and re-weigh the evidence, but only for the purpose of determining if the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) There is no breach of s. 10(b) and whether evidence should be excluded are both questions of law. Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination. 2) The voir dire is the accused's right to speak to counsel of the accused’s choice. The fact remains that when the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned and another name was sought from and provided by the accused. When that computer search resulted in a large number of names, once again the officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of named names. There really is no similarity. The name was that of relative who was known to the complainant. It was most unlikely he would mistakenly pronounce the name. At all times he was alert, quiet and polite. His speech was not slurred.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order.

b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 (property) to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act.

3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father of one child applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The mother was underemployed and the father had not obtained full-time employment with another employer. The father's decision to work only three months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. The court reviewed the father's financial position and found that he had not been successful on this motion. The Court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  2) On all of the evidence, the father was found to be unemployed. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful.  3) The court determined that the father is underemmployed. He has not been able to find employment that is reasonable in light of the substantial delays in this proceeding and the fact that his child support application was commenced in June of 2002. It is also clear that the discovery motion which heard in this matter would not have been necessary had the father provided appropriate financial disclosure.","Mr. Pilat applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.’s order.

Mr. Pilat\'s income is, for the purpose of this application, imputed to be the sum of $40,000.00.

[28] As regards Mr. Pilat\'s request for a retroactive variation, I have determined that the same is warranted. In light of the fact that Mr. Pilat\'s previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, Ms. Lilley may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive pursuant to my order will be payable on a net of tax basis. (1) Mr. Pilat, having income imputed to him in the sum of $40,000.00, shall pay child support to Ms. Lilley, pursuant to s. 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines in the amount of $328.00 per month commencing September 1, 2002, and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter. Based upon extraordinary extracurricular expenses in the annual sum of $2,000.00, Mr. Pilat will pay his proportionate share in the sum of $84.00 per month commencing September 1, 2002, and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter.",0.43986254295532645,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.

In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.

The plaintiff alleged that it did not proceed with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved.

The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 2)Rule 547 is not a code which confines the court's jurisdiction to those areas particularly mentioned in the rule. The common law has not been supplanted entirely by the rule and the court is still permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure by ordering security in instances not covered by the Rule. 3)The court has the power to order security in all cases where it is thought just to do so. In the case of a joint claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs which could be awarded to it in the event of successful defence, in excess of $55,000, in circumstances where the plaintiff no longer carried on business and was without assets, the Court is not persuaded that thereby the parties would be more inclined to enter into meaningful settlement discussions as alleged.","[1] The defendant ""SaskPower"" seeks an order pursuant to

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

He agreed the delay had not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. 3)The delay was caused by scheduling delays which occurred as a result of defence counsel's application to remove the prosecuting counsel prior to the preliminary hearing. 4)The Crown did not share in the responsibility for the delay.,0.524822695035461
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. Hrynewich Holdings dealt with circumstances similar to the case at hand. The appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Under the provisions of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act the right of a lender to recover the unpaid balance of mortgage securing the purchase price of farmland is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates as well as to any collateral security including a guarantee. 2) The respondent bank was found to be the controlling authority in this case. The appellant bank was entitled to take out the deficiency judgment against the mortgage balance.  3) The decision in Andrew (CA) would not have been made had it not been for the appellant bank's decision to apply the proceeds of sale against the balance owing on the purchase money portion of the loan and then pursue Mr. Andrew on his personal liability to pay the non-purchase money portion. 4) The court found that s. 25 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,000.01) to be applied to purchase money debt and (most likely, non-Purchase money) on a pro rata basis to determine the amount of deficiency judgment.  5) The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the ss.25 of the Code and held that the amount owed by the appellants was $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $372,582.48. The remaining LCRA protection was $1,066.72. The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take into account the balance owed.","Appeal allowed [5] There are two issues to determine: a) how should the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of the deficiency judgment? That is, forty-six percent ($105,100) is to be applied to the debt represented by the prior mortgage, and fifty-four percent ($123,400) is to be applied to the remainder. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed. [30] Finally, the decision in Hrynewich Holdings accords with the view of Professor Cuming that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions. [36] The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 as at March 23, 2016, against the appellants. The appeal will also be allowed to this extent.
