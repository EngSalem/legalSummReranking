He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The accused plead guilty to five theft related charges. He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He used his position of authority as police chief to commit these crimes. The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000. He is 43 years of age and a retired police officer. He has a no record and has been industrious throughout his lifetime. He will receive temporary leaves of absence. The accused plead not guilty to one count of fraud and one count for conspiracy to commit theft. The Court called for a combined sentence of twenty months."
b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce is suspended on the application for an order pursuant to s. 11(1) of the Farm Security legislation.  1) The applicant asks the registration be discharged. The reason the legislature provided a suspension in s. 22 of the Act is because the limitation periods have substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention. Once the suspension is suspended, the notice of intent is deemed to have expired. This absurd result would not flow just to the respondent in its unique circumstances. Acceptance of the respondent's interpretation of the legislation would lead to a situation where any and all mortgagees of farm lands could entirely avoid any limitation period applying to their mortgage by the simple devise of serving notice of intentions under the Farm security Act. 2) The Limitations Act requires debtors and contractual obligees to commence enforcement proceedings within the applicable limitation period, failing which the right to enforce was lost. The legislature could not have intended what the respondent argues. The purpose of the farm security act is to prevent mortgagees from foreclosing on farmers who have a reasonable possibility of and who are making sincere and reasonable effort to meet their obligations. The Farm Security acts provide for a three-year limitation period running from the date of registration to the date that notice of intend is served. The time for making an application is deemed over and the limitation is deemed in the time period set out in the Limitations act. 3) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Limitation of Actions Act does not apply to mortgagees. The Limitation Act provides that notice to the borrower in the period leading up to the issuance of the notice. The Court found that it would be manifest injustice to mortgagee if the three- year limitation period had expired and the resulting notice of action was deemed to be invalid. The applicant was awarded the taxable costs of her application against the respondent."

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.",The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement of the personal injury claim on behalf of the infant plaintiff. The issue before the Court was the amount of the Contingency Fee Agreement payable to the petitioner. The petitioner had not registered the Contringency Fee Agreements with the Prothonotary's Office as required and the matter had been adjourned for one week pending receipt of a Memorandum of Law. Counsel were instructed to present to the Court an appropriate bond. This bond was approved.
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) Given that the presumption of care and controlling was rebutted, the trial judge considered whether the accused had rebutled the presumption, just barely, that the appellant had been in actual care or control. The trial judge found that, in the circumstances of the case, that was the only defence he had. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings. 2) Given the accused's evidence that he rebutts the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as to rebut the presumption that it is retrospective, and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. The accused rebutting the presumption by adding the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving, to the test which would be required of an accused attempting to establish 'evidence to the contrary' so as rebut to the statutory presumption of accuracy, was found to be ineffective. 3) The trial court found that the trial court erred in finding that the accused rebuffed the presumption (as opposed to the presumption) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and Control of the vehicle. The evidence showed that the officer had calibrated the instrument and the blood alcohol concentration of the accused to rebus the presumption so that it was retrospective. The error was fatal to the appellant's defence."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant was found guilty of criminal liability causing death (s. 220); causing death in the operation of motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (s.) 255(3); criminal negligence in the performance of bodily harm (s."") and causing death while impaired (s). The appellant appealed her convictions and raised several grounds of appeals. Allowing the appeal reducing the appeal to a matter of probabilities, that the trial judge erred in law in refusing to grant stay of all charges, when he had determined that the appellant's ability to operate a motor car was impaired by impaired byalcohol (s) 255(2). The trial judge further erred by making inconsistent findings concerning the impact of the Charter breach upon the refusal charge in his attempt to fashion remedy."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The Students' Union and the Students'' Union appealed a Queen's Bench decision declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The issues to which the parties appealed were the result of a referendum held in 2005 and the respondent's role in the referendum process. The FOI argued that the respondent had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs.  1) The FOIA argued that it was important not to confuse the statutory concepts of oppression, unfairly prejudicial actions and actions which unfairly disregard interests (as set out in s. 225 of the Act) with the various aspects of the common law that typically form the basis of judicial review applications such as the one considered in the Walton case. 2) The Chambers judge did not err in his treatment of the respondent. He did not refer to the respondent as a former director. The parties argued that, even if he had standing, the respondent still had standing to make an application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the act. The issue, however, was whether the respondent has standing to do so.  3) The Court of Queen's Land considered the following issues in relation to the referendum: 1) the respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application; 2) the Court of Appeal did not accept that the students' Union had abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the referendum result; and 4) the Chambers Judge did not advise the parties that he had'short-term written instructions' to the applicant. The respondent had standing as president of the Students’ Union at the time of the referendum and had participated in the debate on the issue of joining the FSF. The Chambers Judge was unable to advise the respondent on the status of his application. The appeal was dismissed with cost."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge applied the test that showed he was more than twice the legal limit, but the impaired driving charge was stronger and the accused offered an innocent explanation for his impairment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The mechanism for doing so is the entering of a partial judicial stay (CCS253(a)). The trial court cannot use the readings to come to a conclusion as to what quantity of alcohol was consumed or what effect, vis-à-vis impairment such consumption of alcohol had on the particular accused. The evidence as to the accused's driving behaviour was attributable to his hurt ankle and was not as result of any impairment from the considerable alcohol that he had, he had drank. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than half the legal maximum.' The trial decision was not based on direct observations of the breath demand. Hearsay: The accused was more then twice the legally limit. The Court is obliged to resolve the matter by order of the Provincial Court Judge."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. The appellant had not challenged the Board's decision to award the tax on the basis that the documents were specifically ordered by the appellant and were not for resale. The Board found that the purchase of the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates the anomaly. The appeal is allowed and it is reversed that the Board erred in its conclusion that the documentation is not required to prepare the valves For use in Sask. The assessment is based on the finding of fact that the document was not necessary for preparing for use here. HELD: Appeal allowed. The decision of the Board was reversed. 1)The evidence before this board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase than documentation charges. Thus, the documentation stands as tangible personal property and is subject to tax as such by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act unless the Appellant can claim an exemption under s.8(1) of The Act. 2)The Board's definition of 'published' was not difficult to analyze. It was more appropriate to focus on the relationship between the purchase and the documentation than on whether the documentation charges were part of a purchase or consideration in establishing the final price of the valves. Thus the documentation stood as tangible property and was subject to the tax by virtue and was reasonably accessible."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment. The accused was convicted of assault contrary to s.(1)(a) the Criminal code. The trial judge quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench on the basis that the trial judge erred in both ways. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the judge did not err in his reasons nor did he express an inconsistency with the accused's statement that the finger incident occurred twice. The judge did, however, address the appellant's assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing and focused on the fact there were two officers present. The appellant's mistake was reasonable, one that an ordinary person using ordinary care could have made in the same circumstances. The officer who was subject to the pepper spray applied the appropriate amount of force but did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. The appeal judge found that both the trial and the trial judges erred. The first issue was whether the appellant was in imminent danger of death or grievous bodily harm and that his action was necessary in self-defence. The Appeal judge found the trial officer to be in error in that he did not directly direct himself on all of relevant evidence, and in particular the trial Judge did not address the complainant's assessment about the options offered to him. The issue was proportionality. The decision to grant leave to the appeal judge was not explicitly stated in the decision of the trial court but was not implicit in the reasoning of the Court."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The appellant filed a complaint under Part II of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code alleging that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The appellant claimed that the city had done everything it could to accommodate him because of his Cerebral Palsy. The tribunal found that the appellant had not been properly advised of the potential for discrimination based on his disability and had therefore made its decision within the limitation period. The applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; the City's failure to accommodate the appellant on the ground that the Code is not a progressive disease and the fact that the applicant had overcome a considerable time delay in obtaining a permanent position did not result in the discrimination he alleged. The fact that this was a case where the City could have accommodated the appellant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship was found to have been the deciding factor. The decision of the tribunal was therefore reasonably accurate in this case and denied the appellant's claim to permanent status. The appeal was dismissed with costs."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel.

The police had investigated a previous incident where the accused had assaulted another street person on the porch. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and his right not to ask for counsel again. He was then asked if he wanted to call a lawyer. The defence submitted that the accused was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day and so the police would have been required to clear up any misunderstanding he may have had. Regarding the first statement, the accused testified that he chose not to avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of a person of the same name. He also stated that he did not recall the events that day. The second statement, made voluntarily, was found to have exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of his rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. The Court held that access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. The Crown sought admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. The court held that the second statement could not have been made because the accused wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The trial judge found that the defence was not focused on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement to the police. His question, 'Where is a lawyer?' created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the Crown to offer a rebuttable evidence."

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

The court granted the defendants leave to proceed on a motion requesting leave. The third parties had not established that the impugned claim could succeed. It was argued that the provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third party claims be struck out pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a)? 1) The claim is arguable. It is stated in the pleadings of the parties that the cause of the action is the common law and not the fact that the third Parties did not act in good faith. If this is established then it is clear that the statutory limitations would not nullify the third Party claim. 2) The third party claimants need not be satisfied that the defendants have deliberately destroyed evidence or that they did so in goodfaith. The defendants owe a duty to assist the thirdparty in gathering evidence. The only reasonable ground of appeal is that the statements of claim disclose a cause of act. The common law does not disclose this evidence. Third parties must not be in good standing to bring a third party action. It would be impossible for the defendants to accomplish their stated duty. 3) The only defence the third would be to attack the city for failing to act in a reasonable manner is the allegation of negligence for an omission to act, which is not an arguable case. The principles of the Rule of Law and the Contributory Negligence Act prevent the defendants, who are subject to their duty to act reasonably, from taking action against third parties. The Court held that the common laws do not disclose evidence of reasonable cause. 4) The Court was satisfied that there was no evidence that the Third Parties did act in bad faith. The allegations were relevant in respect to the contention that the defendant did not owe a statutory duty to the third. If the statutory limitation would not be established then the Court was clear that statutory limitations could not nullified the third-party claim."

There had been numerous changes in circumstances which went beyond the single issue referred back. The petitioner intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access but was unaware he is required to serve notice under the Constitutional Questions Act.","The parties agreed that the respondent was no longer residing in the trailer court and that they would share joint custody.

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from Saskatchewan until she obtained a Court order allowing her to do so. The petitioner and her new common law husband had been discussing for some time how best to deal with the child's needs. In the last year, the child has been experiencing problems at home and at school. The child took the child to Dr. Verma in Swift Current who prescribed Ritalin, suspecting that the child suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The Ritaline did not have the desired effect and the child was referred to the psychiatrist. The respondent and the petitioner have now decided that it would be in the best interests of the child be moved from Eastend to live with his father and common law wife in Edmonton.

The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. The university continued to receive its vested interest in the pension to the extent described in the order of December 19, 1985. In the event that either party required further clarification of their intentions regarding the division of the University of Regina pension plan, either party was granted leave to apply for further directions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The university was to make monthly payments to the respondent of her vested share. Whether this is converted to a lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the university and the applicant. 2)The share vested in the applicant was not now in any way under the control of the applicant for the same reasons as the share vested of the respondent which was not converted to lump sum payments. The 40% share, having vested in her, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the respondent. 3)The order of January 1985 did not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly the 40% portion, having been vested in this university, is not a share her may dealwith without reference or the consentof, or the respondent, Russell."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The husband reported to the Family Court it sought intervention because his alone could no care for her child. He sought rescission of the order on Rule 1.04 of the Family Code Rules. The Family Court Judge in rejecting the application dismissed the appeal.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.",The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code and unlawfully care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss.255(3) of the Code. The accused was found not guilty on both counts. The Court held that it was fundamental that the party introducing opinion evidence based upon hypothetical facts has the burden of establishing those facts in evidence. Impairment is an issue of fact which the trial judge must decide on the evidence. The evidence of the accused' testimony was found to be frail as to leave the trial jury with a reasonable doubt. Viva voce evidence was heard at the time of the trial.
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, who did not appear at trial and entered a defence of his claim for damages. The defendant, Hyndman, had also entered a silent agreement to pay the plaintiff's outstanding lease payments and for repairs. HELD: The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against Hyndmans was dismissed. 1)Although there was no specific contract with respect the repair of the vehicles, it was clear that the defendant had made some payments on behalf of the plaintiff. Although there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases, the defendant was prepared to assume that risk. 2)The plaintiff had not been fully aware of the risk to its lease arrangement at the time of the discussions. It is clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence at trial that he did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. 3)The defendant was aware that there was an issue to the lease arrangement because it was insolvencially insolvent and that the plaintiff might not make payments on the leased vehicles. It was clear from the defendant's notes that there were verbal orders to make repairs. The plaintiff was prepared, however, to assume the risk.  4)The actions taken by both parties were taken for the benefit of the company. The actions taken for its benefit were taken in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor Hyndwoman benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. The facts did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the defendant based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He was employed for 5 years as guidance counsellor at the education complex. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of post secondary education programs and remained in that position until 1997. He now seeks damages for his wrongful dismissal claim. HELD: The claim for punitive or aggravated damages cannot succeed. The plaintiff was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been erroneously dismissed for just cause. The facts did not justify dismissal. 2)The court did not find any insubordination or insubstantial negligence on the part of the board members of the education system who had done their jobs for the employer. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any more than the contract provided for and that they had acted in a fashion inconsistent with their express or implied belief. The Court found that punitive or aggravating damages were rarely awarded in contract cases where the injured party is essentially entitled to no more than what the contract provides.
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: 1) The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983. In 2003, the majority of the claim related to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges it is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as personal use should be 50 percent. Both parties have acknowledged that the capital cost allowance can be legitimate expense of self-employed individual and should not be added back to income without some evidence to show all or part of the deduction is not appropriate. Assuming that the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered, he will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court allows those arrear to be paid monthly. There is no reason why the overpayment by the father should not to be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances. 2) The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. The Court was not prepared to add back to the expense in any of the three years the amount was claimed in the statement."

Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route, which was the one suggested by the trial judge. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawolina as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial court on the matter of costs. 3)The trial judge ordered the defendant to pay solicitor/custodial costs taxed immediately. Even with Siemens substantially unsuccessful in her allegation of wrongdoing against Bawola, still he ought, he should to pay this costs because his caused the cost of the Pre-trial Production by his delaying tactics. 4)The court was impressed with the level of cooperation between the defendant and the plaintiff.

The issue ofresponsibility arose from the sorry state of his records. The contempt has been purged sufficiently to permit the Court to withdraw from further intervention.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus.

HELD: 1) The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the penitentiary for the past year. The true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of the prison. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction.

d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties executed a separation agreement that provided for the maintenance of their matrimonial home and matrimony assets. The husband received $60,000 in addition to the $1,500 in monthly maintenance. The wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so that she could increase the maintenance provision and retain the asset division. She also sought to retain the mortgage on the house and add an additional $9,000 to her car insurance policy. The court found that the mortgage was unreasonably high in the amount of $60k and that there were no factors that warranted the change in the terms of the separation contract. Matrimonial property laws do not have special provisions to allow the court to vary the maintenance provisions of a marriage contract or separation agreement."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the jury trial be heard by jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable that an issue will eventually put an ending to the proceedings. The Court in Beddow v. Megyesi dismissed the application. There was no evidence to establish the causation of the injuries beyond the fact that the plaintiffs sustained injuries consistent with the causes of the accident. Such evidence would necessitate an examination of the injury and the origin of the causation, which would necessitated an examination by experts of the nature of the cause. This evidence would be required to establish both the origin and cause of the causal relationship between liability and damage. The plaintiff's claim was grossly exaggerated and would be impossible to establish with the evidence. The defendants were awarded leave to apply anew to sever the trial."

Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.

The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid of the accused. The trial judge refused to commissar the application and found that the applicant had not properly instructed and acted reasonably in accordance with the instructions of the trial judge.

The court found that there was evidence before the trial court upon which a jury, properly instructed, and acting reasonably in their manner could convict the accused of first degree murder. Dismissing the application, that the trial evidence did not support a conclusion that the respondent aided or abetted the accused in committing the offence charged.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and with breaking s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of the regulations. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s27 of the act. The accused was convicted of unlawfully angling. The Fisheries Act does not give the accused that power. Exhibit P1 is not a document valid on its face. It purports to revoke the accused's licence and prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence. There is no valid s. 27 revocation or prohibition in place so as to invalidate the licence."

The Crown had to be sure the accused intended to use the push dag to cause injury or death to persons or intended to used it for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. 2)The Court disagreed with the argument that an inference of the accused's intent in having the concealed push dagger drawn could be drawn.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied to have the court find that he was in breach of the parties' inter-spousal agreement in that it provided that he would pay child support in the amount of $450 per month for each child and that there was no agreement to continue the relationship. The trial judge found that the daughters had not been able to provide for themselves or to withdraw themselves from the charge of parent if the father paid in the past for them. The mother was awarded child support of $3,644.00 per month. The court found that this was an error and found that it was not reasonable to require the father to pay the amount as it was in error. The evidence did not show that the daughter unilaterally withdrew from the relationship with the father. The fact that the mother had not reciprocated the father’s effort to contact the daughters and that she had failed to collect or account for those expenses and that the court was in agreement that the child would pay support in $3 million. The respondent was awarded retroactive maintenance of $1,000.00."

The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, was in an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services for the defendant's fleet of trucks and associated Equipment. The defendant initially refused to pay its invoices as they became due, and in November 2015 ceased to pay invoicing as they were due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $10,902.32. While the defendant offered oral evidence that it could charge a minimum of three hours for a job that took less time, or a specific charge for miscellaneous parts that exceeded a fair and reasonable price, none of these invoiced results as a result of the defendant not taking issue with the charges. Reliability was awarded $8,614.17. 1)The plaintiff was not awarded prejudgment interest on the amount of $1,550.85 which was to be paid immediately.  2)The court was not satisfied that the defendant could have cobbled together the information it could from the evidence to show that a common price to be charged for goods and services was reached by the parties. The plaintiff should have been prepared to pay more. The evidence was so incomplete as to be misleading. 3)The defendant should not have been able to charge anything that was in excess of the amount it should have. The parties were in agreement that parts would cost a significant amount of money. The invoice showed that the plaintiff negotiated, reduced, and paid the parts. 4)Costs were awarded in the amount amounting to $8.5 million. 5)The amount sought was unreasonable. The court was unable to determine how much of the total costs were awarded. The defendants should have known there would be a charge for hours of work that would not be in excess or in the range of $50 to $60 per hour. The invoice were negotiated, negotiated, and sent to the defendant without any prior prior prior knowledge of the parties' agreement. The amount sought is unreasonable. 6)Cost of travel was assessed at a rate of $8 per hour, which is an industry standard. The claim that the defendants charged too much for travel was dismissed. The fact that the parties did not agree to an implied rate of charge for all of the services, despite the fact that they agreed to charge a fixed rate, and therefore an implied term to charge"
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during the construction of a sewage treatment lagoon. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied for a declaration of intention. The applicant failed to provide the necessary facts on which a decision could be made as to whether there was a fairly arguable defence. Application granted; the defendant's default judgment set aside; the plaintiff's costs of obtaining the default were fixed at $100. The court reviewed the case law and found that a declaration by a solicitor as to the amount of intention required does not constitute an arguable ground. The solicitor filed an application to set aside the default."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. He had assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. He claimed to have been insolvent since 2002 and that his cattle operation had been a 'lifestyle choice' for him. He sold his cattle in 2002 and claimed to be retiring debts owed to them. The subsequent drought and subsequent financial crisis had made it impossible for him to feed his cattle crop and he was forced to rely on a trust fund which he had obtained from the bank. He argued that he had no assets at the time of his assignment and that the trust fund had been used as a means of retiring debts. He also claimed that he was left with virtually no income to pay his mortgage and that he put his family to unnecessary expense by farming. The bankrupt argued that the bank's support system was a 'pathetic and degrading' one and asserted a security interest over the equity. The court found that the bankrupt should be granted an absolute discharge of $8,000 in addition to surplus income and found that this ground had been met. The conditional order granted conditional upon payment of $10,250 composed of $2,250 for surplus income, $8000 for payment to his estate for the benefit of his creditors and a further $8k for payment of half of his Judgment. The bankruptcy judge had the discretion to impose orders requiring payment of the cost award and conditional order of consent in the amount of $50,000 which represented half of the judgment. The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of s. 173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee. The Court found that it would be unfair and unjust to allow the bankrupt to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors. The fact he has no assets should be diminished consideration. The judge found that s.173(1) does not apply to the bankrupt's pattern of breeding and raising cattle with view to selling the calves in the same year and the bankrupt is entitled to a conditional order in the amounts of $20,000 plus $8 million for the purpose of rehabilitation. The administration of justice is paramount and the court found it appropriate to impose a conditional orders of discharge in the sum of $12,000 with a condition that he consent to judgment in the order of half the judgment"
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","The appellant appealed a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary within the Meaning of s. 7(1)(f) and s.7(1.1) of the Guidelines. He instead referred only to the costs of Ashley's Tae Kwan Do and soccer and to Mitchell's soccer and voice lessons. 2) The appellant's liability was for 73% of all eligible s. expenses, which he received tax free. 3) The respondent argued that the chambers judge ought to be considered to have taken into account the total costs of all the extracurricular activities, and to have concluded that roughly half of this was 'extraordinary' within the definition of s7(2,532. The costs of the extramarital activities were similar to those negotiated in the Child Support Order. 4) The Chamber judge did refer only to one of the issues before him, the determination of the proportionate share of s8 expenses that each party should be required to pay, plus determination of eligible s7 expenses."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. The court found that to be patently unreasonable and in the position of the union it was patently unreasonably unreasonable. The issue then became patently reasonable. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. The error in law was not so severe as to meet the standard of patently irrational as defined by the Courts."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each charge of sexual assault (s. 271(1)) as the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA prohibition order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1) as it did in s.476.012 (3). Parliament clearly intended s.485.012 to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together. A lifetime SOIra compliance order is mandatory in these circumstances. The Court of Appeal disagrees with the sentencing judges interpretation of the s.502.013 (2.2) of The Criminal Code. The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offence will be subject to a lifetime SOIIRA compliance ordered. Nothing in the Criminal code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. The clarity of the clause is such that there is no need to resort to other principles of the Act."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not demonstrably unfit. The Court found that the sentence was neither demonstrably harsh nor unreasonably unfit in that the three convictions for obstruction were mere fines. The Appeal Court did not find that the overall sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' either. Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit."

The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent SGI as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

The appellant is entitled to an income replacement benefits based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. The respondent SGE submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB sets the appellant's IRB much lower than that of a skidler operator. HELD: The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. The ratio in Dietner stands for just this proposition. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine the IRBs and the GYEI from which the IRBT is derived. The Court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. The issue is determining the time that the applicant would have actually been employed. The trial judge agreed with the appellant that s. 116 and s. 117 of the Pensions and Benefits Regulations require that an income replace benefit must reflect a claimant's earning realities. The applicant earned no more then $12,000 per year. The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 90 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. Hearsay for the appellant, that s.(1) of the Regulations prescribe the calculations for establishing the gross yearly employment income required for s.117(3) of The Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The legislation strives for one's earning truth. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the one that actually been engaged during the time of the accident. The case in which the appellant was found to be far from that of Cowan, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning reality.

While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the court was whether the respondent was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent's wife, who is divorced from the respondent, is in a new relationship and is in new relationships. The parties have a child, who, although born in July 1996, is the biological son of the respondent and the respondent's child, is not the child of this marriage. The question of whether the petitioner is a child within the meaning of the Divorces Act (as defined by it) was a serious issue for both parties. The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for cases where a step-parent (as opposed to a natural parent) takes over a significant role in the children's life. The Court found that the respondent did not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. This was an important decision. The petitioner stood in the Place of a Parent and the Court awarded the child support award."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were at all material times residents of the Province of Alberta. In August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province Of Saskatchewan. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) this being the language appearing at para. 8, 9 and 10 of the plaintiffs' statement of claim. Twenty-four days has now elapsed. The defendants should be able to provide the disclosure within 40 days of the granting of this order. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Each of the defendants has furnished a draft order. It would be premature to award costs at this stage. The trial judge will be able able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than am able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.",The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent father pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses should be retroactive given the child's limited income; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements set out in s.7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act. The respondent father was ordered to pay 59% of the child care expense for the child. The amount of child care support payable was to be paid by the respondent in equal monthly installments of $100; the respondent mother's contribution to the child’s school program should be 59% being his proportionate share; and 4) costs of the application.
e_2003skqb69.txt,"FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The applicant registered the property under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and under the Trustee in the Bank of Canada Act. The vesting order applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity were adversely affected. Neither HSBC nor the applicant trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. The application for the vesting ordered was granted. The court reviewed the relevant decision in the Clarkson case and found that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the applicant by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act was not impaired by the provisions of the Act. HELD: The application was granted subject to the conditions set out in the Land Tractor Facilitation Regulations. 1) The applicant's interests were not adversely affected if the vestencing order applied granted. 2) The application to the court was granted on the basis that the applicant raised the concerns raised regarding the Bank's jurisdiction to issue the vestment order. Neither the Bank nor the trustee proceeded to foreclosure proceedings. 3) The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, aged 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, was the quantum of child support that would be payable by either party. The mother, who had special needs, wished to relocate to Alberta to marry a different person. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody of both of them. They would reside an equal amount of time in each home. 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children now was stability. That stability was found in their father's home. The children bonded to their mother. 2) The mother was to receive counselling. 3) The father was to have weekly access on alternate weekends. During this period, the mother would also have access on a third day. 4) The children's educational opportunities were limited as the mother was working and lived in a common law relationship. The father's move to Clareshorn, a six hour drive from Saskatoon, would have a significant impact on their quality of contract. The child's needs were met in the father's residence. The alternative was to reside in the home of a friend or relative who was able to support the children in their own home."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of the employee when he entered a grain terminal, where he was engulfed in grain and died of suffocation. The employee was employed at the time of the incident as a contractor for the grain terminal. He was employed in the grain processing plant when the incident occurred. The incident occurred at a loading dock and the employee entered a receiving pit. The defendant was not charged with the general allegation that it failed to ensure his health and well-being was protected but with an offence contrary to s. 148(1) of the Canada Labour Code. The officer testified that he was not aware of the issue at the onset of the workday when the employee was engulfed and suffocated. The evidence did not establish the employee's position that he exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position based on the evidence of the witness that the employee told the employee to look into the receiving pit and that the member of the crew who was in the pit did so. HELD: The employee is not charged. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the defendant suffered serious injury and died from the exposure to the effects of the moving fan blade is part of the reason the Crown characterizes the information about confined space entry as having been buried in hundreds of power point slides. The employees were aware that the moving pit was a hazard to the general public and the fact that many of the employees were in the terminal, making their own decisions, did not constitute negligence or bad faith. The employer was required to provide education to the employee whenever new hazard information was available to the employer and shortly before the employee is assigned a new activity or exposed to a new hazard. The deceased was not found to have been aware of any of the symptoms of the exposure. The court found that the evidence did establish some of the observations made by the employee but it was not enough to establish that the employer was adequately instructed, trained, supervised and informed that the safety of its employees was paramount. The accused was not entitled to rely on the employee’s recollection of events."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, claiming damages for the injuries suffered by two of the plaintiffs. Both were paid damages for their injuries. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The plaintiff now claimed damages for damages for injuries sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of the defendant, GMCL. The defendant motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Steven and Jody Johansson were dismissed. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied and the defendant was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injury by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this court's process. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by the plaintiff, Maria Johansson. The defendants could not rely on the releases given by the two plaintiff, Steven and Johansson as GMCL was not party to the agreement nor was there an intention on their part to extend the benefit of the releases to the plaintiff."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.",FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development in the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre and from giving third reading to and adopting a Bylaw 756/99. The proposed hotel would be connected to the EverGreen Centre by a public walkway and would be free of charge to all visitors. The applicant argued that the proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel were invalid by reason of bad faith and that the respondent had failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The application was granted in part. The respondents were granted an order restraining the respondent: a) from holding any public hearing; b) from giving a third reading; and c) from considering an application for a discretionary use permit by the applicant. The requested relief should be granted in full.  1)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association; and 2) were hotelier vendors.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act was not credible. The issue was whether the appellant had breached its constitutional commitment to the CBRM; whether the CBR's proposed interpretive toolkit was an appropriate test for striking the appellant’s claim. The respondent’d complaints respecting Departmental expenditures and public service employment reference nothing of the kind. The AG’ s. 23 rights are realized, but the province receives equalization funds from Ottawa for that very purpose. The applicant’ll have to negotiate an appropriate settlement with the province."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage firm applied for and was granted a stay of execution on the condition that he disclose the information in his proposed marketing plan to the court. The defendant had purchased a large parcel of land from the plaintiff and had undertaken an extensive marketing campaign. The plaintiff sought to withdraw his claim against the defendant and sought costs on the basis of a previous oral agreement and unjust enrichment. The broker had advised the plaintiff that he would not be bound by the terms of the agreement. The court accepted the plaintiff's request for a stay on execution of the action. HELD: The plaintiff was granted the stay. The Court was satisfied that the defendant had not committed to the terms contained in the agreement between the parties. The issue was whether there was an oral agreement, which was enforceable. The Commission was subject to HST. The Plaintiff carried on his business as a licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg and his clients began to build their marketing reputation. The issues were as follows: 1) was there an oral contract for payment of fixed commission; 2) if there was such an agreement enforceable; in the absence of an enforceable agreement between them, the Plaintiff was entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruit or unjust enrichment; 3) the appropriate amount was the appropriate date."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in that amount. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent had unilaterally transferred their son, ostensibly because he was not receiving sufficient attention at Argyle. The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spousals support and an equal division of family property. The court found the respondent’ s Federal Child Tax Credit to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed interim spouse and child support of $5,250.00. The Court also found the appellant’S Federal Child Services Guidelines to be in excess in excesses of $250,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded interim child care and spouse support in addition to child support and child and child maintenance.  2) The Court reviewed the financial statements and personal tax returns and found the child to be doing well in the chosen field. The children’re educational needs were met primarily through the care of their son. D.K. was an intelligent and pleasant boy, who was generally well-behaved. He was active in the community and enjoyed spending time with his friends. He and the respondent, who had recently moved to Canada, had a son, who resided with them for the past four years. DK.’d been attending Grade 5 at the time of the birth and was doing well academically. He also had a grade 7 education. He worked part-time and was able to assist with the child’ss education and health care needs. The child was attending classes at the school and was involved in the day-to-day activities of the child. The parties had purchased a condominium in Regina and, after some unsuccessful attempts to obtain a home, moved to Saskatoon. The residence was rented by the respondent and the child was generally in the residence with the petitioner. The mother lived with the respondent for the first three months of the school year. The family relocated to Sasktel in 2012 and moved to Ottawa. The following year, the petitioner was given access only three weekends a month and each Wednesday.

The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant who cannot say the claim is vexatiously or frivolous. There may also be an abuse to the process. The facts as pleaded would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true. 4) There is nothing to establish that the statements were made to a board member. The statement is not about the member making a board function at the relevant time. The statements are not about board members carrying out some board function. The member is not trying to identify who was carrying out that function. 5) The plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to establish her claim. The only reasonable cause that she fits within the situation like that in the Mitchell case is that the statement of claims allege malice. Counsel for the defendants submits the affidavits filed serve to negative malice. That is, the claim lacks evidence of the circumstances surrounding the several remarks. None of them speaks to the alleged conduct of the defendant in the workplace. Most of the affidavit filed would not be considered defamation in the circumstances. The"

1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other accused took the stand in defence. They were all of the accused's friends. They beat the accused and stole his belongings. At the end of the attack, the accused threw a punch to the face and punched the other two members of his group. The three of them were hospitalized. The victim suffered serious injuries and severe bruising to his eyes, shoulder blades and temples, bruising to the ribs, bruising and a left ear were his. He required 180 hours of community service following his sentence. The accused was sentenced in part to two year probation with two years probation after pleading guilty to robbery. The Court of Appeal gave the accused two years credit for time in remand, but imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment with two year's probation. This would have resulted in a sentence closer to three years or more and would assist the accused in maintaining his goals."
6_1993canlii4548.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract of a written contract between the parties. The defendant, Nova, counterclaimed for damages based on negligent misrepresentation. Nova paid Sign-o-Lites the sum of $875.00 month as rental, plus sales tax, less provincial sales tax and less monies paid. The defendants counterclaimed on the basis of unjust enrichment. Nova was not liable for any breach of the contract. The alternative claim, which claimed that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for unjust enrichment, was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the transaction, plus provincial sales taxes, less monying paid. Nova should only be compensated for one-half of the amounts for shifting the signs and the electrical work."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the Credit union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit University became tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonsets and was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in s. 72 of the Act. The plaintiff's cross-appeal was not successful on that basis. It was clear that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between Gari. The building was sold to a third party in 2001. However, it was not removed from the Property until the fall of 2002. The actions of Garis following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. The fact that the building was not properly occupied at the time of its removal and Gari paid rent and a security deposit back to the CreditU. The Court of Appeal did not wish to be taken as having resolved the issue of the landlord and the tenant relationship but rather found that s. 35 of the Property Security and Jurisdiction Act does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. The appeal was allowed."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown argues that the learned trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not question the credibility of either of the officers. The Court reviewed the facts and found that the respondent's driving actions were reasonable and not justifiable for being over.08. 2) The Court found that while the trial judge was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case, she failed to take into account that the appellant's drinking was found to be in excess of.08 and that the breath samples taken after the arrest were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. The facts and the evidence of the accused's impairment were found to have been obtained in a fashion inconsistent with normal driving. 3) The accused was cooperative and did not display any signs of impairment. He was not in a state of confusion. He participated in a voluntary U-turn which was a positive test for breathalyzer demand. 4) The evidence of impairment was found in relation to the impaired driving charge. The appellant's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired based on the fact that he had lost his balance and stumbled into his own truck after she had ordered him to return to his vehicle. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired by alcohol were found in a manner consistent with normal behaviour. The evidence was that the officer had used a non-functioning headlamp which could have alerted the driver to the presence of alcohol in the vehicle. However, the officer consciously determined that she would not do an approved roadside screening device demand on the accused. She consciously determined she would make an ASD demand if she suspected driver had alcohol in his body but otherwise did not show sufficient signs of impaired by blood. 5) The breath samples were received directly into the vehicle, which was located about 5 km away from where the appellant was sitting in his vehicle and were analyzed for alcohol on the breath. 6) The officer was of the opinion that the accused was showing signs of moderate to moderate impairment and was unable to locate his documentation. The accused had a blood alcohol level of.04. The breath sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time of the stop and, in the case of the first sample, not later than 2 hours after that time, he was still not able to locate the remains of his"
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial and an order for a new trial. During the course of the hearing, defence counsel disclosed to the court that they had received 27 documents (plus the Index) from the Crown. The Crown sought to attach a number of other documents that had not been disclosed to defence counsel. In the weeks immediately following the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. In those weeks, defence lawyer also questioned Crown counsel about the existence and relevance of the documents. The defence counsel submitted that the Crown had not conducted any meaningful review of the 1,100 documents and merely relied on the description of each document contained in the Index. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge did not err in his decisions regarding the length of the adjournment and the requested time for submissions. The Court found that the trial judge erred in not permitting a review of some of the previously disclosed documents. As the Crown sought a new time for this discovery and for this request for an adjournion, the Court granted the requested leave to make further submissions. As this was a very short time period, the Crown was not prepared to allow the discovery of the document and defence counsel was advised that they would be available in person on a Friday. The delay in making the application was considered because of the length and complexity of the proceedings and because the Crown disclosed the documents to defence."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A.D. The plaintiff was in the middle of a road trip and her vehicle was struck by the police vehicle. She claimed she had to look behind her to see if the lights were on. The defendant testified that he had passed the plaintiff's vehicle at dark section of highway and he did not notice the police car approaching the intersection. He claimed the plaintiff had turned right in front of his vehicle and that he was not sure if the plaintiff’s headlights were on when it was struck. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant was negligent for turning the vehicle right when it passed them. The evidence from the RCMP testified that the vehicle was in near perfect condition and that it was not in any way damaged. Damages were awarded to the plaintiff for $8,000.00. The amount of damages claimed to be in the amount of $10,000 to the defendants was reduced to $1,000 due to the defendant’ s negligent driving. The court was not satisfied by the evidence. The case against the defendant, who was found liable for $1 million in highway and bridge damage, was dismissed. There was no evidence the plaintiff sustained any injuries as a result of the accident."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to have the court to remarry her 10 children and make a division of matrimonial property. The husband was to be given one-half of the only asset the family had. The other half was to become part of a large mortgage or to rental accommodation. HELD: The husband's assets were to be divided equally. He was to claim an exemption for his own house, which was of no value to the wife, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. The court found that under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act it is unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance or to any spouse who has custody of the children. The children in this case were to refer to the spouses and not to the five or ten holdovers from the wife's first marriage."

The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He claimed that his breaks were for lunch and an unpaid supper break when he was dismissed from the job. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a 15 minute break for lunch on the basis of his hours of work and overtime. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime and because he was being chased by the company's surveillance team. Awarding the plaintiff $15 for an hour of work over an eight hour period, that day he spent approximately 40 minutes on the computer analyzing the hours of hours of driving and overtime, and then taking a 15-minute break for a lunch break when the company told him that he should not have any more breaks. The court found that the employer's requirements were reasonable and had been made known to the plaintiff. The plaintiffs had been routinely violating company rules regarding breaks, and the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. The Court awarded the plaintiff$18,000 as damages for his wrongful dismissal. The amount of damages was reduced to $1,000 due to the breach of the company policy. The claim of excessive overtime was dismissed. The evidence showed that the defendant had not been aware of the problem for some time. The fact that the plaintiffs had taken longer breaks during their work day did not help. The action was dismissed without notice."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The estate applied for party and party costs in relation to a claim for costs against the father who sought party and partner costs. The father sought party/party costs. He sought party & party costs. In light of the present position of the Hand and his daughter, and the determination not to order costs in favour of the father, those three parties will bear their own costs. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation' as the father had claimed. It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his mother's will and she clearly made a gift to him that failed. However, the father and his sister were now acting on their own. The issue was not the father requiring to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son. The application wasn't estate litigation either. Alternatively, he sought party costs out of the estate."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The Court ordered that none of the parties should receive costs. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.  1) The Court accepted the defence of the defendants in qualified privilege (that is, that they had publicly communicated the plaintiff's allegations to all members of the Union and were not trying to prevent or to prevent the harassment); 2) The plaintiff has proven that his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. However, the defendants have accepted the plaintiff' defence in qualified privileged (that they had not tried to prevent and were trying to ensure that the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment free workplace); 3) The court accepted the defendant's defence of 'unfounded and without substance' (see: 'all matters which are in accordance with the recognised and reasonable procedure of a tribunal are also absolutely privileged'. The Court held that the impugned wording was all the more troubling because the plaintiff sincerely believed that he, the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment-free workplace, was being sought. The words of the grievance were published in the newspaper, on the Internet, in the file cabinets of the university, in various venues and on the website of the plaintiff and his employer."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The accused had been drinking alcohol and was in the wrong lane when he hit a pedestrian. He was given a two-year conditional sentence. The Crown suggested a range of sentences, from the low end of the range to a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months.

The Court was also concerned with his failure to pay attention to the accident scene."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants asked that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1), of The Queen’s Bench Rules and the Court’S inherent jurisdiction for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and a finding of liability, and an inquiry into damages and profits. The plaintiff was awarded the requested order to strike portions of the plaintiff’ s claim and certain paragraphs pertaining to the breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. HELD: 1) The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertained to the plaintiffs. The defendant’ and plaintiff”s counterclaims to the damages claim were material facts relevant to the plaintiff and to its claim of breach of the fiduciaries duty and breaches of contract, and they were properly pled.  2) The defendants were granted their application to have the plaintiffs claim severed so that the threshold issues of damages could be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages. 3) The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the plaintiff was entitled to the privilege to sue for the disgorgement of profits and that the privilege of disclosure would seriously prejudice the defendants. 4) The Court found no order as to costs."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit and had been a member for 10 years. He testified that he monitored a number of file sharing networks, including one used by the accused, for the purposes of a search warrant. The ICE Unit was involved and the accused was detained. The Court found that the Internet Childexploitation unit was involved, as was the residence of the accused. The residence was searched and the ICE team entered the residence at 12:13 p.m. on October 15, 2014. During that time, the Internet child Exploitations Unit was also involved. The first officer testified that the accused downloaded Shareaza on his computer, connected to the internet, searched for and found vile child abuse videos, downloaded the files and shared them with the world. The second officer testified as to how the system could have been able to identify the packets of information. The third officer testified through his ICE program that he could not locate the accused because the home was often used as a base for the sharing of files. The officer testified on the Internet that he was unable to locate the person who, when contacted by the Internet, would suggest that the person was trying to access the Internet through a shared computer. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex and the Court found the accused had in his possession child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The Internet Child Explorer Unit was used to search the premises. The court found that most of the time, when the accused visited the residence, he was using a computer, which was a computer with an internal IP address, which allowed him to access files from the Internet. The internet connection between the residence and the Internet was also an important connection for the Internet to be navigated. The fact that the residence was often occupied by someone who was viewing files from a third party and could not be reached by the internet connection, and that the internet was a bridge between the Internet and the home, which facilitated the transmission of messages, created an impression of openness and discovery of child abuse, and facilitated the viewing of child porn. The arrest was made on a warrant issued for the accused's viewing of a third-party file sharing network (IPNA). The warrant authorized a search of a second-floor apartment. The evidence showed that the home had a large amount of Internet Protocol (IPA) addresses, which could be used to access a third computer, and a"
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. He is making mortgage payments and selling Pampered Chef products. Following separation, the petitioner was working part-time and living with the respondent. He recently stopped paying the utilities. The respondent is a full time educational assistant who worked part- time. The parties agree that the parties agree the meeting is without prejudice. The only issue which the court could determine was spousal support. HELD: 1) The respondent was entitled to spousals in the amount of $500 per month. The Court ordered that spousAL support be paid in installments of $1,200 per month and child support of $527 per month, plus costs of the mortgage and child care expenses. The court ordered that the spousas be paid at a rate of $36 per month for child care, on an interim basis, and on a full-time basis. 2) The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. There was a need and ability to pay. 3) The parties had three children, three of whom were in a shared parenting arrangement. The mother was working full- time and living living with her husband. The father was making mortgage payment and paying utilities. Monthly cashflow from the mother was $1 million. Monthly SSAG was $600. The two parties did not reach an agreement on any issues. The SSAGs were after income tax, CPP and EI premiums. If the division of family property had not been settled by June 27/2013, either party may seek to have the issue of continued possession of the family home reviewed upon 14 days notice. 4) The court was satisfied that the respondent had reached a consensus on seven issues. It was premature at this point to make any determination as to whether the respondent remains under employed. Whether the respondent should be employed 40 hours per week year round is an issue which will be left to the pre-trial conference."

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appealed a jury trial decision which limited the amount of damages awarded to her. The defendant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the plaintiff's testimony. Awarding damages in the amount $409,251.18, that (1) the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury; (2) the evidence was so extensive as to be impossible to assess without involving experts; (3) the judge's finding of future loss of income was so high that it was perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable; (4) the court rejected the appellant's challenge to the 'future loss of earnings' component in the figure of $337,130.00."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the problem by arbitration. The landlord challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to award damages, claiming that the award was patently unreasonable. The tenant sought to quash the award on the basis that the arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause, which was not patently unfair. The arbitrator was appointed to deal with disputes between the Landlord and Tenant under the lease, apply the principles of waiver and estoppel against the landlord and award damages. The tenants sought to have the award quashed. The issues were: 1) whether the arbitration was a limitation of jurisdiction; 2) was the arbitrators jurisdiction immune from judicial review; 3) was it patently reasonable to award such damages based on the interpretation of the clauses of the lease; and 4) whether estoppels were applicable. The arbitration clause in both the Landlords and Tenants leases was a restricted arbitration clause which allowed the court to deal directly with the issues before the arbiter. The decision of the Landowner was not subject to judicial review but rather to a review by the arbitration tribunal. The Landlord/Tenant lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. The dispute between the landlords and the tenant was between the parties' interpretation of a clause in the lease and involved a dispute about insurance coverage and whether insurance should be covered. The disputes were with respect to the provisions of the clause. The award would have to be quashed but the arbitratedrator was awarded damages."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The law firm had established a procedure to ensure that no disclosure of confidential information would occur between a lawyer and client. The lawyer had worked on both files for the previous spouse and had not had any contact with them prior to her employment. The new law firm instituted a procedure that ensured that no unauthorized disclosure of information would take place between the lawyer and her clients. The screening measures were stringent and there was no risk of disclosure. The applicant's assistant had not been advised of the screening measures, nor had she had any access to the files. HELD: The applicant was found not in a conflict of Interest. The evidence filed by the applicant was that all the screening steps were taken to ensure no disclosure would occur, and that no one would be prejudiced if the Zinkhan, Ms. Quaroni and Ms. Krueger law firm continued to act so long as the screen was in place. There was no evidence that the applicant's lawyer had any involvement with the two files at all.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as well as with operating vehicles while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it a violation of the accused's rights. The officer did have reasonable ground to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. The Court held that the admission of evidence would do no harm. The issue was whether the officer had reasonable grounds as he made the demand, based on observations and information in the possession of the officer, to make the demand for samples. HOLD: The officer was subjectively believed that he had reasonable ground. He did not make any observations indicative of impaired driving, there was no smell of alcohol or admission of consumption of beverage alcohol, the officer's method of collection was relatively non-intrusive and the Certificate of Analysis was excluded. The admission would not affect the administration's ability to operate as a result of the impaired driving. The only question to be determined was whether there was a breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Code and whether the admission would bring the Administration of justiceinto disreputability. The Crown took the position that the officer made observations indicative impaired driving but there was insufficient evidence to establish that the impairment was the result by alcohol. The Certificate of Analyses was excluded as a matter of course."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant appealed the adjudicator's decision to award the appellant $1,500 in lieu of proper notice of termination. The appellant argued that the adjudicating judge erred in law in finding that the respondent had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract and that the appellant had not exceeded his jurisdiction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. The adjudicator did not examine the respondent's company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the respondent and her employees (which seems likely) and the only efforts by the employer were to ask the franchisor whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchising company. 2)The respondent's president did not at any time examine his company's leased (which was regrettably not produced at the hearing) with the franchisesor/Zellerers in orderto determine whether rights of accessing and eress were guaranteed by the respondent. This did not appear to be sufficient evidence to show that the employer, as the appellant's employer, was incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 3)The Court found that the third ground of appeal, patently unreasonable, could not be said to be patently unreasonably unreasonable because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same. The appeal based on the submission that the the adjudication erred (but not arrested) by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated by the appellant and her conduct was dismissed. 4)The second ground of appealed based on an adjudicator exceeding his jurisdiction also failed. The Court found the adjudicators acted well within his jurisdiction in determining what the terms of the respondent Kovach's employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled its obligations thereunder. The decision outlined some evidence upon which he might have arrived at his conclusions."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant doctor who treated the appellant three days after he underwent a circumcision on him declined to answer the interrogatories he had previously objected to on the basis that it required an opinion. He argued that the chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the physician was a subsequently treating physician even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. The respondent, who did not attend the hearing, indicated by letter that he supports the appellant's position that the appellant was a 'later treating physician' to him. The issue on appeal was whether the opinions sought by the interrogatory respondents were opinions which CPR 19 required be provided to the doctor. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part. The chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the appellant a court expert and refusing to order the appellant to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician. The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert’s opinion is clear to the trier of fact who will have to assess the weight to give the opinion taking into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the trienter of fact discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. To allow interrogatories to be used to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  Leave to Appeal was allowed and the appellant’ s appeal was permitted in part as provided for in the decision of Roscoe, J.A., Roscoe and Cromwell, JJ.A. concurring. The order was not made lightly. The exception to this was that the doctor was required to answer interrogatories that required his opinion, even if this involved reviewing information from other sources, including his opinion on the relevant standard of care, whether it was breached by the applicant and whether the appellant suffered damage as a result of the breach. The doctor was not required to re-answer the interrogator questions he previously objected about whether he had received complete circumcision.

The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7(1)(a)(i) of The Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930 did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with a search light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, the Sparrow test, and the safety purpose of the legislation. 2)The appellant had failed to show any error in law. The trial judge did not refer to the Sparrow tests as an error in Law. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement of the appellant's right and, if so, whether it was justifiable. 3)The objective was primarally safety and it was prima fide infringement of aboriginal rights. The question was whether s.11.1 was a legitimate regulatory exercise and whether s11.2(3)(a) was justified. 4)The court was unable to accept the appellation's argument that the accused were Indians under the meaning s.7(a)(ii) of that Act, 1930 and preferred as a community to hunt in the night with artificial lights. The evidence did not show that the appellant were Indians within the Meaning of s7(1) of s3 of the Constitution Act, nor did it show that they had an Aboriginal or Treaty right to hunted at night. The appeal could not be reversed on appeal."
e_2004skqb401.txt,FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated. 1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. 2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002. No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.,"FIAT. This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application was that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. The defendant deposed that he received a registered letter on or about March 16, 2004. It was my belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail did not constitute proper service as required by the Queen'sBench Rules. As such did not take any steps to defend the action believing that proper personal service would be made on me. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. The relevant provisions of Rule 18 require that the applicant receive a copy of the notice of the default and validate the earlier service upon the defendant be registered mail. 1) The application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances under which the default arose and disclosing a defence on the merits. It is not sufficient to merely state that the defendant has good defence upon the merits; the affidavits must show the nature of the defence and set forth facts which will enable the court or judge to decide whether or not there was a matter which would afford defence to the action. Any delay in making the application must be explained. 2) The applicant has not received a copy nor has he considered the earlier notice of service. 3) The plaintiff is entitled to the taxable costs of the Application."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The landlord self-represented against the landlord on the basis that the landlord allowed mould to develop in her basement, failed to rectify the problem, and ruined her belongings. The applicant paid the sum of $787.50 against the landlords' expense. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and the applicant appealed. The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. The landlord's claim was entirely based on the bylaw inspector's findings and he detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould. The tenant's position was that the Tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. She questioned why if there was mould that only affected the Tenants furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. HELD: The two competing versions were rejected. The plaintiff's claim for damages was essentially rejected. Although the director discounted the property damage claims on the ground that the furniture's value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items, she allowed the damages a little higher. She allowed the sum to be paid to the applicant. The damages were revised to reflect the higher cost of the furniture. The Court rejected the landlord's defence that the bylaws inspector was not a reliable source of information and it was impossible to believe he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The Tenant's position that the tenant used grey paint to look mould was impossible. Having heard and assessed the applicant as credible, it was hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic. The only conclusion that could be made was that she was not credible on the general evidence and her claim for general damages was entirely speculative."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased was survived by her two children. SGI applied for a review of the decision as provided by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, which gave the same results as the one for her two surviving children. The deceased took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the deceased's net income rather than on his gross income. The respondent appealed the decision. HELD: The respondent's decision is set aside and SGI is directed to recalculate and pay the deceased the death benefits as per the directions of this Court. 1)The deceased's application is not the same as the income replacement benefit of s.146(1) of the Act. The difference is that the death Benefit is 50% of the deceased\'s actual gross yearly employment income. 2)SGI has calculated the payment based on percentage of her late husband's net incomes rather than his gross incomes. The ordinary meaning of this is that she has received benefit less than the Act contemplates. 3)The only income replacement benefits that the Act could refer to is that provided by s.136. The meaning of the phrase 'income replacement benefit' is different than that referred to in s. 146(1). The death benefit is one-half the 'incomereplacement benefit' in Division 4. The purpose of this payment is to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender. HELD: The tender was awarded to another tenderer who had better experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. The defendant did not check the log books of any of the planes he investigated because he testified it was not common practice to do so and would have given him little relevant information on the operational viability of the plane. The court found the plaintiff used reliable independent sources for its information in order to obtain the lowest bid for the project. The implied term of fairness and privilege clauses are compatible and can co-exist. The person who invites the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of the tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract. HOLD: The action was dismissed. The claim of unfair advantage was dismissed with costs. 1)An implied term to fairness and the privilege clause are compatible. The tendering system would be unworkable without the implied term fairness and there would be no tender system and no tenders to accept. 2)Curniski used reliable sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant, which had the effect of relieving the defendant from accepting the lowest, but such a clause does not entitle the defendant to disregard its obligation to treat all tendererers fairly—because without the express term of fair and impartiality there would not be tender system. 3)The implied term was fairness and could co-expire with the privilege clauses. The former entitles the defendant not to check the logs books of the aircraft he investigated (because he testified he testified in the circumstances he did so and it would have gave him little irrelevant information onthe operational viability). 4)The tender package had the usual privileges clause which had a negative report on the tenderer but had the affect of reliering the defendant of accepting the lower tender."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. H.H. was the mother of the children. Although the father was represented, H.C. was not. The mother was concerned about the father's failure to follow through with parenting services and noncompliance with the parenting services. Both children were in care for most of their lives. The Ministry asked a sixmonth order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father immediately. The order should be made for the purpose of allowing him to make decisions regarding the care of the two young children. The father was to continue living with the mother and take anger management courses and take courses on safe food handling and cooking. The evidence showed that the father had 16 youth offences as youth. The convictions for failure to comply with parenting service and failure to provide drug screen results were both obtained as a result of the father failing to follow up with the parents. The issues before the Court were the appropriate issues to be dealt with in relation to the permanency committee and the children and their mother."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is A repeat violent offender who is still serving his sentence for a sexual assault conviction and out of a weekend pass when his last assault offence occurred. He is a high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit a serious personal injury offence are reasonable. The only issue to be determined is whether that objective person agrees with the accused's subjective belief that RN.s. will re- offend. The officer testified that she has worked with the Correctional Service of Canada at the Federal Penitentiary for 19 years and has had plenty of experience supervising inmates while institutionalized. She also testified that there were three escapes from lawful custody during his time in custody, one of which was in the bush and one in which she was injured. The other was in hospital and she testified that although she had had some counselling, she had not been able to assess whether it was appropriate to exercise caution. The judge found that the accused was at high risk of re- offending and that given the extensive past record of his, the Court was unable to make generality of that sort of evidence. The court found that it was impossible for the accused to have reasonable grounds to believe that he would commit a sexual offence and that his reasons for refusing to exercise them were reasonable. It was also impossible for him to refuse a conditional release on the conviction on the other convictions. The evidence that he had not taken any Aboriginal programming during his incarceration was unreliable and was accorded little weight in the balanced judicial consideration. The administration of justice was also of concern as the accused had a history of violent offending and had spent much of his time and effort in the penitentiary. The fact that the administration of the programming was discontinued due to lack of supervision by the probation officer and the parole officer was of concern because of her assessment of his risk to offend again."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. The Court was unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentencing must be dismissed. The accused's state of mind at the time the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated him from responsibility for them. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)Since the accused was fully and fairly put, it cannot be said that you did not have a fair trial. 2)Since his defence was fully put to the jury, the Court could not accept it. 3)The sentence was fit to sentence."

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. or Dow Corring Corporation. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. She suffered from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The statement of claim alleged negligence by the defendants, including a failure to disclose a risk to her that was discovered only in 1994. The defendant denied the allegations and asserted that the plaintiffs condition was caused by negligence attributed to the defendants. HELD: The statement was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause. 1)The defendant was at law responsible for the liabilities of the Dow Chemical Company. The Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason other than a causal connection, although any uncertainty or doubt was to be resolved in favour of the defendant. 2)The plaintiff was assuming that her condition was a result of negligence attributed solely to the defendant, Dow Chemical, and not the other defendants. The pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendant and the plaintiff. There is a causal relationship between the corporate veil and the plaintiffs damages. 3)Dow Chemical was served with the Statement of Claim in this action at its offices in Midland, Michigan. 4)DOW Chemical did not now nor has it ever carried on business within the Province of Saskatchewan, has no assets nor employees located within the province of Saskatchewan and is not licensed nor registered to carry on business here."
d_1999canlii12779.txt,"The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. The bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and had no dependants. He was a self-employed contractor and had an enviable income. HELD: There would be an order requiring the bankrupt to pay to the trustee the sum of $18,000.00 for distribution to the unsecrated creditors. 1)The bankrupt could accommodate a payment of $500.00 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. 2)The trustee calculated surplus income of $435.00 and requested a conditional order requiring payment of the sum $7800.00. Judgement interest would accrue on any payment in arrears. The right of prepayment was denied. 3)During the term of the conditional order the bankrupt was required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax, G.s.T and G.T filing requirements. 4)The court carefully reviewed the financial material on file and considered the submissions of the parties. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. The bankruptcy had a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations which stretches back at least 15 years. Not only does the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also does not file his returns. The unemployed contractor is 43 years of age, in health and has no dependents. He is a self employed contractor and has an envious income. The only issue at the discharge hearing was the determination of the amount of surplus income available to pay. The trustee calculated a surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional ordering requiring the payment of money in the amount $78000. It would take approximately 18 months to complete the terms of the order. The objecting creditor calculated surplus in excess of $750.00 ($750) and requested monthly payments of this sum. 5)The judge found the bankrupt could safely accommodate a monthly payment of about $500 for three year without jeopardising his ability or ability to contribute to his current taxes obligations. He would be entitled to costs of $400 out of the estate."

Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined. Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York.

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The severance packages he received were based on 20.4 months of future earnings. If the severance pay is additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship. If it is an additional remittance given as reward for previous service, then it should not be shareABLE. 2)The judge was of the view that the severances package was based on 19.4 Months of future wages.

The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. The claims claim that the plaintiffs were misled and misled by the defendants' misleading and deceptive advertising. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim, because the facts are not disputed and the determination of a single legal issue will decide whether the plaintiffs have a tenable cause of action. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff's affidavit was examined and the dates and times of the certification hearing were determined. The court reviewed the expert evidence and found that: 1) the defendants acknowledge that they have put identical products on the market but labelled these identical products differently. 2) the facts were undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 3) While there may be a genuine issue for trial, the Court was not comfortable with determining the defendants's summary judgment application prior to deciding the plaintiffs' application for certification."

They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff and his wife sought the return of a substantial amount of money from the defendant corporation for the plaintiff's counterclaim.

The defendants had purchased the land from the plaintiff and intended to construct a mixed residential and commercial building. The plaintiffs were frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. The Defendant corporation sought payment of the plaintiff for the monies it had already paid and claimed damages for misaviation of the monied profits it had received from the defendants. The counterclaim was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff failed to prove the claim on a balance of probabilities. The contract was frustrated and the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the defendant wife 35% of loss.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant appealed its conviction for selling tobacco to a youth contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. As for the federal legislation, it has been assumed by both parties that it is in pith and Substance criminal law as decided in relation to its predecessor statute by majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v.

He was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level (BAC) after trial. The Crown appealed on the ground the trial judge erred in finding the appellant had reasonable and probable grounds for the breathalyzer demand, and that he was being arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that the C.C.'s Law Enforcement Training Centre (LITC) was a model city and the LITC training centre was a success. The LITCA was a proven ground for the LERT test and the breath sample was twice as effective. The C.A.A.'s conviction was quashed on the basis that the trial court erred by failing to consider s. 8. The flexible approach to the appeal was used in view of the fact that the respondent was not a free-rider but a citizen. It was not necessary to double-check the breath readings in order to obtain a breath sample. The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of s.9. The focus of inquiry was on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether to give the breath test. While the police officer's actions were not random, they were demonstrably in violation of s.(9) of the charter. The refusal to comply with the breath demand could result in an erroneous 'fail' which would constitute a breach of s(8) of s8. The unreasonable detention and deprivation of rights enjoyed by a free and democratic society was demonstrably justified."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario.

While the Court has great sympathy for the family in not being able to attend all of the trial for personal reasons, it has serious concerns about the ramifications to the administration of justice. This is a dangerous situation and the court was not prepared to accept the applicant's argument that a courtroom across the street from where only the family would be in attendance is just an extension of the courtroom in Saskatchewan, it is a distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no jurisdiction or control.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault or whether she should be convicted for one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assaulted. The court found that the accused was guilty of mischief. The Court of Appeal stated that the Crown had not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Code. As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaskowski, the Court of Queen's Bench referred to the intent required for various assault provisions. Hears from the evidence, that the defendant intentionally damaged the complainant's eye area and significant bruising following the incident. The evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused is guilty of aggravated assaulting. The inescapable conclusion is that the Fayant struck the complainant in the facial area with the candle holder. The injuries were inflicted by a single backhanded blow.

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The issue was whether the Stewards from other jurisdictions were entitled to notice of the hearing. The applicants applied to have the hearing quashed on the basis that the hearing was patently unreasonable. Application allowed; the hearing is to be held on the issue of whether the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction; whether the decision was pathetically unreasonable; whether there was error on the face of the record; whether this was an error on its face; whether it was patrimony on the evidence. The court found that the tribunal whose decision was under review had failed to inquire into certain evidence and had made incorrect factual findings, and whether there had been error on that face. It concluded that the jurisdiction was immune from review by the superior courts unless there was an unreasonable error on their face."

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code.

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced a rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for rectification was dismissed. The court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events. The defendant knew the price for the RTM did not come with a basement and there was no agreement reached between the parties to pay interest. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the Court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached."
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2)The injunctions were imposed on the respondent employees for breach of contract and non-solicitation agreements. 3)The respondent employees were not entitled to advertising their availability to the market or otherwise making known that they had joined Danka Canada Inc. (Danka). 4)The application was stayed pending trial. 5)The plaintiff failed to establish a primari facie ground of imminent danger of substantial damage.  6)The affidavits filed by the respondent employee allude to the existence of a confidentiality agreement between Danka and Brennan. The affidavits provide no evidence of competition or solicitation nor of threats of violence. The respondent did not obstruct or impede the unlawful activity of the respondents as it was alleged in its memorandum of agreement. 7)The court found that Danka had not established a primi facie grounds of imminent threat of substantial harm. It was also found that the respondent had not demonstrated a primamitas case or a serious issues of substantial damages."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information put forward by the respondent on which to direct an assessment of six years of legal services was not reliable and there were no properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the applicant. The respondent was correct in concluding that the period of non-payment was within the 30 day time period provided by s. 67 of the Act. The application should have been extended. The applicant was not disadvantaged in that the respondent's request was based on fact, rather than conjecture, as was the case in many other recent applications. The fact that the applicant had not taken the opportunity to assess her billings during this time period was not a reason to extend the time for the assessment."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was at his residence on a Friday night. She also claimed that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. The trial judge found that the complainant's testimony was consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. He ruled that the evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by a social worker as to the psychological and physical conditions that frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of a child, was admissible. The appeal was dismissed. Allowing the appeal and concluding that the verdict was one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered, did not excuse the appellant."

Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who was convicted of theft, drove to the Canada-U.S. border station and was arrested by border guards after he pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000. The appellant had been previously sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month probation period. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate. The evidence provided by the appellant in the affidavit did not provide the court with the information it would normally receive. The fact that the respondent's father had written an affidavit before the Court indicating that he had been assessed by the probation officer prior to his release did not help. The Court of Appeal held that the failure to provide sufficient information to the probation judge was in breach of s.334 of the Criminal Code."

9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.",The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner;(b)rests the respondent from releasing any monied monies that he has received in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No.2270/97 pending the petitioner's application or further court order; and(c)restrorbs the respondent of disposing of any of the monies he has already received in connection to the action pending the respondent.HELD: The respondent was granted an ex-parte order set aside pursuant to s. 7 of the Family Maintenance act which: (a) restrains all monies received by the respondent pursuant to the Action or any claim against the Attorney general of Canada pending the applicant's application; (b) restrorbs all monying that the respondent has received or may receive in relation thereto; and (c) restrieves the respondent with any monying received in any event pursuant to this action pending his application or any court order.

In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The mother, who had been the sole borrower of the family's Federal Plus loans, applied for a variation of the corollary relief in her application. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order, both designed to cover the mother's past educational costs. Application to strike out the father's application dismissed; the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollo relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The father had paid child support in the amount of $14,800 per year for the past four years and the amount owed to the mother was part of the amount owing to the federal Plus loans. The mother had secured several loans to pay for the daughter's education. The only source of support for the family was from the Federal Plus loan. The daughter had completed high school and was working towards university education. Application dismissed; there was no evidence the loans were secured for the purpose of paying for the child's education; nor was there evidence the mother declared they were loans. There was no indication the loans had materially increased since the mother had made them available to her. The family had been unable to pay any of the outstanding debts and the father was responsible for the payments for the oldest daughter's college education.

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made an issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for a trial to determine the will in viva voce form. 2) The test in Quaintance is based on a rebuttable presumption. Where there is an evidentiary burden on a witness, it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuine issues to be tried, such as lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence or lack of mental capacity. 3) The court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. The Court found that it was appropriate to review the authorities because of the conflicting accounts of the parties. 4) The evidence did not support the idea that a trial was warranted. The evidence was found to be inconsistent and unreliable. 5) The Act did not provide an evidential burden on the witness."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance for approximately 5 years. His application was terminated due to failure to disclose requested information. In 2006 he re-applied for income assistance but was denied on the basis that he failed to provide requested information (the Appeal Board had found that the applicant was a person in need). The applicant appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board. The Board allowed the appeal and found that applicant was 'a person in Need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act. The board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date he was assessed. The application for an order under mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. The respondent had a duty to act pursuant to the regulations and had no discretion to make decisions which were not binding generally or as to the time period effected. If the respondent had the right to ignore decisions of the Board, the Appeal board's function would be meaningless."

The respondent was directed not to remove any of the children near the matrimonial home and to provide relief to the third parties by freezing the funds until the judgment was issued. The applicant had secured employment in Medicine Hat, moved to Medicine Hat with the understanding that she would be permitted to move with the children, and paid rent.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied and the decision ought not be overturned. 2)The court was not compelled to accept the expert's opinion, the evidence was conclusive that the respondent had sufficient interest, the Law was correctly apply and the court's decision ought to be overturned, as there was conflicting evidence to the contrary. 3)The respondent had no financial burden. Given the comment of counsel for the respondent, he was not looking to the appellant to pay costs but that an award of costs may assist."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act,1997. HELD: 1) The Court found that the applicant had not established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. It was also found that there was no evidence to support the respondent's position that he stood in a loco parental role. 2) The respondent paid the petitioner the sum of $1,500 per month for eight months. Given the short-term relationship and the fact that the petitioner lived with the respondent for most of the time, this would relieve her of any economic hardship. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $1 per month because the Court was determining the appropriate amount of interim spousal support. 3) The issue of the respondent standing in locus parentis was resolved. The respondent was found to be in locum parentis. The petitioner was found in need of some financial assistance in the short term. The court ordered the petitioner pay $2,349 as spousals for a total of eight months to allow her to reassess her situation. The parties' income and the length of their marriage did not appear to be approaching the point of collapse where a spousary would be appropriate. The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. The issues are the appropriate length of time and the appropriate Amount of spousa support should be paid to the petitioner."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of her death. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits under s146(5). The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits were available under s145(5)? HELD:[1] Section 147 of the Act does not assist the surviving spouse in determining what the minimum death benefit is and where, as here, the surviving spouses death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427 and the formula used in s146 is $54,854. Where, however, no benefit other than the minimum Death Benefit of $45,000 is payable, no further amount is payable. The income replacement benefit, in this case, is zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s146 or s146 has 5."

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.

The plaintiff and the defendants who have status in the proceedings, the defendants and the board of directors of 607, authorized the initiation of a derivative action by the defendant. By decree of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiatory initiation of the action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 6500. By May 27 2004, the fiat of Gereinn C. J. was ruled that the defendants were entitled in the name of the plaintiff 609 and that the plaintiff was obliged, pursuant to Henry, to appoint the counsel for 609.

Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the application, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609 which is self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 that is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. 2) As only a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry was empowered and compelled to appoint a counsel for that purpose and is obliged to instruct 609's counsel. Whether the counsel is a lawyer appointed by the plaintiff or Henry 609 or someone else is entirely for Henry, issues of disclosure, privilege and reporting as raised by the above questions are capable of resolution utilizing analogous proceedings without doing violence to fundamental principles in the litigation process. 3) As the nature of the act is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 608 as Henry is obliged, as he is obliged in the corporate interests in the derivative, or does it extend further? 4) Whether that lawyer is Mr./Brehon, a member of the insurer or someone other than that firm was entirely matter to Henry.

d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005 had been a basis for the search. The applicant alleged that these documents were found at his residence and in any storage facilities occupied by the applicant. The affidavit filed by the accountant alleged that he filed fraudulent tax returns for the same reason. The application sought the disqualification of the provincial court judge from hearing his trial on the basis of an apprehension of bias. The issues were as follows: 1) there was insufficient candor to justify the search; 2) the factual material presented by the affidavit was incomplete and misleading; 3) the respondent's evidence did not support the inference that he would not have pursued a search without the affidavit. The officer's evidence supports the inference, based on the fact that he had previously acted judicially, given the information provided by the informant, that he could not have proceeded without the paragraphs; and 4) there were no reasonable and probable grounds to search the applicant's premises. The search warrant was invalid. The documents were discovered at the residence and were subsequently returned to the applicant by the respondent. The respondent did not say that he wished to have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he was more comfortable omitting information that he now knew to be erroneous. The judge's own evidence supports an inference that the search warrant, which was not automatically removed, was not justified. The fact that the affidavit contained errors and misleading information did not rise above the level of'suspicion' which could be considered reasonable and likely grounds for a warrant to search his premises."

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.",The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine. The plaintiff also claims damages for breachof an employment contract when the plaintiff employed Sullivan as a manager. Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff at the plaintiff company at the time of the contract but was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS. The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiffs for two months in February 2005 for term of two months. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September 2005. The plaintiffs sued Sullivan for breach. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The court found that the trial judge erred in finding that Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. The trial judge did not find any case law on point in this province and awarded the plaintiff $500 rather than the $500 award. The issue is whether Sullivan breached the duty of good faith. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The employer prepared his bid for the contract based on information she had obtained over the years simply by virtue of being in the business. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife when he was off work.

The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.

The accused blew a test on the approved screening device and was taken to the RCMP detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all charges. The removal of the accused's cell phone from his vehicle does give pause for thought in that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. The officer was justified in assuming that he was satisfied. 1)There was no breach of the defence's right to counsel. The absence of the cell phone and the subsequent destruction of video evidence did not breach the accuseds rights to counsel as they were with respect to the destruction of the video evidence. 2)The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest he wanted to consult another lawyer. Accordingly, the officer was rational in assuming he was content. 3)The destruction of vial evidence did have no relevance to the accused in making his full answer and defence.  4)The evidence was clean and the accused did have a reasonable chance of making a full answer to the Court. The evidence was not dumb or incapable of concealing the fact that the defence was not seeking to find the source of the evidence or to find out the law's relevance or relevance to making full answer or defence."

The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who believed there were dead tuna in a tuna pen. He used diving equipment borrowed from the defendant and another individual who was not present on the day of the accident. After a medical examination, it was determined that he died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. The defendant was a 'dependent contractor' under s.(1)(c) of The Occupational Safety and Health Act, meaning he was required to perform duties mainly for the defendant, perform duties mostly for him and was in a relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of independent contractor. The facts did not establish that he was dependent on the defendant for his livelihood, but the Crown did establish that, as a self employed fisherman, he was entitled to an equal share of the profit he earned for his work."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property pursuant to the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. The past 3 years, the petitioner had owned several machines and this began before the marriage. However, there is a variance in the opinions of the experts. 2) The respondent sold his tractor and the proceeds were to purchase an acreaged farm land which he now claims is family property. 3) The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. She should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court declined to take them into account. 4) The debts submitted by the respondent were referred to three appraisals. One was done at the behest of the petitioner and two for the respondent. The other was done by the petitioner. The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 5) The machinery was divided equally. The father owned a tractor prior to the marriage which was acquired prior to marriage. He did not sell it. The farm equipment was owned by the father. The Court did not accept the father's testimony that he owned the tractor prior thereto. The amount of machinery which was subject to the three appraises was reduced to $800. The court did not take into account the amount owing to the father of the tractor. The appellant had received no benefits from these activities. Therefore, she should bear the responsibility for them. The balance sheet of the respondent's vehicle was examined and the value of the tools was fixed at $2,000. The three appraisers did not consider the tractor to be family property as it was owned in part by the appellant. The interest earned would not be exempt but the interest earned was. The home was valued at $856. The respondents could not be heard to say they owned the vehicle prior to this marriage. The proceeds of the farm equipment were included in the distribution."

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of an order for spousal support in the amount of $10,000 per month, staying the execution of a previous order for which the appellant had been in arrears. The appellant argues that the Chambers judge's conclusion that he stopped paying the bills for the family home at the end of October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him and that the appellant may be prejudiced by the imposition of the stay because the appellant is paying ongoing spousals and is in arreaars. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceeding is allowed. It is understood that the judge's decision on the Chambers judgment was not based on the evidence presented but on the fact that the respondent had made significant payments with respect to the family house in the interim order. The Court of Appeal rules provide that the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution for spouse support. The judge has the power to give directions with respectto staying proceedings."

There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree in Accounting. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing price of $120,000). The defendant Border Credit Union opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Goetz. The judicial sale, in the circumstances of this case, was not realistic. The applicant was not entitled, in these proceedings, to a possession order. The property was owned by the registered owners and was subject to the foreclosure proceedings for six months. The application to apply for a final order of foreclosure was dismissed as it was not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement."

The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until further order. The court granted the application for an interim order and certain conditions including restraining such persons from picketing and from interfering with the lawful operation of the applicant's utilities and services. The applicant also sought orders restraining certain persons from obstructing or blocking the places of entrance to and egress from various sites of operation of his business and to restraining such individuals from trespassing on the premises of his premises. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until trial.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. The trial judge found the respondent had in his truck used for the purposes of trafficking, which was a commercial operation. The Crown sought forfeiture of that truck, arguing the impact of a forfeiture on the immediate family of the person charged with the offence and the fact that the respondent is a first-time offender. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. 1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. The guilty plea was not proven. 2) It was clear the vehicle was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The judge could take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on the respondent's immediate family, albeit of a small-time nature. He noted the respondent depressed and was remorseful and the father was not entitled to possession of the property. The Court could order forfeiture. 3) It would be unfair to order the forfeiture of this truck used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The conviction was not criminal. The respondent was a first time offender with no previous criminal record. The truck was owned and paid by the respondents and paid through a Loan from his mother. The court found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account to the kid to pay the truck. He found the venture to be commercial one albeit of small-scale nature. The family was not responsible for transporting the respondent to various places across the country. The refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeit of the vehicle by the use of the words'shall...order that the property be forfeited' was a serious issue. The onus is on the sentencing court to find proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture. 4) It has nothing to do with the offences committed.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for workplace stress relief. The appellant appealed on the basis that the tribunal failed to take into account the worker's subjective view of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. Appeal dismissed; the policy is based on the best available evidence and the best view of law available at the time. The policy sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain work related issues, such as personal conflict and ineffective management, which the appellant failed to rebut. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that the policy reflects the law which was in place before 2005. The decision of the Appeal Commissioner was also reviewed for correctness. The appeal was allowed on the ground that the Policy was not based on an objective view of events and was not the result of a policy change. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable and there was uncertainty about the conditions which created the gradual onset stress claim. The court reviewed the history of the policy and found it was not appropriate to refer to workplace events as 'usual and excessive' as in 'disruptive events' or 'disasters of the nature' as defined in the Policy. The respondent Board did not err in considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual and excessive on an objectively objective basis. The objective assessment, as set out in the policy, is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GECA and furthers its overall intent to provide no fault compensation for injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The trial judge found that although the respondent Board erred in the interpretation of the 'accident' (i.e., 'the accident occurred in the workplace and was of significant consequence to the worker in the same or similar occupation) and in failing to give adequate weight to the opinion of the appellant as to the petitioner's treatment psychologist in the absence of evidence to rebuff that opinion, the appellant did not fail to give weight to that opinion in its reasons in this appeal."

When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","The plaintiff insurer, which represented the defendant defendant, failed to disclose the existence of its second insurance policy. The plaintiff insurer sued the defendant insurer, claiming negligence by the defendant in advancing its claim against one insured, Canada Trustco, for non-payment of the insurance premium. The defendant insurer sued both the plaintiff and defendant, claiming breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants both submitted their insurance policies were insuring the plaintiff's interests were not diminished by the loss, as the defendant had insured against the plaintiff’s loss. Awarding the plaintiff $1,000 for the outstanding portion of the unpaid premium, that in order for the plaintiff to have recourse against the defendant, her insurance policy to be paid on the basis of the first policy, the defendant should first have paid the premium himself, and then the plaintiff should have paid on its own. The court reviewed the history of the two insurance policies and found that the plaintiff was not affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the defendant. The Court concluded that the'second policy' represented a significant change in the plaintiff company’ s business model and was therefore appropriate for this case."

The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of a motor Vehicle contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code.

Although his driving was in poor condition and he was in the driver's seat when the breath demand was read, there was little danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public.

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code.

When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss. 253(b) and 255(3) and driving while disqualified contrary so s. 259(4), all of Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The Court found that beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and at all material times, the Court found no evidence to support the Crown's allegation of impairment beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt. The accused is found not guilty of count 2 in the Information."
c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in Bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcies. The Trustee was appointed as Trustee In bankruptcy. The former president of the company retained as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the premises for the creditors. When he attended the premises, he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. The plaintiff sued the corporate landlord, County Realty, for an interim injunction. County Realtor granted the defendant summary judgment. The defendant applied for summary judgment and the action was continued. The issues before the court was that the landlord's distress rights had been lost and he should have known that the current inventory was not reliable. The evidence before the Court was overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist. The mere statement by the defendant that that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issue exists which ought to be tried."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether the plaintiff was constructially dismissed as a result of changes unilaterally made by the defendant in the terms of her employment, and whether there was constructive dismissal. HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last employment with the defendant, plus vacation pay at 6% per annum. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in a relatively short period of time. This was not the case in this case where the defendant made an effort to find a replacement. It was not to suggest that the plaintiff wasn't overpaid for the work that she did. Rather it seems to be due to a dirth of employment opportunities in the Truro area or an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at very modest rate as illustrated by the case of the respondent. 2)The plaintiff has made continuing and diligent efforts to find work. There is absolutely no question that she has been constructively dismissing. However, considering all of the circumstances, an appropriate period is 8 months."" 3)The Court held that it did not require a'short notice period' as in'short period of leave'. It merely required that the employer pay the plaintiff what she was earning at the date of her dismissal. 4)The employer bore the burden of proof in this matter. The Court awarded damages to the respondent on the amount of $924,000 awarded to the plaintiff for breach of contract and prejudgment interest. 5)The respondent was awarded costs of the action. 6)The court found that the respondent had failed to take proper notice of the proposed changes.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in with the mother. She had been in the family home with the children for several years. In the interim, the father, Jake, was in a serious motor vehicle accident. He was hospitalized for a fractured leg, fractured ankle and suffered concussion. The parties' parenting relationship was tumultuous and the children, now aged 11 and 12, had difficulty adjusting to living with the father. The father had bounced from home to home. The boys received minimal direction or discipline, the mother was concerned he was overpaid, the children's school hours were disrupted, the respondent was late picking up the boys, the parties' home was in considerable disrepair and there was mould on the walls, the petitioner's friend was a frequent contributor to the problem and the respondent's employment arrangement was questionable. He had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred. The petitioner was awarded $8,041.86 per month as lump sum payment. The respondent was to assist with renovations to the respondent’s home and the boys’ school attendance was reduced to two weeks. He also received lump sum payments of $836.86."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","HELD: The application was granted. The respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based on an income of $88,808.88. The arrears from 2005 through to 2012 would be adjusted to reflect the difference between the income and arrear of support. The court recognized the respondent's failure to act on the application and found that he had not been able to earn consistent income for several years. The reason for the delay was the respondent’s mental health problems. The Court found that the respondent had not responded well to the application. The applicant had not paid any child support in the amount of $350 per month for the past five years. As the respondent was earning less than he did in 2005, the Court found it necessary to vary the spousal support to reflect a different income. The petitioner had made an assignment into bankruptcy. The decision to vary support was made some time ago. HELD: 1)When dealing with an application to vary, the court must accept the original order was correct at the time it was made and must then determine whether material change has occurred requiring review of the order. The task now is to determine whether the existing order ought to be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income than that imputed in 2005. The Respondent has been content to have the existing ordered in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. In approaching variation, the respondent needs to show material change in circumstances. The ability to vary an interim order has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Prescesky Prescesk. The judge determined that the payor had the ability to pay the arreary and the arreears from 2013 to date will be adjusted accordingly. The reasons for the change in the order, including the fact that the applicant had been in arrearns for several months prior to making the application, are with respect to the respondent and his mental health. 2)The Court found the respondent did not have the ability or the ability (and should therefore be required to) to pay arrearing in the years 2005 through 2012. The fact that he was in arreaars for several of those years did not contribute to the decision. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. The Onus rests on the petitioner to justify this need. The"

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

The arbitrator's award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent.

The Court had determined from a review of the record that the findings of the arbitrationrator with which the appellant takes issue, do not involve questions of law but rather involve questions regarding fact.

Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter.

The accused had made significant strategic decisions regarding the admissibility of the new evidence, including not re-electing a judge by mistake and making a non-binding undertaking to not call evidence until the end of the Crown’s case. She had negotiated with the Crown beforehand to have the statement go in without contest. The Crown had no prior knowledge of this new evidence and no obligation to disclose it. The complainant had made strategic decisions relating to the trial process, including agreeing not to contest the admissible evidence at trial, her agreement to waive her right to a Preliminary Inquiry and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the crown’ s. 8 motion. The trial judge was aware that the accused had been prejudiced. The disclosure of this information can be used to impeach, contradict or otherwise affect the accused’S credibility. The court was satisfied that the complainant had a right to re-election because she had negotiated a confidentiality agreement with the crown prior to the discovery of the evidence. The agreement was voluntary and the accused was entitled to re‑elect. The judge was not satisfied that she should be released from undertakings and agreements reached to date and that she was entitled, on a balance of probabilities, to reelect a judge. The respondent had made important tactical decisions regarding her right and her right not to call evidence at the trial and to remain silent. The breach of her right of re-elected was not intentional. The Court was not able to cure the prejudice of late disclosure to the accused. The decision was fair and balanced, and the trial judge did not commit to reopening the case until after full Crown disclosure had been concluded. The administration of justice was at risk.

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b) of The Farm Land Security Act. In issue was the solicitation of a letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1) The defendant's offer of first- refusal was conditional and unequivocal. It did not require that it be a forwarded letter of a commitment directly from a bank, as that would detract from the fairness of the purchase and from the equity component of the Act and the requirement that the plaintiffs provide a letter to the defendant as required by the legislation. 2) The loan approval issued by the defendant was not an unconditional and unequivococal commitment. The loan approved, in the sense of what the plaintiffs requested, was not conditional or unequivocal in the way it was described in the legislation and was in fact subject to the legislation, conditional and conditional. The plaintiffs had committed themselves to the mortgagee, who as it turned out was not prepared to provide such a letter, and they also incurred liabilities with the mortgage company for loan processing fees and solicitor costs. 3) The plaintiff did not have the benefit of full argument on the point.

As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the petitioner voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The Matrimonial Property Act, s. 275(2nd Supp) allows for joint custody of the children with access to the matristonial home on alternating weekends. The matrimony home is currently operated by the respondent. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint access under s. 16(4) of the Divorce Act. The children's investment arrangements in Canada Savings Bonds and Mutual Funds exist in the children's names in the approximate amount of $2,000.00 each. The petitioner proposes to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the childrens welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the parties to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the young children."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendant medical doctors. He alleged that a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence was impaled on it. He claimed that his right calf had been impaled while he was on the picket. Dismissing the action, that the defendants and their doctors did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs."
2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. The defendant resisted the claim and by way of a counterclaim sought judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1) The plaintiff was not responsible for the initial build-up to the completion of the house. He was only entitled to a credit for the extras which were to be paid on the possession date. 2) The appraiser was not a party to the whole contract. He had no knowledge of the structural problems identified in the drawings. He did not take steps to correct them. 3) The Plaintiff was not owed any of the money owed by the defendant. He paid nothing for extras. 4) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to $4,000 for the total cost of the project. The Court could not find any basis upon which to allow such a claim."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
6_2004skca168.txt,The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,The appellant appealed an order of a Queen's Bench judge directing that the daughter of the parties attend kindergarten during the seven week period before trial. The respondent had previously applied for variation of the order pertaining to the child's access to kindergarten. The appellant appealed on the basis that the order under attack did not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Court of Appeal is all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed. It is not our function to fine tune orders of this nature particularly when they are of such short duration. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion. The order under assault is an attempt to manage the situation for a short period before the trial.
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Widents' relief Act but the petitioner's new spouse applied for an order pursuant to the Wright v. Wright Act. HELD: The child was to be allocated equally with the other child. 1)The evidence showed that the term 'personal effects' did notinclude grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 2)The children were to receive their share of the estate upon attaining the age twenty-five years.  3)The terms of the Will were not to be given anything other than its ordinary meaning with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.  4)The term'motor vehicles' didNotinclude grain or livestock, livestock or other items related to their business or operations of a farm. 5)The respondent's personal effects did not include grain, cattle, farm equipment or furniture or other asset related to his or her business or theoperationsof a farm or the farm equipment."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. Each charge was separately brought with six charges. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against the accused. HELD: The Crown's motion was granted. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867, along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed pursuant in s. 146. It is the Crown's perspective that commercial fishing was not an issue in this case. The acquittalals based on the constitutional defence that are the subject of this appeal are the ones which were apprised of the change in the Crown position. 1)It is the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for food, because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial activities, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purposes. The Court found the Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue. Rather the appeal was limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). 2)It was open to the defence to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to fish for food as opposed to fishing for commercial purpose. The defence counsel was free of malice or devious approach. 3)It would be perverse to deprive our Aboriginal ancestors of a fundamental right to live and fish for their food. The proper characterization is that the offences at trial clearly established that the defendants were engaged in commercial activity. The evidence did not establish that they were hunting for food to feed themselves or their families. Therefore, an Aboriginal rights claim was not made. 4)The acquittles based on a constitutional defence were the ones that were apportioned to the Crown. The first two grounds were raised by defence counsel. The second ground was the Crown did not intend to make the aboriginal rights issue a priority issue. The court found the defence did not intended to make this issue a matter of the constitutional foundation they had established at trial. 5)The Crown did have a duty to provide proper security to the Metis."
d_2010skqb458.txt,"Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439. The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded double party to party costs under Column 3 and double party costs in Column 4. The court reduced the amount of spousal support to $18,000. The reason for the revocation was that the offer was revoked weeks after the completion of the Trial. The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial was found in Queen's Bench Rule 184B and the Rule 184(b) and were implemented in Rule 184."
1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division had set aside the decision in Ripley v. Investment Dealer Association of Nova Scotia and the respondent's application for an order restraining the respondent from further proceeding in respect to charges prosecuted under the constitution and bylaws of the Association. The appellant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances. Application for interim injunction dismissed.  1)The applicant would have satisfied the requirements for an application in Ripleys v. International Cyanamidity test. The test is met in McFetridge v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society and the trial judge imposed an injunction of the type requested now by the respondent in the event he was found guilty in professional misconduct or, in this case, professional misconduct by the applicant. 2)The application for interim injunctive relief was dismissed. 3)The trial judge erred in not allowing the applicant to participate in the tribunal hearing on the basis of apprehension of bias. The applicant was found to have satisfied his requirements in the application for the interim injunction.  4)The appeal court was unable to distinguish the cases. In McFetrendridge v., the trial court found that the application was premature and the court could not interfere in the proceeding of a tribunal hearing."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime. The accused was a student at the time and had gone to the University of Chester where he had a beer. The police observed him leave his car and returned to the wharf. They found a backpack stuffed with cocaine, a knapsack and cash which they placed at his feet. The officers searched the vehicle and found a large amount of cocaine, cash and a large quantity of cocaine. The knapsacks were found in the vehicle console and the driver's seat had a large number of empty beer bottles. The officer testified that he had given the accused a knapack when he left the car and he assumed it was his. The evidence established that the knapsock was in the personal possession of the accused and that, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapacks, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. The cash was found in a bag similar to that found in an open vehicle. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the drugs and money were in the possession of him. HELD: The accused is guilty of all three charges before the Court.  1) The evidence was admissible against the accused. The Court accepted the evidence of the knapping and the knapped hands. It was obvious that he consented and that he controlled the bag and its contents until he left his motor vehicle. It is also obvious that the defendant had control of the bag, the knappers and the cash until he went left the motor vehicle and left the property. It establishes that the cash was in his possession for the lawful purpose of transporting. 2) The knapping was not secured by a lock even though a small lock was attached to the front of the backpack. The defendant had them in his pocket knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.

The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents.

Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency had an application for permanent care of four children. The Agency had previously refused to admit the mother into its care, alleging that she was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining the children. As the children were in need of protective services, the Agency had made a referral to Children's Aid, who were in the process of assessing the children, and they were in a more comfortable location. The mother had since been diagnosed with Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The children had been out of their mother's care for several months, and the father was no longer able to supervise the children due to the mother's poor impulse control, inability to superv supervise and severe cold exposure. The father was to provide psychological and parenting assessment. The child's future plans were uncertain. The agency had made no determinations as to whether the child's current placement with the Agency would be appropriate. The evidence was that the mother was prone to repetitive daily behavior and had developed some form of obsessive compulsive disorder. The assessment report indicated that the child had a mild case of Aspergers's syndrome, which was later diagnosed as an Oppositions Defiant. The family history was reviewed extensively and there was some agreement that the father should be placed on the psychosocial assessment. However, the father's assessment was not based on a consensus view as to the risk to the children caused by the failure of the parent to supervize adequately. The report was also not based upon a consensus opinion. The parents had discussed the possibility of a general costing clause after reviewing the material and having the children move with the mother. The nature of the issue at stake was that of whether the father could parent the children adequately. As long as the parents were able to afford it, the children would be in the permanent care provided to them by the Agency. The Family Skills Worker was accepted as a witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The Child Services Worker was also accepted as capable of providing opinion evidence. The order was adjourned to allow the assessment to be completed. The Children's Services Worker continued to visit the residence approximately every other week. The annual assessment was completed in September 2001 and the children had completed their first trimester of life. The son, who was now aged 12, had recently been diagnosed as having Asperger's. The Assessment report concluded that the parents had been neglectful, and using excessive force and abuse, and that they had suffered from an emotional and physical trauma resulting"

He was remanded until his sentencing, which was scheduled for December 4, 1995. The Crown appealed the conviction on three grounds: 1) the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant by the complainant, without even having heard the contradictory statement; 2) the trial judge failed to permit cross- examination of the complainant on audio/video cassette without even knowing she had heard the second contradictory statement.

It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly.

2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the husband would have interim sole custody. By an agreement in November 1997 the wife was diagnosed with unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar clinical depression and underwent treatment for depression. She had just commenced kindergarten. The husband had recently been discharged. HELD: The application for interim and the counter application for custody were dismissed. The Court found that it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence that the children are in some way at risk. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to the child exists), but proceed to a final order."
e_2005nssc340.txt,"The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The husband was in the military for 12 years. He was the sole provider of their 16 year old son. He sought a termination of spousal support or a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. The wife was now 42 and the son was in high school. The husband was retired and had a child. The corollary relief judgment, which provided for maintenance of $400 per month for a period of time, was varied to reflect the wife's declining income and the increased costs of caring for the son. The father was seeking to have his pension reduced or reduced to reflect his continuing financial need. The daughter was in need of a stable income and his responsibility to care for the child had been delegated to him. The mother was seeking spousals in the amount of $8,500 per month. The application was heard in June 2005. The applicant received a severance package and pension was to start in September 2005. He will be paying maintenance of approximately $300 per month effective September 2008. The oldest son was residing with his father. The son had a younger sibling who was in pre-school and the mother was working and living with her uncle. The two were married for 13 years. The family lived in poverty and there was no evidence that the mother could become totally self-sufficient. The respondent was now retired and there were no plans to take the child to university. She was also experiencing difficulty in finding employment. The court was sympathetic to the wife’s need for support and sought to end the husband’ s obligation to her. Although the wife had recently retired, she had made some efforts to take some jobs and had been better able to support herself. The couple had a home and a son. Although there was economic hardship resulting from the breakdown of the marriage, the family was still relatively young and there is no evidence she was unable to contribute to her own support. The only limitation on spousaling in a family of four is that the applicant was to pay spousa for support for one month at the time of the application. Should there be a change in the parties’ circumstances before then, an application to vary may be warranted, but in any event the spousAL support will end in August 2008."

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes: Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the military, Civil or Military, or was displaced from their position by the enactment of the Canada Pension Plan Act in 1985. The benefits which the plaintiffs claimed were not paid to them were awarded to them by reason of their service in World War I, World War II or the Korean War and their dependants who received some or all of the benefits. The claim for negligence, misrepresentation and breach of duty did not disclose a cause of action. The claims which the plaintiff claimed were awarded were awarded only to those who had died during the Class Period as opposed to all of those who received benefits. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members. The Court found that only if the class member succeeded in this litigation and reached the bureaucratic stage of applying for the ex gratia payment would the question of individual issues arise. The Act was applicable to all claims. The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England and Wales excepting the failure to adopt a preliminary merits test.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his sentence made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the youth justice court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCPJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had already elapsed. The Crown appeals its decision and argues that the Youth Court Judge erred in her interpretation of the Youth Code. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the legislation is the same as that of the SCCR except that s. 102(2) refers to s. 107. It is included in s.102(2). Section 102(3) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s107 merely as an aid to the reader. 2) The Youth Code has a strong moral foundation and is intended to ensure that youth are able to escape the harsh daily conditions of the community. The youth is deemed not to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the young person is then serving. The Court accepts the Crown's argument and find that the youth court judge erred."

The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for breach and damages. The defendants both testified at trial that they had entered into the agreement to bring in investment capital through a marketing study. The marketing study was to take three months. The position of the defendant is that the period between June 2, 1981 and the time of the marketing study did not continue beyond June 2. That is not mere speculation.

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"Civil Procedure – Custody and Access – Affidavits – AdmissibilityCivil Procedure - Affidavit – Admitting Admissible Evidence – Settlement Planning – Objection to AdmissivityCivil Procedure– Affidavitation – Adoption – Admissible Evidence – Appeal – Judgment The respondent exhibited a letter to the petitioner's counsel that was from his counsel to the respondent's counsel and which was marked 'Without Prejudice' in its entirety and went on to set out a detailed offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on a proposal he made because it is not his to waive. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. Costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such mind."

The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.

The parties lived together for most of the marriage and had four children, ages 12, 12, 13 and 14. The youngest resided with her father. The two parties disagreed on the value of the matrimonial home, arguing that it was an investment on behalf of both parties and must be divided equally. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but sought authorization to obtain passports. Both parents agreed to cooperate in obtaining passports. The matrimony was evident as between the parents' families. The son wanted meaningful consultation and input into major decisions respecting the upbringing and activities of the children.

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s. 27 of The Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs and the defendant’s cattle were strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle on more than one occasion. The difference in damages was that the plaintiff’ s. 7 crop loss was assessed dockage at the elevator and the plaintiff was awarded costs. The court found that the damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows: 1) the plaintiff is liable for crop loss caused by the defendant cattle; 2) the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for damage suffered when his cattle venture into the plaintiff field in the summertime; 3) the damages are assessed as a whole. The damage assessment was based on the plaintiff having to combine most of the field but was not limited to the canola crop; 4) the evidence was considered independent of the plaintiff as to the actual amount of damage; 5) the judge was satisfied that the plaintiffs had not been properly trained in the field to adjust their calculation of damages based on what he had estimated at the time of harvest. The judge found that although the plaintiff had been unable to combine the cattle in the normal fashion, they had been put to the expense and inconvenience of having to deal with the numerous yard-square plots and poor areas of the farm and had been helped by the wife when she was away; and 7) the plaintiffs’ savings in not having to store, transport, or transport the cattle were minimal. The damages were assessed dockages at the elevator."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt filed for a discharge on the basis that s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. Two creditors objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. Revenue Canada objected on the grounds that it was an attempt by the bankrupt to defend himself against claims arising out of a failed agreement and lease to the bankrupt's former business. The bankrupt argued that the failure of his former business to pay tax on the unpaid remittances was a serious issue and the court could not accept that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Act) would allow disclosure of the information. The bankruptcy filed for bankruptcy on the ground that it would bring the tax system and the bankruptcy process into disrepute. HELD: 1)The bankrupt's claim was for $58,720.34. 2)The claim of Revenue Canada was dismissed due to the complexity of the issues. 3)The Court could not find that the principles and exemption in s.(295(6)(a)) of the Excise Tax Act would allow the disclosure in these proceedings. 4)The debtor was denied the right to defend his claim through his lawyer. 5)The court could have ordered more specific orders but could not. 6)The applicant was denied access to the bank's records. 7)The discharge order was denied on the principle of the partial disbursement of monies paid by the applicant to the trustee. 8)The administration and taxation costs were to be paid by a party to the proceedings. 9)The application for a stay of proceedings was opposed by certain creditors. 10)The judge could not make the determination on the application of the bankruptcy judge as to what may be final and what may not be interlocutory. 11)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 was confidential and non-disclosure was improper for these proceedings and the judge could only make the order on the assumption that the applicant had misrepresented his situation. 12)The monies were to pay the bankrupt on the discharge. 13)The plaintiff was granted judgment for $1,750.00 which represents the value of non-exempt asset.  14)The defendant was granted a stay pending judgment. 15)The costs of preparing the discharge were to the applicant. 16)The balance of liability was payable by the parties. 17)The arrears were to each party. 18)The judgment was to be served by the court on the outstanding balance of claims. 19)The"

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an occupational health and safety charge under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He had been out all night at social event, had been drinking and had not slept. He made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy of the dairy farm worker's death. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. His failure was in not securing the manure Pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. The defendant had no prior record for Occupational health and Safety offences. He took steps to improve safety at his farm after the dairy worker's accident. The Court accepted the defendant's guilty plea and found that a $25,000 penalty was appropriate. The penalty should include a significant contribution to farm safety initiatives. The farmer was a self-employed professional and had significant experience in the farming industry. He put in substantial hours of work every day to improve his farm safety. He travelled 160 hours a day to and from the farm to ensure that the barricade was removed and that the manure was properly secured. He also had responsibilities under the Health and safety Act that he did not meet. The Occupational Safety and Health Act prohibits the use of force against an individual in the workplace. The farmworker was conscientious about safety issues before and during his work hours and had endeavored to improve the safety of his farm. He has made substantial improvements to the farm since his farmworker's death and has been in no state to allow him to operate equipment that he needed in the manurepit, such as a safer method for disposing of manure, through gravity fed gratings that the defendant designed himself. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant having a lesser degree of culpability. He only had a record for occupational health/safety offences under the Act."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The father sought costs of $3,000 based on an application of a scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act. The amount involved was $60,000. Costs of $1,000 were assessed against the father. The parties' custody andaccess rights litigated, with the father being the appropriate primary care parent. The assessment of child Support was central issue. Income was imputed to the father, with costs to be determined in the amount involved by the tariffs.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.

The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the defendant. The plaintiffs also brought a second motion requesting that the defendant be examined on its affidavit concerning the alleged breach of of contract by the defendants. The second motion requested that the plaintiff provide notice to the defendant of the persons who had received the package. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) It is important to remember that we are in the pre- certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a class action. An action is defined under s. of TheClass Actions Act as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as class action pursuant to Part II. The defendants have had over the last few years ample opportunity to acquaint themselves with prospective plaintiffs through'some lawful manner'. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and implementation of The Rules of Court do not permit a cross-examination of a plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of pre-examination. 2) The plaintiff was not seeking to compel the defendant to provide pre-warning to potential class members. The cross- examination of the plaintiff could lead to further motions arising out of this examination.  3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. Any intervention by the court prior to certification should be narrowly directed and sparingly employed."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and was now living with her father. Both had children, born in 1984 and 1989. The parties had two adult children, aged 60 and 53. The mother had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend 4 months out of Canada, living in Hawaii and spending a monthlong vacation in Jamaica. The father assumed a substantial portion of the child support. Both children had resumed employment after the separation and the mother was making modest income payments. The chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage, although she testified that she was disabled and did not indicate she was not capable of full time employment. The issue of spousals was reviewed and the chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the mother over 18 without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The appeal was allowed."

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program.

It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the CapeBreton Board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings.

The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support owing $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears of approximately $14,600 was granted in 1993. HELD: The application was dismissed. A further order was ordered, suspending the on-going maintenance of $25,600, to be paid in full in the months when the children were less than $2,200. The father was to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2200.00 or greater and $150.00 per child when his annual child support is less than$2,400.00.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applied for amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel. The applicant submitted that the issue should not be determined on the balance of costs. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $47,000 plus disbursements.  2)The respondent was asked to consider the offer of settlement made by the applicant to the date of the offer, which would result in a reduction of approximately 5,000 fees and disbursement. The respondent's position was that the offer was not credible and that substantial offer made by counsel for the parties was not reasonable. The amount of settlement requested was approximately $200,000 less the amount awarded at trial. 3)The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the timeof entering formal judgment. The jurisprudence is clear that a successful party to litigation who is free of blame should not only be required to bear costs of either prosecuting or defending the action but also to defend their rights in court if an unsuccessful party is required to bore all the costs of a successful one. Solicitor and client Costs are within the discretion of the Court and the re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and is limited to the issue of costs awarded."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.",The appellant's petition for divorce was successful. The issue was whether the parties had reached a binding agreement regarding the value of his pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. The trial judge declared that the issue had been resolved and ordered that the parties should settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis to determine the best way forward. Subsequent pre-rial conferences and examinations did not constitute a binding basis for the agreement. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The pre- trial agreement should not be set aside. 2)The evidence did not indicate that the appellant intended to settle on the piecemeal basis as he had done in previous agreements. 3)The fiat ended all negotiations and the appellant was bound by her agreement as to its value. 4)The court appealed the decision of the trial judge. It was clear that the intention of the parties to settle in a piece piece or insta was not an intention in this case.

The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff filed an application for directions in the determination of a question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01 and, secondly, to dismiss the action for forum non conveniens that was refused. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum nonconiens and at the same time the applicants had not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; whether there are police reports; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors; whether they were located; whether any of the plaintiff's witnesses were seen by the doctors; if so, where they were. In the absence of so many facts about the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant, the plaintiff’s choice of forum will govern. The court concluded that it was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial in Nova Scotia and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurs. The Court also found that Nova Scotia was forum non convenediens. The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. The judge presiding at a trial here will be an interpreter of the law in Nova. If a procedural problem arises, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place of trial. The applicant had succeeded in finding that Nova Scotia was forum conveniens."

The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension. HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date.,"FIAT: The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act. HELD: Although the time lines established by the Court have expired, there is an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the hearing the plaintiffs’ certification motion. If the plaintiffs fail to serve or file the application by August 27, 2010, the defendants may apply for a appropriate remedy."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s487.051(3) of sCriminal Code. The judge declined to make the order. HELD: The Court held the judge erred in declining to make it. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole (she has 53 prior convictions); to have adequate regard for her privacy and security interests; and to have an adequate regard of the objectives of s487(1). In light of the nature of the offender’s current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy, security and privacy interests."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia, at the time his driver's license was revoked. At the time, his driver’s license was also revoked. The only issue at trial was whether this made the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved, or for speeding, which was not the charge before the court. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATT on the road. The accused was not charged with driving a vehicle on a highway while he was revoked, or with speeding, since his licence was revoked and he was not guilty of this offence."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused was acquitted of all other charges. The trial judge focused on the factors leading to the conviction, not on the consequences. The appellant's final argument was that the trial judge erred in not applying the de minimis non curat lex principle. The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused's driving was not mere touching but was nonetheless dangerous. The fact that the complainant was forced off the road to avoid a collision was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver. The evidence showed that the appellant overtook the complainant, pushed her toward the side of the road and deliberately cut her off so she was forced to the side. The location of the incident elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions. The Appeal Court judge was entitled to considerable deference in her assessment of the evidence.HELD: The appeal was allowed. The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was dismissed. The court found that it was a departure from what is expected of an accused in similar circumstances. The offence was serious enough that a three-month driving prohibition was imposed. The facts were so clearly wrong that it could have been argued that the judge erreited in failing to take into account the fact that there was no consent. The respondent was acquitted on all other counts. The decision was based on the evidence of the complainant and was not based on a momentary lapse in attention. The mitigating factors were that the respondent was at the low end of the range and the accused was driving slowly. The complainant was at an adequate level of condition and the Court was entitled not to substitute its own view of the law in its decision."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their four siblings. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court granted provisional permission in August 2013 to the Lawlessness children to attend the school. The family applied to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process. HELD: The Court found that the Lawlers had failed to live up to their ten commitments as a parent and family. The CÉF has failed to provide an educational environment free from discrimination, harassment and discrimination. The Family has failed, and continues to fail, to provide a French first language school.  1) The Court rejected the Lawler's application for an interlocutory injunction as an attempt to undermine their ten year tradition of attending a French school. 2) The Family was not consulted with the Court about the application for a declaration that the CÉFS discriminated against the Lawrays because of their disability. The Act distinguishes between 'conseil scolaire fransaskois' and 'conceil ecole fransaska'. The parties consistently referred to the CéF as the 'CÉF'. The CéLeste is a conseil Scolaire created by s. 42.1 of The Education Act to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransascolas in Saskatchewan. The Education act distinguishes between a 'conselil scule fransaspois' (CSF) and 'counsel' (conseile ecole). The parties clearly stated that the CSF's ostensible concern about the Lawling family's failure to liveup to their commitments was not the real reason for its decision to not renew their provisional permission. The CSF has demonstrated that it has a duty to provide quality educational instruction in a French First Language School to its children. The principles and goals of the CCEF are met in accordance with their respective constitutions. The court awarded the Lawlings special damages for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the costs of preparing the materials for the materials and preparing the necessary support to the end of the school year for their continued education.

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be inoperable. The Applicant applied for mandamus quashing the development officer's decision to declare the application complete and an order of mandamus directing the development director to issue the final approval. Land developer appealed mandamus. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The municipality had no claim to mandamus under s. 283 of the Municipal Government Act. The fact that the applicant had received a tentative approval before the new road standards was incorporated, and had failed to comply with the new requirements, represented a major obstacle to the applicant's progress. The Municipality relied on s. 278 of the MGE in its submission that the higher road standard was applicable to this Application. The application was incomplete. On the same basis, the Applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application was complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan). The applicant was entitled at the declaration that it was complete."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee in order to improve its operations and reduce costs. The plaintiff paid the defendant what the terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months. The action in Nova Scotia was commenced in 1994 and the defendant brought a motion to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The applicant brought this claim on the ground that the defendant failed to meet the requirements of the forum non-conveniens. Dismissing the application, that the plaintiff's default judgment was premature and that the defendants had not shown any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. This was not a mistake or an oversight. The Court reviewed the cases and found that the cases which relied upon the defendant to support its primary argument were not the same as those which were tried in Nova Scotia and were not subject to the Rule 12.06 standard."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issues for resolution were: 1) Divorce; 2) Custody of the children; and 3) Access to the children. The issue of access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1). The respondent was to pay child support of $948 per month for the child born December 11, 1982. The petitioner was to give notice of the expert who would be called to the trial. 2) The respondent's income was reduced by $50 to $1,200 per month. 3) The Court declined to order any spousal support. Given the fact that the petitioner's income is unlikely to increase in the near future, the Court declined the order to which the respondent was entitled at $10,000. 4) The court found that the average capital cost on land and buildings should not be added back for purposes of determining the respondent's Income and for the purpose of the Guideline purposes. 5) The petitioner's land was divided equally and the Court found that $1 million of the total value of the land was to be paid to the respondent in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. 6) The amount of the mortgage debt was paid off by the respondent and was to remain at $1.5 million for the purposes of the Guidelines, but the Court reduced the amount of spousals to $50,000 to be payable to the petitioner and $100,000 was to go to the father."

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. The Government sought an Order striking the phrases 'breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty'; 'not limited to the following' and 'not restricted to the Foursquare and Determining Bishops' and a number of other Act or Acts as were in effect during the material times. The defendant was under a positive fiduciari duty to protect the plaintiff from injury to his person, physical or mental health or morals and the defendant knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff would suffer damages if the defendant failed to carry out its duty. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the offending party.  1)The pleadings did not fulfill the requirements of the Rule 173 and Rule 164 of the Rules. The government was entitled to know the case it had to meet. If the defendant knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not have particulars of the statutes or regulations on he must so state.  2)The conduct of the examinations for discoveries and undertakes can provide a defendant with the particulars of such allegations to permit the plaintiff to properly and expeditiously defend the claim. If it is certain that the action is certain to fail, the defendant must bind him down to a definite story. Particulars will be ordered whenever the master is satisfied that without them the applicant cannot tell what is going to be proved at trial but how his opponent will prove it is a matter of evidence of which particulars will not be ordered. The court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The practice of examinations is not to strike words complained of but to permit a party to properly express their interest in the cause of action. The examinations for the discovery and undertaking can provide you with particulars to permit you to properly defending the action and to permit an inquiry as to the nature of the claim and the nature if any of the claims. The claim is for general damages of $86,000.00. The costs of the action are set out in Table 3."
