Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The sole ground upon which the Information was based was hearsay information from a confidential source and no details were provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. 2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting the Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as a discretionary right to assistance. The fact that the appellant had an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child did not disqualify her from receiving assistance. Rather, it was the respondent's stepfather who was the head of family and maintaining the household in which the appellant lived."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early April, 1987, the project manager, who was retained by the plaintiff to act as general counsel, requested that the funds be disbursed contrary to the letter of direction dated March 9, 1987 and the March 16, 1987 letter providing for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust, but the subsequent issues of knowledge, reliance and causation rendered it appropriate to consider the various issues in the plaintiffs' claim together. Breach of Trust? The plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breaches of trust and could not succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground was dismissed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial'.  1)On the basis of the nature of the offences with which the accused has been charged, on the circumstances surrounding the alleged commission of offences, the accused's stated intention to continue picketing and on his view of what is lawful activity. 2)The picketing was reasonably unjustified under the circumstances."
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants, having destroyed their files, the death of the plaintiff's mother and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years were partners in the practice of law. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. FIAT: The applicants have a good deal of sympathy for the applicants in this case. The plaintiff has not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. 2)There was a significant delay, which must be weighed against the applicants' interests. 3)The applicants' decision to destroy their files was understandable but not a factor that must consider, but only one. 4)The court expressed sympathy and sympathy to the applicants. The applicant's claims face some serious problems. The guest passenger was rear-ended by the vehicle. It is not my duty, however, to pass on these issues."

He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation.

1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff and two juvenile offenders who had been charged with sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl at a roller skating rink had been practicing their newscast at the defendant's radio station early in the morning so as to report the news commencing with the six o'clock bulletin. The defendant refused to cooperate with the Commission's investigation. HELD: The plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed with costs.  1)The defendant published the news that it received from the police, which was always a proven reliable source. 2)The attendance was down for a few days after the broadcast. It would appear that the sexual assault occurred near the roller rink. 3)The defendants did not have a reliable source of income for the plaintiff corporation. The fact that the report in question was never requested by the plaintiff did not disqualify them as a proven source of revenue.  4)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action."
1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of the matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement in order to alleviate the symptoms of her depression. The respondent opposed the separation agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not met the test for admission of fresh evidence and that, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to consider whether or not she has a strong prima facie case that the agreement is unconscionsable."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.,"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant contends she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed. The respondent was not mislead and has not been prejudice.  1)The applicant was nether the executrix named in the Will and received $40 per month in arrears of support. She presented no evidence of the transfer of the land to her, there was no consideration being paid nor was there evidence of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  2)The respondent was entitled to recover the funds from the respondent and asserted her right to discharge of the order under s. 56 of the EMOA.  3)The question for resolution in whether it would in the words of the section be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned was not relevant. Some of the evidence conflicts with the applicant's claim that she paid overdue mortgage installments and no transfer, mortgage, lease or instrument executed by the respondent was subject to the rights of the claimant.  4)Costs of this application were determine by the trial judge."

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action. The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. HELD: The terms of the settlement were not disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the claim. The settlement amount was not allocated to any head of damages so that those issues would have to be traversed also. The applicant could introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and the usual costs as well as costs. The medical witnesses in question should not be referred to as part and parcel of the agreement.

1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The respondent was entitled to exclusive possession. 1)No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of two paragraphs of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide that '15(1) unless otherwise ordered by the judge appealed from or by judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of a judgment or order pending the disposition of the appeal.' 2)The Court was of the view that the giving of directions by the court would not constitute the taking of any action or directing of any part of the action as would not contravene Rule 15. No writ of mandamus, an injunction, or alimony were granted to the petitioner. 3)All applications to be made pursuant to Rule 15 should be directed to the court. 4)All directions to be prepared to re-examine the previous order were prohibited. 5)The issue of when the Court would be required to make a final decision on the matter was resolved. 6)The parties were 71 years of age and the respondent was 77 years old. The Court was to advise the parties in a reasonable time period when the petitioner was to move. 7)The respondent could still proceed to provide the requested directions. 8)Rule 15 would not stay in place where a judgment was stayed pending an appeal unless ordered otherwise ordered. 9)The provision that directions be given by the Court on behalf of the petitioner would not deprive the respondent of the right to make an application pursuant to the Court's Rules of Appeal does not apply to this matter."

HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis.

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(g) and 10(c) had be infringed. HELD: The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer.  1) The accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the opportunity to consult counsel and was treated in all respects as though he was in custody after an arrest. The defence did not call any witnesses. 2) The Court was not in error in that finding. The Court found that the first arrest by the police officer, who was in the Major Crimes Unit, police officers made it clear to the accused that he was detained and in custody. He was advised of his right to counsel, given the standard police caution, and told the reason for his detention. There was no actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention, and the treatment of him amounted to 'de facto' arrest."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The driving must constitute a departure from that of a reasonable prudent person. The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 that the Union had been joined as an intervener by an application to the Supreme Court of Canada under Rule 62.35 and Rule 8. The Union opposed all of the applications advanced by the Union, claiming that they were an attempt to influence the Court's jurisdiction to grant an application for an interim injunction restraining the Intended Defendant from proceeding as sole defendants in a labour dispute within the meaning of s44(1)(b) of the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the chancery in England. The order of October 1st, 1999 continued the interim injunction until further court order. In this case, the Union did not have the status to file an appeal unless it was first joined in either of the two capacities by the Court of Appeal. There are no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as an Intended defendant pursuant to Rule 5.03. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an applicant by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as a plaintiff or as defendant in an interim and interlocutory proceeding. The new rule is significantly different from the provisions in Rule 2.04(1). The Union's application to be joined as either a party or as intervener is apparently not relied upon by counsel in Adams, but the limits on the jurisdiction of a Chambers judge in this Court constitute 'context' restricting the broad definition expressed in Rule 1.05(e)(i)."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in the mother's name to the plaintiff and two other children, Bruce and Wanda. After Mabel died in March 1998, the plaintiff, as litigation guardian of the four granddaughters, alleged that she had given the plaintiff written instructions to prepare four cheques of $5,000 for the benefit of each grandchild. The plaintiff, who had been hospitalized, asked the plaintiff to endorse three cheques in blank to be given to his four grandchildren, who would receive the interest earned on the bank account if anything happened to them. HELD: The instructions were given to the mother. The money was to be held for payment of debts of the deceased estate, with the balance to be divided between the deceased's four children.  1) An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2) An entirely different situation was revealed in McIntyre v. Royal Trust Company, 1946 CanLII 249 (Man. C.A.). The plaintiff was the mother of the plaintiff's four grandchildren and he was to become the trustee for the four grandchildren. 3) The written instructions by the mother were never provided to the father. The mother never gave any consideration to either Royal Trust or Royal Trust companies which would create an equity in her favour.  4) Royal Trust had in its possession all of the share certificates of Pennefather, who presented the following instructions in writing: To the Royal Trust Co. Please sell the above stocks at the market price and pay the proceeds to the Dom. Govt for application on Annuity Contract #69534 in the name of Mrs. Daisy McIntyre. “[Sgnd.] F. R. Pennedad.” The orders were given on March or 10, 1998 at which time the principal amount in the account was $25,000. It was concluded that the instructions were written in the names of the three children and that the mother had given them all the money in her bank account in the joint names of her and the plaintiff. The instructions did not contain any words that could possibly be considered a declarationof trust."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. The question of whether something that is affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. A wheelchair lift loaned to the defendants by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for use of their disabled foster child had ceased to operate a few months after the defendants acquired the house property. The plaintiff and her husband sold the property to the respondent, Elsa San Diego. The vendors advertised the property as being good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. When selling the property, the vendors made no mention to the purchaser, the respondent San Diego, about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The trial judge did not accept Kapronczai's denial that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair lifted was not part of the Realty or was owned by the Abilities Council. There was evidence on which the trial judge could find as he did."

The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(1) of the Income tax Act, ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the receiver. HELD: A compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine or penalty order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out in s. 178(1)(a) and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was not established that either of these individuals held in H.R.P.S. a significant stream of income flowing into HMPS at the time of the offences. Such was not an incumbent position on HMPS which was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom."

Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. The defendant brought motions (the Charter Motions) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and by the RCMP during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation, which he controlled until his bankruptcy.

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs plus disbursements of $1,050.00 plus $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This is not an unreasonable amount of costs to have the plaintiffs recover money. It was necessary to expend time, money and effort to recover what they had. The court also considered the conduct of any party which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding; any step in the proceeding which was improper, vexatious, prolix or unnecessary; any manner in which the proceeding was taken through over-caution, negligence or mistake; any neglect or refusal by any party to make an admission which should have been made; any other matter relevant to the issue of costs."

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing order.

The children's extracurricular activities were to be suspended during two weeks of block holiday time (see: 2005). It was not in the children's best interests to remain in the respondent's care beyond the end of the school year. There was a history of access difficulties between the parties and the respondent had a negative attitude to the child and his role with the children.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the other officer's vehicle. This vehicle only moved a short distance forward before striking the accused. The officer did not gesture or give any other cause for concern other than the complainant's statement to his wife that the vehicle could slow down. The Crown suggested that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the officer was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The defence suggested the accused should have simply continued driving. 2) The accused's evidence that neither was waving their arms or giving any other reason other than that of a person they later determined to be a'sir' did not lock upon impact. The Court was satisfied that the Crown had proved the accused drove careless. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to have stopped his vehicle. He was crossing a parking lot when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was crossing the road, he was asked to assist another officer on a non-priority matter. He reversed his vehicle and crossed the street directly in front of the police vehicle. There was no one else on the scene at the time and the officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused cross the street. He took steps both to assist the officer by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she was not impaired by alcohol at the time she made the demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she wasn't really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand as there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 am. to justify the breath demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by Alcohol.

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The learned trial judge concluded that the Crown was consistent with Fleury's guilt and the circumstantial evidence presented was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is set aside. The appellant argues that, without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal allowed, conviction set aside; conviction sets aside. 1) There was no rational conclusion from the outset that Fleury could have rolled through the stop sign at such a high speed as to be hypothetically rational. However, without such evidence the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find he could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst. Poiré. It seems unlikely that minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without the expert's knowledge of how to do so. 2) The trial judge erred in his conclusion that the evidence from the scene could only have been drawn from the general investigation of the accident scene and from the evidence of the witnesses who testified at the scene. It seemed unlikely that the expert could have drawn such a straight line across the four lanes of traffic without involving the appellant's expert in the process.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.

2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the respondent had burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked the claimant to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The respondent denied having any knowledge of the condition of the property in the past and argued that non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation would in any event lead to total lack of consideration. The court reviewed the law on motions for non-suit and found that most of the time it is necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law such as the test set out in LANG v. Knickle 2006 NSSC 177. The test is whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case or, as it is sometimes described, is being induced to do so by counsel who are represented by Counsel. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with a vast experience and law degree. The small claims court is a forum for discovery and discovery of new evidence. It is not always necessary to determine the sufficiency of evidence. A review of the evidence and the statute of limitations will allow the court to make a determination based on the evidence as to whether the claim was sufficiently advanced to warrant a challenge to the validity of the disclosure."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm to his passenger. The appellant appealed both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2) In all of the circumstances of this case the error had no effect on the trial."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife.

Although the defendant was driving slowly at night, the vehicle was under surveillance on continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes. The three occupants of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber and four live rounds in the magazine, the rifle that was in the back seat was loaded with live rounds and the spotlight and a cassette tape of bull and cow mating sounds were located on the rear seat of the truck. All three occupants were cooperative and cooperative with the officers who pulled them over, and admitted that they had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck as they were tired from their day of hunting. There were some uncontroverted facts, all of which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the Defendant was employing the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The terms 'hunting' and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or the Regulations. The defendant stated that he had dropped his son and nephew off in the forest earlier in the day and had returned to pick them up later in the evening. However, he stated that it took him 45 minutes to arrive at the location where he picked them up, and that his two young nephews fell asleep within five minutes of driving through the forest. He acknowledged that his son had been attacked by moose earlier that day and was seriously concerned that he might have been injured by wayward moose."

Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. The court has supervisory and protecting power over its own records. Little that is filed in the Family Division is filed voluntarily. Most of the material in the file must be filed by the rules of court and, on occasion, court order. This requires a public interest and social interest imbedded in the expectation of privacy and confidentiality for personal identifiers and the risk of identity theft is real. Both parties sought to have the file sealed to protect their reputation, their reputation against unproven allegations that may be contained in material filed in this proceeding. The applicant and respondent sought exclusion of the public on the date of the hearing and in a separate file, not accessible to the public, unless party makes a motion within the required time. There was no publication ban."

He argued the judge erred by not ordering a stay of proceedings and/or a dismissal at the beginning of the trial, and by failing to find the non-disclosure violated his rights under s. 11(d) of the Charter. He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter. It is therefore not appealable.","This was an appeal from a decision wherein the trial judge declared a mistrial and set a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record that contained the individual weighing of each set of wheels on the accused tandem axle truck.

3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant took the position that it was not appropriate to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. and that the court's inherent jurisdiction did not give it the jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest was involved. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered for an assessment unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act.  1)The Act does not authorize the appointed trustee as an amicus curiae to represent the person alleged to be of unsound mind in cases of where a Property interest is involved. 2)The Public Trustees Act only gives an individual the jurisdiction where it is inexcusably bound by the laws of the day. 3)The legislation does not give the public trustee the ability or the competence to properly represent and fairly represent a person who may be autistic or mentally incompetent adult.

3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","In an action for unpaid monies, Turf Masters obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been aware of the material non-disclosure reports made by the city and CBCL, which had been incorporated into the original action. Shortly after commencing the work, the city found that there were significant subsurface problems with the site which made the work more difficult and costly. The plaintiff commenced an action against both the City and the CBCL in quantum meruit alleging negligent misrepresentation and breach of standard of care and claiming indemnity and negligence against the City. The defendant commenced a separate action against the plaintiff in the same court, this time under the Mechanics' Lien Act. In this action, the defendant requested certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. HELD: The Court dismissed the defendant's application and dismissed the present action. 1)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to this application. 2)The Court was satisfied that the parties had the opportunity to plead their entire case before the trial in 1993 and the horrendous costs encountered in that first action, but the denial of any opportunity for the plaintiff to attempt to have all the allegations heard at one trial constitutes serious prejudice. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same factual cause of action. 3)There was no final decision or judgment on any of the issues to be determined in the first action."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge at the hearing of the appeal was faced with conflicting affidavits. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the issues between the two parties. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed. 1) The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7.1(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1(a). 2) There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of any relevant issue and we reaffirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). 3) Another ground of appeal concerned the $230 per month ordered to pay in respect of extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities with the meaning of s. 17(6.2)of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which, the appellant argued contained special provisions to benefit the children. He argued these expenses fell within the standard of living within the guidelines. He did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the guidelines; the appellant had received bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and he had not a business based in the home. He claimed these expenses were 'ordinary activities and expenses of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of these children's parents."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over the legal limit contrary to ss.255(b) and ss.253(a). The police testified at trial that they followed the accused into service station at 8:20 p.m. and observed they displayed an out of date sticker on its licence plate in violation of s. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The officer engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. The accused nearly fell over when he exited. The police officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate the motor vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 pm. The Court reviewed the various types of random stops made by police throughout Canada and concluded that they were justified. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner taking away jurisdiction granted to officer by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act."

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.

A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status.

The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.

3_2004skca49.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. The consent judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At the time of the application the respondent was 15 years old and residing with his mother. The petitioner claimed that she wished to spend more time with her father. HELD: The application to vary custody was dismissed. The material change in circumstances did not warrant a variation. The existing access order allows the respondent to define the extent of access or time spent with each of his parents. There was no change to the 1995 access order. The present respondent was, as of August 2003, in 10 months arrears of child support. There were no costs awarded.  1) The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The fact that the respondent is 15 and presumably all the wiser than she was two years ago indicates that his relationship with his daughter is genuine. It is clear that her best interests require that the status quo be continued. 2) The respondent failed to file any income tax returns, notices of assessment or re-assessment in support of his application. The transcript of evidence reveals an extensive and thorough cross-examination of the respondent upon his April 19 letter, clinical notes and his assessment of his patient. Nowhere in the material does the respondent state that he did not file income taxes returns. 3) The affidavit filed by the respondent on July 25, 2003 indicated that he was self-employed but currently on disability and set out his income from disability to be $9,383.56. 4) The petitioner has been in the primary care of her mother since July 31, 1997. Her principal residence continues to be with her mother and is closely located to her collegiate and circle of friends. 5) The parties will continue to jointly pay child support in the amount of $250.00 per month. 6) The Court dismissed the respondent's application for variation of the custody order."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, now plead guilty to three counts of breaking and entering. The charge of being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused was sentenced to three-and-a-half years imprisonment along with a fine of $10,000 and a 10 year prohibition from possessing or transferring a weapon. The Crown sought a term of four years and six months imprisonment, plus an eight month prohibition from the use of a weapon and asked that the sentences be reduced to a period of six years incarceration. The accused argued that the maximum sentence he could get for breaking and enters was a maximum of 10 years, which would include imprisonment for the offences committed under s. 348(1)(e) of the Criminal Code. He also argued that there should be a life sentence for the break and enter charge as he had a Grade X education and that he had been involved in sporadic employment over his adult years. HELD: The appropriate sentence was for the offence committed and that the co-accused plead guilty. The aggravating circumstances of the offence and the fact that the accused's vehicle went off the road and the vehicle upset gave the Crown hope that the sentence would be similar to sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. A further reduction of one-half year would be justified."
4_1999canlii12738.txt,"The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity. The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The accused was charged with robbery. The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found guilty of robbery. 1)The letter was not an alibi. It was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an Alibi by perjury. 2)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary, preliminary, and trial (eleven months after the robbery) was not a reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up as he did not have a mustache at the time of the robbery. 3)The only conclusion drawn from the evidence was that the accused was not at the club when the robbery took place. 4)There was no other explanation in evidence for the request for the false evidence to be given. The accused had no reasonable doubt that the motorcyclist on the second occasion and the person reported to the police at that time were the same person the accused and that his letter was a direct admission that he was not there."

He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited. The monies paid into court will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal.,The appellant appealed an order in Queen's Bench granting him child support. He argued that personal service was required. He also questioned the validity of service by mail. The Queen’s Bench file indicates that the application was served by mail addressed to his home address an address which he designated as his address for service upon electing to represent himself. HELD: The appeal was granted. The appellant was allowed to file an affidavit of eligibility and prove that his s. 7 expenses were necessary and reasonable. Costs to the respondent were reserved on the basis of the fact that the respondent paid 79% of the following Section 7 expenses in the amount of $633 per month. He was directed to arrange for the respondent to pay costs to the petitioner in the sum of $450. An order under Rule 15 staying execution and garnishment proceedings with respect to para. 2 and para. 4 of the above order were stayed.
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule', which is a three step process. Whether an insurer is bound to defend depends on the factors set out in the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the form of a statement of claim. 2) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If the alleged negligence is based on the same facts, and resulted in the same harm to the plaintiff, the insurer is obliged to defend. 3) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the plaintiff's obligation to defend by reason of an exclusion under the policy. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 4) The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listened to defendant's counsel and read the material attached to his lawyer's affidavit, one found there were significant other factors affecting the plaintiff's health. Judgement was entered against the defendant as to liability for the accident and against the plaintiff as to the amount of damages to be assessed. The defendant argued there should be an 'air of realism' to the plaintiffs argument that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The court granted the appeal and set aside the order of the trial judge. It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. There has to be an air of realism to the defendant's argument. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of plaintiff's car. There was conflict in her evidence about her depression and other problems she was having with her health. There is a risk that further injuries will result in her having to relearn how to work in any capacity given the state of the law regarding injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents. This is an extremely minor injury which could be overcome by the use of an independent medical exam."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay monthly spousal and child support of $2,000. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous amount; the father took responsibility for $9,000 in arrears; and for the cost of the children's education, which was not part of the agreement. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement, who returned the post dated cheques from the respondent in October 2005 and requested enforcement of the amount in the original order. The respondent did not contest this method of providing child support. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2005 as a result of the parties' agreement to vary in monthly payments. She alleged she received $10,000 as an advance from the father in order to purchase a car and that she was unable to find employment outside of Nova Scotia after the marriage. She claimed she lost her income due to the difficulty of paying the costs of her children's post secondary education under the agreement; she claimed she had lost her savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home when the parties moved from Halifax to New Brunswick and that the father had not pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; she had taken on volunteer work in the community and did not have the means to do so. Although she may have found employment outside the Nova Scotia community, she did not pursue any further education or further training as a consequence of the marriage and had not obtained employment insurance prior to the separation. She did not establish any employment prospects outside Nova Scotia, and had no savings or pre separation RRSPs or equity. The history of the four children leaving their mother's care and moving in with their father and being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven. [1] There has been no variation of this order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment dated the 24th day of April, 1996.

4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA, and $40,000 security for costs. The plaintiffs argued that they had failed to prosecute this action without delay. Application to amend the order granted in part; application to add the plaintiff; and amendment of the statement of claim granted to the defendants. HELD: 1)The preservation order was originally granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 5(1)(a)(ii) and (b) of The Limitations Act. It was amended by consent in October 2014 to provide that the plaintiff would hold the 850,000 shares pursuant to an escrow agreement; and 2)The amendments sought would not create a wholly new proceeding.  3)There was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims and neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments.  4)The applications to terminate or modify the order were not the first application to terminate it. The second application was denied. 5)The court exercised its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a plaintiff and amendment the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed.  6)The Court reviewed the case law in Pollock Saskech Inspection Ltd. 2013 SKQB 409 (CanLII), at paras 26-37, 432 Sask 227 and adopted the test proposed in Duke Vervaeck, 2000 SKQB 439 (CanlII), reaching the same conclusion. 7)It is open to the court to terminate a preservation order granted under s.5 of The EMJA if the applicant shows grounds that would vitiate contract. 8)The proposed changes to the original pleadings must not be so dramatic as to effectively create a new proceeding as s.20 is not addressed solely to adding party, but substituting party and adding claim. The addition of the plaintiff will not create chaos. The two conditions specified in ss.20(a) and(b) exist. The first condition is that the applicant has chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It is their position that this action is 'totally independent' from the Turks Proceedings and that even if there is some logic in securing the Turkish judgment before dealing with enforcement, that approach became unacceptable"

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. In addition to apportioning costs, the plaintiff apportioned costs on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $50,000.00. Counsel advised that there may be situations where court may exercise discretion pursuant to rule 63.02 and award costs other than in the same proportions as the findings of fault. In this case the Court was not persuaded that the general rule of law, as applied at the time of the accident, would justify an award of 3-1/2 times as much as the eventual award."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Crown did not promise that it would be bound by the conclusions of Klebuc J. in relation to the indictment but had instead used the opportunity to cross-examine him to assist in preparing its case against the accused. 2) The application to quash count #1 raised substantively the same question as that which it did not agree with. 3) It is common ground that the Crown takes the position that it preferred to proceed with the trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial. However, it was agreed that both the accused and the Crown would have the benefit of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused. 4) In light of the new indictment, the Crown is considering an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590(a) and s. 7 and 24(1). 5) In this case, the substantive question raised by this application has in the past been determined three times in these proceedings. The Crown is not bound in this proceeding by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. 5) However, in light of a newly amended indictment, it is important to recognize that the applicant was not at jeopardy in the original trial and his guilt was not itself in issue. It would have been improper to make findings explicitly against the respondent in the current indictment but would not necessarily have pursued or emphasized those aspects that also proved the nature or extent of the respondent's involvement. 6) In some cases the Crown conceded that its agreement to waive any objections to delay until the outcome of the Schafer trial was known was breached by the Crown, but argued that it was not bound by those findings. 7) The applicant was granted an order to remain in the proceedings on the basis of that decision."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor-trailer unit that was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. There were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so he was prohibited from driving the unit. Signs warning and advising of weight restrictions were located along highway #332. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily. The Department of Highways had erected signs in the area advising of an alternative truck route and directing highway users to follow designated truck route.

HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. SpOUSAL support was varied to $5,500 per month from May 1, 2002 and will be varied in the amount of $1,000. The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in shared living arrangements are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal argued that the trial judge was inconsistent with the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 (LTA), and that permitting the respondent to enforce the covenant to postpone contained in the Grant Agreement between the appellant and the respondent violated the principle of privity of contract. The respondent agreed to a delay in favour of the applicant, which allowed the applicant to apply for a mortgage of a limited interest. The trial judge found that the applicant's fee simple mortgage had priority over the respondent's mortgage, as the applicant had agreed to purchase the land from the CPR and that its interest would be subordinate to mortgages granted by the mortgagor for certain purposes. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the LTA is only effective pursuant to the terms of the instrument and law on which the interest is based and is not subject to fraud, which is not alleged in this case. On the basis of the above authorities, the appellant's mortgage was an unregistered interest, but it did confer rights on the appellant."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s. 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief in his obligation to report the accident. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from the trial on the basis that they were made in violation of the accused's s.7 rights and were not made in good faith. There was no basis to exclude the statements made after the arrest or after the demand. The defence argued that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident and gave self- incriminating statements that were made under compulsion of statute, the admission would render the trial unfair. The evidence received, the statements in particular were self incriminating and conscriptive. The admission would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer.  1) The arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand, which leaves nothing to be excluded. 2) The defence claimed that the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by the breach of accused's section 7 rights and that he was only making these statements because he felt compelled to do so by his statutory obligation. The Crown argued that since the defence was making this argument and the statements were made while the accused was in hospital, the exclusion of them would leave nothing behind. 3) The accused responded to the officer that he knew his rights and understood the warning and demand for a blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout. However, he had no recollection of him placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the demand for the blood. 4) The evidence obtained, the self-initiating statements made under coercion of statute have been excluded. If the Crown concedes that the accused had a legal obligation to Report the accident promptly, and if it finds the accused believes he did so because he believed he had to under a statute, then the law requires it to exclude those statements. 5) The officer did not commit a serious, intentional disregard of his or her rights nor was he taking a position of authority to interfere with his own. He was only following up on those excluded statements with those he felt were in breach."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claimants obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. In November 2005, the Respondent commenced an Action for a Breach of Contract against Eastside in the Alberta Courtof Queen’s Bench. Direct Cash then commenced another action in the Small Claims Court of Nova Scotia for reciprocal enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and in the alternative, enforcement of a debt as contract. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the SCC. The parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review is correctness. The issue was whether Section 9 of the Act could be interpreted to include claims arising out of a foreign judgment. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small claims Court Act."
5_2008skqb210.txt,"Applicant seeks an order for an assessment of his legal bill. A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered by the respondent. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time and order the assessment. The evidence before the court is that the Back-Track matter and the BASF matter were separate actions. The last bill was not given to the applicant until after the expiration of the time set out in the billing document. The May 29, 2007 account was on the file and had not been previously forwarded. There were discussions between the applicant and the registrar concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered, and for period of time thereafter. Neither party has alleged or established that any prejudice would result from the abridgement of time. The Court is satisfied that the application for assessment will be dismissed."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; the appellant pulled over for a roadside warning and there was an odour of alcohol on her breath. The appellant contends that the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) On the whole of the evidence, there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high.  2) In a situation such as this, where a detainee, who had previously asserted her right to contact lawyer, later indicated change of mind and stated that she no longer wished to obtain legal advice, the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. When making demand for breath sample, an officer is only required to believe that the suspect has committed an offence and objectively there must be reasonable and probable grounds for that belief. In this situation the police must advise the detainee of his right to be given a reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel and the court has an obligation not to elicit any incriminated evidence until she has been granted that opportunity. Any indication of change in mind must be clear and the burden of establishing an unconditional waiver is on the Crown. The waiver must be free and voluntary and must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. On this part of the review, the judge's decision is entitled to more deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the judge should not be disturbed."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: A formal judgment was issued and the application was to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a 'voice of the child report' be prepared. The application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes V. expressing a desire to live full time with her. If a variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, the Voice of The Child report will meaningfully assist the Court in determining a custody and access plan that is in the best interests of V. The parents are both significantly strapped financially at the time of this application and are declining to make an order allocating the costs of the report to them. It is to be borne through the parents. An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there a resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the court in deciding the application."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff states that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant states that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter. The issue was whether the agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Act have been satisfied. 2) By inquiring into the words used by the defendant and the context in which those words were used, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. What may have been meant by Mr. Ziola's question and Mr. Petrie's answer regarding the subject quarters and the value of the deposit respecting the Adjacent Quarters is irrelevant.  3) In order for the contract to have been created, it must be reasonably understood, the parties must have had at least one conversation in which they were both trying to decide whether or not a particular piece of land should be included in the purchase price of the particular parcel of land. To conclude that the contract was formed, that the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant clearly stated that he would not be accepting either of the Package Offers. 4) The court accepts that the defendants were truthful and credible witnesses and that their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process has entangled them in a three and a half year disagreement, resulting in this lawsuit."

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances created a reasonable apprehension of bias which resulted in a denial of natural justice.

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act.

The Chambers judge held that he would grant the order respecting the records respecting Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel with two limitations; the examination should be limited to income received by the respondent from these entities and because counsel for the respondent said that all information had been provided up to the original trial, the examination would only limited to material from that time forward.

The Board may apply incentives to the respondent to participate by following the procedures in Sections 12(5),(6) and 7(7). HELD: The application was adjourned to August 21, 2000 at 1:30 p.m. and leave was given to each of the applicant and respondent to file further materials. 1)The purpose of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act as set out in Section 2 was to encourage discussions between debtors and creditors and the only material before me indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues. 2)The applicant's motion materials ought to a least include; a) a writ of certifying to be the 'equitable mortgage' to which the materials filed refer. (2) c) a certified copy of title to the land to establish that the proper parties are before this court. d) all material intended by the Applicant to be used to discharge the burden of proof described in Section 18. e) a specific dep deposition as which the land was or was not a homestead. 3)The Farmland Security Board was requested to supply its report to the Court following the procedure set out by s.12(12)(b) and s.7 of the legislation. 4)No costs to any party."
6_2000skqb202.txt,"An appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay $3,414.50 to the tenant. In issue was the jurisdiction of the Deputy Rentalsman to impose an award on the appellant who was acting as a representative for the landlord and not in his own right and who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him and who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord. An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice. There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence. 2)There was no error of law. The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue. The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes. This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance).","This was an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay the sum of $3,414 to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The correct definition of an agent of the landlord is that of a representative for a landlord. The fact that the appellant received notice that he was named as a party in the hearing notice clearly indicated he was now a named party. There was no merit to the suggestion that he did not receive notice of a hearing where an award could be made against him. Furthermore, there was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf."

HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He shouted at patients or potential patients of the health care facility that they were 'fornicators' and showed people pictures of aborted fetuses. He took photographs of the demonstration which were seen by the public and potential patients; he displayed signs that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids. He also displayed messages that said abortion would be corrupting and that Planned Parenthood was the world's biggest baby killer. He displayed these signs while demonstrating outside of Planned Parenthood. There was a complaint to the RCMP but no charges were brought. The applicant sought a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges on the grounds that his Charter rights were infringed. The SAPLN took the position that this Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act. Several factors should have been taken into consideration, among which the procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. Other relevant factors included the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the complainant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the complainant as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel and the parties may proceed to a pre-trial and a trial if necessary on the issues agreed to by the parties.  1) The court agreed that the only way to resolve the conflicts would be by holding a viva voce hearing. The petitioner has not withdrawn as counsel.

6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and the estate of her late mother. Over $50,000 was held on deposit in the account by the appellant and the respondents. Akerley and Gregoire served as adminstratrix of the estate. The respondent and the appellant children were children of the late Mrs. Scott. The probate court judge found that, unless all the evidence was put forward, the account was not properly handled by the Probate Court. Further investigation was required. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility. The evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. The standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge was not palpable and overriding error. The same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless a question of fact is readily extricable when the standard will be that of correctness. In this case, the appellant's appeal was dismissed."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling had been completely burned out and there were no sound of fire alarms. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not functioning at the time of the fire and the plaintiff's had not received advance warning of the existence of smoke or fire for several days. The smoke alarm system was not working prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; there were problems with the smoke detector and its fire alarm systems; the self-closing hallway doors were continually in an open position and the plaintiffs were not advised as to whether the door was locked or closed. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, it created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire as the fire spread quickly and the smoke detectors did not operate properly."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.",The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff had sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had a strong prima facie case on the merits. Application dismissed; the plaintiff failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer injury greater than that which will be suffered if the injunction was granted; the defendant's interests must receive the same consideration as the plaintiff's.
7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","An application for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the parties and directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers had priority to the security interests of the respondent in them.  1)The issue to be determined was what was meant by the term 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, the Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of the priority section.  2)The respondent was not in possession prior to December 22, 1997. Neither the respondent nor Mid-Canada was in possession at the requested time.  3)It was obvious that the trailers were not in the physical possession of them until the prospective buyer purchased them from Lake Air in May 1996. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respective trailer was delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000.

The 1991 order was made in connection with a previous variation application brought by the applicant to vary former $450.00 per month child support. HELD: Arrears of child support were cancelled at the rate of $1,900, being one-half of the total of $3,800 in arrears. 1)The mother was capable of earning $15,000 during the year. The father was not entitled to a variation order setting child support at the level that automatically flows from the choices they make respecting their employment and income.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order, the father has been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing.

HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government of Canada based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement proceeds will be divided equally among the parties. 1)It is not offensive to direct that the respondent's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the father's counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate. 2)It was ordered in the case of the Indian residential school abuse that the father be restrained from disposing of any money he had received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit. The first $40,000, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees, disbursement and tax, was paid into court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same.

The court found that it would be unfair or unconscionable to divide the pension funds of one spouse over another. The respondent was also entitled to an increase in child support.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent.

HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) Although the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, the Court was satisfied that in the circumstances of this case the applicant retained a legal interest in the farm site which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2) Even if the original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. This funding was depleted during the period of suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: There is no dispute on the facts. Both parties relied on the record developed in earlier proceedings. In the context in which the question arises, and the object and purpose of the policy, the exclusivity of the jurisdiction extends to judging that the university satisfy standards that are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere. It is important to maintain the integrity of the college's supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies, and potential financial implications for itself, if it should make an exception. The fact that the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that systemic forces were at work beyond the student's control."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period between 2005 and 2006.

The purpose of the conference is to give advice and provide recommendations on sentencing, which also is part of the court process. 2) The court must expect to be presented with evidence credible on its face of the anticipated risks that an open inquiry would present, including evidence of the adequacy of government programs and support for the young person who apparently suffers from mental health issues and who is in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services. The risk posed by the information shared is real, substantial and well grounded in the evidence."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after being hit from behind by a motor vehicle. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident and was defended by the Facility Association. She was present when the accident occurred and was not directly involved. She commenced this action to advance a claim for mental shock. It was admitted that she was physically injured as a result of the injury and that she struck some object with his fist, causing physical injury and arguably suffering emotional pain. The Plaintiff's claim against the defendant was settled for $1,000. The Court concluded that such was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Regarding the Plaintiff's s. 139 (2)(b) claim, that Section 139 of the Insurance Act does not apply to a person who suffered a mental injury such as the death of a relative of a person insured under the contract. Once again, the Court did not conclude that such a condition existed in the circumstances of this case."

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision reviewing a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman granting an order of possession and issuing a writ of possession. Their reasons were that the rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy was served and the tenant had failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. HELD: Application allowed. 1) The tenants had until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their appeal book and factum. 2) The Chambers judge did not err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid. 3) There was no order as to costs."

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. Given that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arreaars. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrerears, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the applicant rescission, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay arrear and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay the Arrears. 3) There are three reasons for the dismissal of the application. 1) It appears that the applicant has failed to provide the Court with an explanation as to his significant delay in seeking relief from child support. He was stubborn. The applicant provides no evidence as why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002, and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason. It is fair to adjust the respondent's monthly child support payment as at November 1, 2006 given his current income and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation. The Applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely, the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In the meantime, he has established his ability to pay his ongoing maintenance payments. The Court is dismissing the applicant's application for rescission. 4) The Applicant appears to have a sufficient reason as set out in his income tax summaries reflecting his income for the years from 1995 through to 2004. He swore a financial statement on February 15, 2006 wherein he set out his current earnings. Based on these earnings, the Court determines he has an obligation, according to the British Columbia Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. The"
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to S.253(b). The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253B. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1)The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting or advising him of his rights and while conducting a search of his vehicle is an error of fact. 2)Because there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found in the vehicle, the police should have been prompted to make a demand. However, the officer chose to have Shire wait in the police vehicle because the search was being conducted at the side of the road and an obstreperous passenger was occurring while he was dealing with the passengers. The delay in taking the test and in advising the accused of his right to retain and instruct counsel violated the Charter. 3)Although this was not a random vehicle stop, the accused was detained for 17 minutes while the police waited for a roadside screening demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis was conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of his Charter rights."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order requiring the respondent to comply with the February 3, 2014 order of the Development Officer of the Saskatchewan RM. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation of two memoranda and several affidavits, remained in contempt of court. The Court found that the respondent had not made significant progress in complying with the orders nor had he demonstrated that he could meet the onus of enforcement of the orders on him. As a result, the Court awarded the respondent solicitor and client costs of $15,000.00. The amount of the contempt application was increased to $25,000 as a result of the respondent's continued non-compliance. The court noted that it was not unusual for a person bound by an order of court requiring them to do something or refrain from doing something, disobeys that order, and chooses not to comply. The choices made by the respondent have had significant financial implications for all ratepayers of the RM whose taxes have regrettably but necessarily been used to fund these contempt proceedings. The provisions of Queen's Bench Rule 11-1 provide for solicitor-client costs in exceptional circumstances, including but not limited to situations where the conduct of the party against whom costs are sought is scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible. The actions of Mr. Schmidt have further exacerbated the difficulty of enforcing the orders and the Court is concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the respondent."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse following a trial before a judge and jury. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and Mr. Windrum. The defendant argued that he was being directed by the judge to make the choice between giving a verbal warning to each witness or allowing the defence to withdraw their application. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to give a sufficient warning. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The defendant gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The evidence given by the witness who is not inherently suspect, or who is for some reason unsavoury or disreputable, may give rise to a high level of concern and warrantution. In these circumstances, trial judges must give strong consideration to instructing the jury about the dangers of relying on the witness's unconfirmed evidence and explain to the jury why it is dangerous to do so without some corroborating evidence.  2) There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence. The scientific evidence did not, contrary to the submissions of Mr. Healey, support the version of events given by Susan Saxon. 3) The jury was properly informed of the potential dangers inherent in the defendant's testimony based on the evidence at the scene. 4) The evidence from the Crown and the defence was properly considered in light of the circumstances of the case to determine whether the trustworthiness of that witness was impaired."

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents hotel employees union filed complaints against the respondent, alleging unfair labour practices. The respondent was refusing to employ the individual complainants because they are members of trade union and participated in the activities of a trade union. The union alleged the respondent was trying to intimidate its employees to refrain from being members of the trade union or participating in activities of union. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per the reasons stated in the passage from deSmith. The giving of reasons serves several purposes. First, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been made in good faith and that in the absence of even brief reasons, the decision-maker can make a satisfactory decision. Second, the reasons are required because the consequences for the individual are substantial. In this case the decisions of the Board were protected by the privative clause in s. 19(1) of the Act. They could only be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness of the decisions. It was not possible to determine from the ordered reasons what subsection of s. 53 of the Trade Union Act the Board found was violated, giving rise to an unfair labour practice. Third, the evidence was not clear what reasoning led to this applicant being found to be a danger to the public and should be returned. The Board was not required to provide reasons for its decisions."

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.

In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay and that by reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62 of The Labour Standards Act. 2) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. 3) The evidence is that the applicant is businessman running commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document and would not be disappointed if the proper steps to dispute it were not taken within the specified period of time. 4) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not be set aside. 6) The applicant has not demonstrated wilful blindness. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served but not defended, she would not have been informed by the employer that any further action was required."

HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing. It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants. Further, the Court found there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's decision on all his findings of fact. Appeal dismissed.","An appeal pursuant to s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of a hearing officer appointed under the Act who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68 and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlord in possession. The grounds for the application were that the tenant had unreasonably disturbed other tenants within the meaning of ss. 68(2)(a)(i) of the act. HELD: The material available for review is limited to the notice of appeal from the decision of the hearing officer and the documents filed by the Hearing Officer. The court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. In this type of appeal, the court may not revisit the questions or issues of fact determined by the hearing officers.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused's pre-sentence reports filed show that he had a less active role and he did not smash windows, inflict blows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be convicted of the first two mos. of his secure custody disposition in open custody and that he should be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years. The sentences were concurrent as an adult with a concurrent sentence of 25 months custody and supervision followed by 2 months open custody followed by 7 months supervision in the community. 1) The Court held that the offences committed were similar and that they did not constitute a pattern of repetitive behaviour. 2) Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied they were not premeditated and were of limited duration as shown on the video surveillance DVD. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements for imprisonment. 3) The predicate offence, as determined by the Court in R. v. Warawa, 2012 SKQB 101, was a significant change to the dangerous offender regime. The wording in section 753(1)(a)(i) has changed from'may' to'shall' making the finding that an offender is dangerous mandatory once the statutory criteria are made out. One of the reasons the Court reviewed the 2008 amendments was because it was the first time the Court had considered the use of the term 'predatory' in describing the behaviour of an offender who had been previously convicted of such offences as robbery, assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault, and similar offences. 4) There was no indication of violence to others."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm on December 28, 2011. The Court found that the three had consented to the use of a roofing hammer and that they had discussed confronting the victim after night of drinking. The victim had suffered significant injuries as a result of the assault. The three accused admitted to the assault and gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to re-offend. The 9-1-1 recording brought home what was happening during that short but intense time period. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The accused were sentenced to 12 to 18 months imprisonment."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court found the children to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of these children. Decisions like this one are life-changing for so many people. The children have proven resilient, the parents are engaged with the criminal justice system, the father is engaged with serious matters, the children have been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose and the father has been absent from the children's lives for the past three years. The Court concluded that good intentions by themselves were not sufficient to enable the father to continue to abuse these children and to require him to take measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration. The order was set aside without costs. HELD: The appeal was granted with costs to the respondents. 1)The Court found that the proposal was not a development as defined by the Environmental Assessment act because it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s. 9 of the Act.  2)The majority of the facts deposed to in those affidavits were based on information and belief. 3)There was no disagreement on the essential underlying facts. 4)The affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the appellant and the respondents were in breach of the Rule and those portions may not be considered. 5)The respondent did not seek costs. 6)The court did not permit the use of affidavits taken at their highest probative value. The affidavits did not prove on the requisite standard of proof that the KSS project was development. 7)It was not necessary to consider the application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status. 8)The KSS application was granted. 9)The second issue was whether there was a need for wider public consultation as the applicant had already spent time preparing the affidavit evidence and preparation for the application which was to be heard on the return date of the appeal. 10)The respondents were awarded costs. 11)The amount of time it would take them to process the affidavits was $12,000. 12)Costs were awarded to the respondent."

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. Although the applicant did not deny the factual information provided in the Minister's supporting affidavit, she should have provided it at the protection hearing, otherwise she must accept all of the allegations as proof of the protection finding pursuant to section 22(2) (k). HELD: The order of production was granted. The documents requested will not be produced for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the orders made. Costs will be placed on service providers who are asked to produce only relevant records or to prepare report or answer interrogatories. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent and [E.K.] but seeks the return of [C.S.] to her care. HELD: 1) The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial. He was served with the notice of the application and the trial on the issue of custody. 2) In the course of the trial, the respondent will consider the best interests of the child, the importance of continuity in the child's care and the possible effect on the child of delay in making a decision. 3) The evidence in the trial is conclusive that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest in the respondent. The Court finds that it is appropriate for the respondent to have generous and flexible access to the children, and that the Department should obtain information about the respondent's treatment compliance with her mental health facilities. 4) There is no evidence that criminal charges were laid as a result of this information. 5) The child is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The child who is the subject of this investigation is 11 year old status Indian whose name is included in a Band List or who is entitled to have his name included in his Band List. The court finds that 11 year olds who are in need of protection do not have the means to achieve this level of protection. They are at the age of 12 years of age and can be placed in the care of any adult on an equal or greater basis. 6) There are no circumstances to justify the permanent placement of the children in the custody of an adult on the basis that the child has a significant history of domestic violence and may be of interest to the respondent in some capacity. The administration of justice is in the minority and it would be inappropriate for the Court to order an order permanently committing the child to the Department. 7) The Court does not consider the evidence in support of this finding sufficient to justify an order for custody. 8) The children are 11 and 12 years old. 9) The Apprehension is a serious case of neglect and the Court found that 11 children of this age and of any other age group are at risk of exposure to harmful interaction for sexual purpose, including involvement in prostitution, drugs, or violence. 10) The Children have been"
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. The appellant appealed from that judgment. Appeal dismissed; cross-appeal dismissed. The aspects of the Protocol that allow the Government to request more information about the services underpinning an account are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is an individualized administrative process and the aspects which deal with the AU code are designed to facilitate the payment of an account and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. A. The application of the protocol is based on s. 18(2) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (the MCIA) and it involves agreements between individual physicians and the Government for payment of insured services. The purpose of the MCIA is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished.' Rather, it is to facilitate payment of physician services by providing services in accordance with the principles of the Payment Schedule. B) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. The arrangements in this case are best characterized by the use of particular billing schedule rules and codes for multiples during the year using January 1, 1996 as start date. This means up to four echocardiograms will be paid per month and the second at 50% and the final two at 25%. All others should be rejected with explanatory code FK. In this case, the Protocol is best characterized as a means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by the account and other services. It does not alter the entitlement to be compensated for providing an ECG or Holter monitor test at precisely the same rate as other physicians in Saskatchewan. C. An Unusual Service The large majority of the claims are barred because they were not submitted within 6 months of the date the services were provided. The trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the physician failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to physicians dissatisfied with the Government's assessment of their accounts. HELD: Appeal dismissed. Cross-Appeal dismissed based on a 'palpable and overriding error'."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the victim had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. The victim was standing on a street corner when the accused was shot in the back with a rifle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been convicted of five breaches of probation, two breaches of undertaking, and two resisting arrest/obstruction charges. He was on an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. 1)Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, the Court was not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. 2)The accused will suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody until his appeal is heard. He will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released.

A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","HELD: The Court found that both the accused and the victim were sexually assaulted by the accused. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offences occurred over a number of years. The Court did not accept the accused's denial that the sexual assaults occurred on every occasion the victims were in his presence at Willow Bunch, Regina and Winnipeg. The Crown requested a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e). The accused agreed to the terms of his guilty plea and entered a guilty plea. There was no medical evidence and no corroboration of digital penetration. The first aggravating factor the Crown asked the Court to find was the frequency of the assaults. The accused admitted that he cannot remember all the incidents but said that he felt them directly on their skin and not just over their clothing. The second aggravating factors were that the accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. As the victims described only couple of incidents, the test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The victims have no doubt recalled the incidents of sexual penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions."

The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff.

The court accepted the plaintiff's assertion that the injuries were such that he would not recover from his injuries so as to be able to resume working at the same level as he had worked prior to the accident. It was not enough for the plaintiff to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel was sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction. Fairness and predictability demand that the Rule be applied strictly and fairly to all sides, save in exceptional circumstances. The defendant admitted liability. He predicted that at sale it would not be as likely that all of the assets valued could be sold at their market value to a single purchaser.

The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice Charles E. Haliburton dismissed the appeal.

At issue was whether the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form contrary to s. 841(3) of the Criminal Code. The only fact which could possibly be in issue was the actual knowledge of the accused that consuming liquor in combination with the sedative Librex 'could possibly have an unexpected impact, an impact which, according to the evidence the police produced, was unknown to his own doctor except on a speculative basis.

In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the duty to defend does not arise because the policy is ambiguous. 2)The chambers judge determined the policy did not meet the onus on the insurer to defend because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal. The chambers judge therefore determined Royal was not obligated to defend the action. 3)The standard by which the insurer must defend is based on the proposition that the claim falls within the coverage of the policy and must be resolved in favour of the 'insured' that the insurer contends is Royal. 4)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1)."

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for a sexual assault where there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and claimed the property damage and vandalism had nothing to do with the offence. HELD: A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre was justified. A three year sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A sentence other than a custodial sentence would not meet the fundamental principle referred to in s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. There are no judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases.

The reasons for judgment in Seacoast Towers were that there may be exceptional cases where an agreed statement of fact is unnecessary, for example, where the facts underlying the resolution of the legal issue are matter of public record.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.

The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The length of delay is 8.5 months. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8. 2) The delay is sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 3) The Crown has conceded its responsibility for the delay. In requesting an adjournment of the preliminary hearing, the defence sought to have the matter proceed from the charge to trial within 10 to 14 months. 4) The defence suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges. 5) The accused has been extremely active politically. He won the 1996 election by a tie-breaking vote. The validity of the election was challenged and he was unable to participate in the 1998 preliminary hearing. The outstanding charges had clearly prevented him from maintaining his previously active participation in band politics. He was committed to stand trial on the remaining fraud charges.  6) The trial judge must be satisfied that the accused and society in a prompt trial outweighs the interest of society in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. The balancing of competing interests is difficult but in this case the prejudice to the accused was substantial.

The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.

It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.

When the plaintiff commenced its action under the General Rules (Part Forty), it became more and more worried about how it would be paid and the outcome of the litigation.

HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember the events of the previous evening and that he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. It was difficult to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. 3) There was no evidence tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the testimony of the accused. Nor was there anything in the evidence of the witnesses who were called by the Court to be inconsistent with his evidence as to the state of his intoxication. 4) In a case like the one before me, the accused's defence of extreme drunkenness was successful. He argued that he didn't even think about having sex with her but that he did so because she had no direct knowledge or recollection of what she actually did before, during or after the alleged assault. 5) The evidence of his 11-year old son was consistent with all the other evidence adduced by the defence. 6) The accused admitted that he had been drinking heavily and was in a state of intoxication. He did not have any recollection of the conversation or of the time of the assault. 7) The court had discretion to refer to the transcript of the Parliamentary response to the Daviault case (as termed by Romilly J. in R. v. Brenton, 1999 CanLII 13930) as an air of reality."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown that was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of the Crown's proceeding was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)When the Alberta information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court on February 6, 2001, the charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. 3)The Saskatchewan information was sworn on March 29, 2001 and did not appear in Alberta. The matter was adjourned for hearing. 4)The court was unable to agree that an appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to be dismissed for wants of prosecution on May 6,2001. 5)The special plea agreement was not applicable in this case. 6)The Crown sought a stay of proceedings in Alberta, arguing that the dismissal of the charges would have given rise to a plea for autrefis acquit in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction and could have regained it by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the Saskatchewan proceeding. 7)An appeal of the acquit would be necessary to ensure the respondent's continued liberty and safety in both provinces. He was to appear in Saskatchewan on the same date. 8)The charges were to be recommenced in Alberta on the basis of the information sworn in Saskatchewan two months prior to the commencement of the Alberta proceeding. 9)The accused was not convicted of any of the driving offences but was subject to three months of administrative detentions, suspension of his privileges and driving privileges for three months. 10)The province was to pay costs in addition to the legal cost of defending both charges."

The Court of Queen's Bench is the proper court to obtain such relief.  1) The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S.J., [2000] SJ. J.S., (Q.B.). 2) The appropriate court to determine the issue of access is the Queen’s Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD-Rambler to the applicant. 3) The applicant is entitled to its original notes and notes on file and to access its original CDs and audio and text summaries of more than 200 intercepted conversations that had been obtained by warrant.  4) The journalists have access at its own premises and own leisure and are encouraged to use their original instruments and play along with the CDs. 5) The court is mindful of the usual balances of interests and balances of law and order in our judicial system, especially in the context of openness."

HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs.

The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was dismissed and the defendant was ordered to provide another security order. The plaintiff argued that the counterclaim was not a sufficient cause of action to vacate the lien and that the court had no jurisdiction to order more security. HELD: The order for security was granted but the defendant's lien was vacated and the application for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers was liable for any award of costs made against the plaintiff. 1)The presence of a counterclaim prevented the defendant from exercising its discretion to make a proper application. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to costs of the action in any event. 3)An order for costs would not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff if the security was restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. 4)In this case the defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which is the other action. 539(c) was exercised in the context of existing jurisprudence considered as a whole. 538(1) was used to refer to the claim as a claim for costs and $20,000 to be postulated for costs. 6)The defendant commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action.

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises.

The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. 3) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process.

The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after police entered his home and searched his home without a warrant. The accused alleged that the police entry and search of his home were justified because the complainant did not know exactly where he lived and there were no weapons in the home. The evidence heard on his Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; evidence found to be in breach of s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure excluded; the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. Although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the complainant and to go to the accused's home. However, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of the home, all without a search warrant. In the particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence, whether invited or not, and to search to ensure that there are no other occupants and to ensure he has no weapon. The trial judge failed to consider the fact that the call which triggered the police response was not made by the complainant but by the respondent's girlfriend doing her best to extricate him from situation she probably felt responsible for.

b_2012skqb252.txt,"The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the hearing officers is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Hearing Officer for rehearing.[1] The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. The tenants were permitted to remain in the premises until the end of May provided they paid the balance owing on the March rent along with the full monthly rent. An order for possession was issued on the basis that the landlord honoured her commitment to pay the arrears and future rent. In default of payment an order of possession was to issue. Neither amount was paid. The tenant's application was not formally before the Hearing officer at the same time as the landlord's application and it has stayed execution of the order pending appeal.[2] There is nothing in the Act which prohibits or requires the director to schedule multiple applications relating to a same dispute to the same hearing date. To that extent, scheduling appears to be a purely administrative function. In any event, the simple fact the tenants did not dispute that rent is owing does not bar a hearing hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the tenant's dispute) nor to give effect to the tenants' facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicated it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of a lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term. 2) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act and the 2006 Rules and Regulations. 3) While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was difficult time to rent the premise, the fact is he did not try because he decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting it. This decision was made not with respect to the possibilities of renting an unfurnished premises as of September 19, 2012, but was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of the macro decisions could be attributed to the respondent. 4) The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month to monthly tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. The One-Month Notice provision, which is in the Term of the Lease was applicable in the case of Morguard Residential Inc. v. Adams, 2005 ABPC 271 (CanLII), where it was concluded the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise was failure to mitigate. 5) The respondent gave written notice to her landlord advising she was terminating the tenancy and giving up possession of the premises on the 31st of October, 2012. He claimed compensation for any damage or loss that results from the other's non-compliance with this Act, the regulations or their tenancy agreement must do whatever is reasonable to minimize his loss.  6) The one month notice provision, as defined in s. 19 of The Residential Tenancy Act, which addresses a tenant's liability for not complying with the Act or tenancy agreement, reverses this onus and places the same on the person claiming the loss. It was therefore the appellant who had the obligation to show that he did whatever was reasonable by minimizing his loss and that he was entitled to compensation."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] for the damage to the floor and $4,800 for economic interference. 1) The evidence does show that a part of the moisture entering into the building was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water could be attributed to poor maintenance of polish and waxing. Although excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the subfloor, causing instability and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. 2) Moisture from the building material samples recently tested are five times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples and accept his observations as to structural defects of the building and the wiring installed by the contractor who installed the original plywood subfloor. 3) There is no evidence that the tenant waxed and polished the floor on one occasion only in October 2011. 4) There are no findings as to the cause of the water leakage but only a small portion. 5) The damage is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage."

The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 220(3) of the Saskatchewan Corporations Branch.

The proposal did not meet the criteria set forth in the Act.

The court could order that rather than the real estate being liquidated, it be divided among the shareholders in a specie proportionate to their entitlement as shareholders. 4) The Court could order the proposed arrangement to be continued under the supervision of the court under s.(f) and (d) under the powers given to it under ss.186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) and upon such application the court may make any further order it thinks fit including an order disposing of any property belonging to creditors or shareholders who cannot be found; 5) an order declaring the corporation solvent and allowing the corporation to continue on its current course; 6) and 7) the provisions of the Act can be read to operate harmoniously and without conflict."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused, as a Treaty Indian fishing for sustenance/food was bound by the regulations, and if so, did the regulation violate his Treaty right to fish For sustenance or for food? HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence. The evidence presented was that the co-op decided who was eligible to purchase a commercial fishing license and that the closure of Jans Bay appeared to infringe on his right to sustenance fishing. The Agreed Statement of Facts was also granted on the basis that the wording of the regulation to apply only to commercial fishing and did not constitute a protection of Treaty rights. As the accused was a status member of the Canoe Lake Band, he was intimately familiar with the regulations and their impact on the area."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G.

Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis, that they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking, and that the currency in question was not obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code apply to this case.  2) The accused has an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which are for violent offences. He has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown was relying primarily upon three cases which the Court reviewed in support of its request for a 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of that sentence pursuant to the s.743.8 order.

While allowing the appeal and striking the award for mental suffering, the court left open the door for a claim for damages for depression in the circumstances of this case.

She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","At issue in this appeal was the Court's interpretation of the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska.

The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable, but the Court found that it was open to her to come to the conclusion that the phrase 'pursuant to' as the phrase is used in the collective agreement was the only one that could reasonably bear.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was found to be in good working condition and in good health. While it is true the income of the applicant has dropped, the respondent's counsel has agreed that she has not established she is unable to be independent-minded. 2)A review of the Masters decision was influenced by the so called trilogy of cases in the history of Canada. The agreement was incorporated into the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada which was dated November 26, 1993. 3)Costs of the application were declined. While the applicant failed to make out her case, the Court was left with the conclusion that the agreement with respect to spousals was intendedto be final. 4)The Agreement was not unfairly negotiated or that she was subject to undue influence or pressure in any way before signing the agreement."
c_1999canlii12244.txt,"The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract. The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","The appellant appealed an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998 dismissing the motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent/plaintiff challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed in part. 1)The appellant has satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit v. Kostuchuk et al. and is entitled to judgment for $10,870 with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note, plus costs in Queen Bench on the applicable tariff and costs in this Court on single column 5. 2)There was significant delay in these proceedings and it will probably be many months or longer before the plaintiff’s action is tried."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed that the initial sum of $550 would be paid for the initial payment of $1,000 and further agreed that a reduction in the amount due in 1995 would continue until the wife remarried or died, whichever date occurs the sooner. The agreement provided that annual adjustments were to be paid based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband had always earned a considerable income although he deposes to a number of substantial business investment losses in the United States. He had been employed part-time and earned an income of $2,674 at the time the agreement was entered into. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction in his income as a consequence was or was reasonably foreseeable at the relevant time. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The defendants had planned to insure the mortgage with the federal government through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. When the mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the complex, the defendants made an application for further disclosure. The plaintiff counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence. The defendant defended the action on various grounds and counterclaimed against the plaintiff, alleging that the defendants had induced him to take certain steps in reliance on the plaintiff's advice on legal matters. In his counterclaim, the defendant argued that the plaintiff had waived his right to rely on the representations of the plaintiff and that he had been induced by the plaintiff to make these representations in the absence of any prior knowledge of his or her state of mind. He submitted that the documents sought, and indeed all of Muttart's evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. 1)The plaintiff knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to the discovery and that it was conferred by virtue of that knowledge. It was clear from the pleadings that the defendant intended to partially waive it.  2)There was no exceptional circumstance which would justify granting the necessary leave to obtain the documents. In fact, the waiver may be reasonably inferred.  3)The documents sought were found to be outside the meaning of the terms of the defendant's retainer and were subject to discovery. 4)Although the defendants pled that they had waived the privilege in order to participate in the discovery, the plaintiff was aware that they were being used to assist the plaintiff in the preparation of her defence and counterclaim. The discovery proceeded without objection. 5)Although there was no established distinction between a solicitor and client privilege, common law principles such as fairness to the opposite party and consistency of positions have been used to distinguish between the two. In the case of the respondent, he was aware of the fact that he was making voluntary disclosure or consented to disclosure of any material part of communication. He was intimately familiar with the arrangements made by the parties and knew that the arrangements were being made in the hope that they would be used to aid in the defence of the applicant's claim.  6)The parties appeared before a judge at an appearance day and it was ordered that all discoveries were to be completed by October 30, 2001. 7)The"

The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.","This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old when he appeared on the application. He had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence, which would be a relatively short period of time where the application was brought near the end of his sentence. HELD: The youth was ordered released pending a full hearing. The court was instructed to consider the merits of the application on a prima facie basis. There was no defect that was fatal to the decision regard remand or release pending the hearing. There are a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision and are to be taken rarely. However the test for continued custody does not appear too stringent as the court need only be satisfied on reasonable grounds of the governing criteria for continuation. There is also no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour. The young person had been convicted of assault, robbery, assault with a weapon and had served a portion of his youth sentence in community under supervision. There were no new offences committed while he was in custody."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The Court held that there was no evidence upon which a jury could find negligence and causal connection between that negligence and the alleged injury and consequent damages. There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on this second most fundamental issue, namely, whether the standard of care imposed upon lawyers undertaking the task of representing a client in her circumstances was breached by the defendants. The Court reviewed the cases and found that professional negligence claims advanced by a plaintiff against a medical specialist and a related corporate defendant fall within the range of issues which the jury would have to decide in this case. Regarding the first issue, the Court found that a verdict for the plaintiff was open to the defendant and that if the evidence fell short of establishing the existence of standard practice, the question arises as to whether the jury could determine the applicable standard without the aid of expert evidence."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties. The two parties seem content to receive assets mainly in the value of their car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment also provides that the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. The parties do not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It is certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. However the parties have come to the Court requesting the proposed form of consent judgment. HELD: When upon the evidence filed the terms of a consent judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one or both parties, the court must refuse the application. 1)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal was anything but unconscioable and would speculate that at some point in the future, she will come to realize how much she was owed by the petitioner and the respondent. 2)The Court could not condone the legal advice and advice offered by the two counsels but would urge them to acquiesce and seek legal guidance and advice. 3)The terms of the proposed consent judgment were improvident. There was no advice or guidance to the petitioner or the petitioner on her behalf nor would she file any material on her own behalf from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she has thereunder. The Court could only urge the petitioner to desist from seeking legal advice or advice and would urge her to seek legal assistance and advice from counsel who could clearly and clearly advise her and the petitioner how to deal with such an application. 4)No legal advice was given nor would legal guidance be provided for the petitioner. The petitioner could not request legal advice nor would he request advice and guidance. 5)The proposed judgment did not permit legal guidance nor would it permit legal advice but would request guidance and guidance on how to use legal advice. 6)The parties did not need guidance and counsel. The court could not say that legal advice would be appropriate nor that counsel should be encouraged. 7)The court could neither condone nor encouraged legal guidance or advice."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Court for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails that had been obtained. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's appeal. The Commission argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made. The Chambers judge did not allow the applicant's application to proceed as he did with his own application and there was no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. The issues raised on appeal were: 1) whether the Court should allow the respondent to take his complaints to the Commission in the first instance or to the courts by way of certioraris application; 2) if the Commission has the statutory authority and the means to address Mr. Potter's complaints about the conduct of the investigators; and 3) whether it has the tools to address the issues of solicitor-client privilege. While there is considerable litigation already before the SCC in the context of the Nova Scotia Securities Commission, it would seem regrettable to have had parallel proceedings dealing with this issue. There are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed even before the privilege issue is finally resolved. This is one of them, after all, that the Court must strive to balance the interests of justice, fairness and professionalism in the public interest."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered.  1)The trial judge correctly set out the state of the law surrounding the defence of diligence, as he was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in these circumstances. The system implemented by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by Westfair in this case. 2)The evidence showed that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, the defendant had an established system to prevent their cashiers from selling tobacco. Before the incident, prior to having its cashiers trained on age evaluation, they could have used in-house test shoppers. If the customer refused to provide identification, the sale should be refused or the manager or supervisor should be called. The trial judge implied that the defendant must be able to prove that there was nothing else that could have been done by the company to prevent them from selling the tobacco. This standard exceeded the requirements of a reasonably person.  3)The defendant had received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired. The policy generally states that tobacco cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. If person looks as though there are under 25 years of age or if there is any doubt about the customer's age, then the customer should be required to provide an identification to the cashier before they can purchase tobacco. If not, the register software would have made it difficult to override the cash register software which prompts the Cashier to enter the customer’s date of birth when tobacco product is sold. This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. A review of the policy by the person conducting the training would confirm that the respondent exercised all reasonable care by establishing the policy and by taking reasonable steps to prevent its commission. To demand more would move a strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability. The availability of the defence to corporation will depend on whether such due diligence was taken by those who are the directing mind and will of the corporation, whose acts are therefore in law the acts of the Corporation itself.  4)By applying"
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property' as there is nothing in the Chambers judge order that suggests that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The Chambers judge's finding that the remedy of specific performance was not available did not constitute an adverse finding against the appellant on the issue of frustration."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (Chisum), was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The accused admitted to consuming aspen logs from the forest in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. The logs were then loaded onto semi-truck and hauled to M’s yard. The defence argued that the logs were processed for the log home industry. The defendant admitted to transporting the logs to the plaintiff, but contended that the process involved was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. The plaintiff did not require a Forest Product Processing Facility licence. The process used by the plaintiff was much more than mere harvesting. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. It is further supported by the evidence that the plaintiff took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in its log home packages. The court concluded that the defendant did not have a proper forest product processing facility licence. As the defendant was a registered business corporation, it is not reasonable to restrict the legislation to the point that only one processing facility is required to be licenced for the manufacture of the forest product. The nature of the business as noted in the corporate registry is logging, manufacturing building products. There is a two tiered system of processing facilities, those that process product originating from Crown Forest Land and those that only process products originating from private land."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The parents sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. The parents opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the boys to their care. At the onset of the trial, the mother of the boys testified that she was overwhelmed as a parent by the boys' need for stability and routine. She also questioned the parents' willingness to care for the boys. HELD: The children were placed with the parents. 1) The court found that the parents had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that it was incumbent upon them to continue to parent the boys and remain in their parents' custody for a period of time. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in relation to the cases of the two boys who had been apprehended from their care by the Ministry of Social Services (MSS). 2) The children's continued placement with the MSS resulted in a 21 month and 3 years probation. The MSS ordered that the boys should be apprehended from Art and Laura and placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18. 3) The Children and Family Services worker who was responsible for the children's education was found to have been the biological father of both boys. 4) The parents were found to be equally guilty of welfare fraud. 5) The Court found that both boys had special needs of some sort, even high needs. The mother was found guilty of child trafficking. The father was convicted of child abduction. He was given a 12 month conditional sentence order and an order for restitution in the amount of $5,400. The family was awarded $1,000."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David no longer lives with either parent. HELD: With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, the Court has determined that it is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income. In light of the fact that the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father given his severance package, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in the sum of $270,300 when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount. The Court ordered that the father should continue to pay support on an income of $160,000 and that the mother should remit back to the father the overpayment. The father should make payments commencing May 1, 2009 under both s. and s. of the Guidelines based on his 2008 income and on his current position in the financial services field."
c_2011skpc61.txt,"The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code. The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court found that the accused was not only grossly lacking in mental abilities but also had a limited capacity regarding the nature of the proceedings and its possible consequences, and the role of the various players in the trial."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out.  2) The court found that the evidence before the court did not support the conclusion that the shares in question were exempt from seizure pursuant to The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 3) Given the totality of the evidence, the Court did not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been raised. 4) The application to compel the sheriff to produce the shares was dismissed. 5) The applicant was awarded costs of this application."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a); trafficking for the purpose of trafficking; and conspiracy to traffic. The accused had nine prior drug convictions since his arrest, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy. The amount of cocaine found in his possession was not comparable to those cases that involved sophisticated drug distribution and trafficking organizations; the amount of money found in the accused's possession, when combined with the significant amount of cash, lead to no other conclusion than that he was wholesaler of the two drugs in question at least at the mid-range of the drug trafficking spectrum; there were young persons present in the trailer when he was arrested and that too, regard as aggravating circumstance."
c_2012skpc90.txt,"The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The original estimate was agreed to by the plaintiffs, but the defendant applied extra drywall mud to the crease between the new and existing walls in an attempt to make them appear flush with the existing walls. The drywall was installed on a crooked frame, the walls and ceilings were not sufficiently sanded, and there were several burn marks on the carpet. The plaintiff claims he should have been paid for the work done by another contractor.HELD: The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning. The counterclaim against the plaintiff is reduced by 10% or $294.00. 1)While the defendant's conduct constituted breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. 2)In this case, the plaintiffs claim recovery of their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court. Because the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim, the Court will allow costs of issuing their claim in $41.00, their reasonable cost for service in $50.00 and their cost for installation of the countertop over the bay window to make one room."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application to strike the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution or compel the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. This is not matter that the file is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is one year of inexcusable delay. 3) As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. 4) The plaintiff has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanea settled its claim to be disclosed. 5) As examination for discovery were completed this is approximately 2 weeks after the application for this motion had been filed. 6) The defendant is retiring from active activity and will not be able to afford to delay further litigation. This delay is entirely attributable to the defendant's failure to respond to undertakings made in 2010. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The Court held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials did apply and that hearsay evidence was not admissible. The judge also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The Court rejected the Crown's argument that the Crown had waived the right to compel the respondent to swear the information to justify his fear of harm to others. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; the transcript of the hearing conducted by the CSC as a whole was admissible; the officer who prepared the reports was properly authorized to testify and swore the information. The burden of proof at the hearing was reduced to that of proof on a balance of probabilities as outlined in R. v. Falle; the Supreme Court of Canada set out in its decision that 'the normal criminal rules of law apply to this type of hearing'. Hearsay evidence is admissible in evidence; the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. There was no evidence that the respondent, who was convicted of robbery, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail, actually feared that he would commit another offence causing death or serious harm if he was released on parole."

Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so."
d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and assume control and financial responsibility for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time himself but would rely on the former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that such an assumption was not supported by the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact, which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. Amongst many factors, the appellant was not in an equal bargaining position with the respondent."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the complainant when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron.

The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the charge. He had a grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial Judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem.

He would be prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment.

She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with Bartch Building Movers was terminated. Her total income in 1996 totalled $1,404.44. Given the petitioner's casual employment, it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month was fair for the current determination of maintenance. If there was a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent. The petitioner must support the oldest child.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, a medical doctor who had been awarded his LL.M from Yale. The third was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of a doctor and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The residue of the estate was to be divided, with the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries. The testators' Family Maintenance Act and Matrimonial Property Act apply in Nova Scotia."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court.

The judge shall grant judgment unless (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to order summary trial, or (c) the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one. 3) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. 4) Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.  5) In this case the plaintiff does not agree with the description of the meeting or what was said by the defendant but the plaintiff is entitled to taxable costs. 6) The defendant has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his behalf and by his son-in-law on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the defendant's actions. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The Court found that the trial judge could properly find that the causation factor had been proved. In the case at bar, two questions must be posed: (1) would the accused have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him; (2) was the assault a contributing cause of the harm, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause; and (3) Was the assault contributing as an injury to the victim? HELD: The accused was convicted at trial. The answer to the first question was answered in the negative. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up from which the body harm resulted. Without the initial assault, no pileup would have resulted. The third parties involved in the assault were all contributing, as was the accused's involvement in the actual incident. The fourth question was asked: would the assault have resulted in bodily harm; (4) if the assault was contributing as a cause of bodily harm, what was the contributing cause? The Court held that the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 8 of the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice or of being too vague. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal expressly stated that Nurse was incorrect and that the courts in Saskatchewan prefer the approach of the B.C.Court of Appeal in R.v. Brooks where the Court held the elements of assault causing harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim; (5) that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of death; (6) the assault is a common act and must be committed with reasonable cause; (7) there must be a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a causal connection between the actions and the cause of death."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The applicant sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the respondent and Potash Corp. (the defendant) from producing and marketing potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the plaintiff entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's application for an interlocutory injunction restraining and prohibiting them from using the technology licensed to it by the defendant. The defendant denies that it has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles for which the agreement was signed. HELD: 1) The applicant was prohibited from marketing or using the defendant's technology. 2) The defendant was found liable pursuant to Queen's Bench Act s. 65(a) and s. 387(a). 3) The assets of the defendant were sold to the plaintiff. The plaintiff obtained an exclusive license from the defendant to use the ion exchange technology used in the preparation of the marketing application. The agreement was not a patented process. The fact that the defendant had no written client list or other written information was irrelevant as the defendant was not the only person claiming under or through them to have used the technology. The court was also required to determine the appropriate terms of the agreement. 4) The plaintiff was awarded costs of the application."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant was denied access to information requested pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The appellant had made an application to the Department of Justice (the Attorney General) for information on the proposed ADR process. Keating had been aware of the allegations and had been intimately involved in them. He was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined all of the accusations made against him. Throughout the course of the investigation, the Department had retained Facts-Probe Inc. to conduct further interviews to obtain information for employee discipline, possible criminal prosecution and ultimately to process insurance claims. In the process, the applicant was provided with information about the proposed 'alternative dispute resolution' process, which would allow him to compensate victims for the abuse he suffered as a result of participating in the process. The information was also provided to the appellant in an expeditious manner. The application was refused and the appellant appealed to the Attorney General. The degree to which the various roles of the federal and provincial government agencies became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the inspector. The appeal was also dismissed."

On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored. While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","The accused was convicted by a Provincial Court judge of having care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted him of the charge, on appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in her assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge. In her analysis of the facts, which are his sole province, to say that the appellant's blood alcohol content was between.068 and.08 at the time of driving, the judge ought to have concluded that the defence raised a reasonable doubt. This is a reversible error. The conviction cannot stand. 2)The court found that the appellate court judge did not apply the standard of review as stated in QBCA 27 of 2000. The court also found errors in analysis. 3)The appellant's ability to concentrate and his judgment were unaffected. He asked the officer what he was doing on the wrong side of the road similarly indicates lack of judgment. The officer first spoke to the appellant and then observed the appellant walking. He did not see any indicia of impairment. It is inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the judge on those facts that are his province to say, as the appellate judge did, that the respondent's observation that he did not observe any impairment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and ordered to return to the wife certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. The husband applied to have the home sold, claiming reversible error in two respects: first, that he had no evidence to justify selling the home and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the husband's behaviour; and second, that the Chambers judge had ordered the sale of the home without the benefit of professional appraisal or any compelling reason. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis. 1) There was no reason why the matter could not be heard again by the Court of Appeal should its schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it. 2) The husband's application for an order to sell the home had been taken at the behest of counsel. He had been paying spousal support of $800 monthly for the past two years. He now wanted to stop paying support and wanted his name 'off' the mortgage on the home so that he could then finance his acquisition of a new residence for himself. 3) He also wanted to return all of his personal belongings, including those found to belong to him, to his wife. This would be impossible for him to maintain the home with its attendant monthly mortgage obligations without financial assistance. 4) The wife was awarded the costs in the amount of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements in any event of the cause but not payable until the earlier of either a sale or mortgage payment or the day after the June mortgage payment is due.  5) The Chambers judge ordered that the value of the house be divided equally between the parties. He also ordered that any appeal of the previous Chambers judge should be allowed and the matter to be re-heared."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.",The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent of the children and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He drives a taxi from time to time. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. They have been residing together for several years. HELD: The children have been in the respondent's custody and primary care for most of their lives. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The court will retain jurisdiction to make final disposition regarding all corollary issues and in particular the division of the parties' assets and debts. 1) The court must consider all the relevant factors.  2) The respondent's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money and other matters of the child. It is regrettable that it has become necessary for the court to determine the custodial arrangements for the parties and the children that are in their best interests. There are no reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the parties will never be able to co-parent in spite of the fact that they are all teenagers.
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with committing an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was the common-law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She was upset and crying and asked the police to call the police. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant arriving at her neighbour's residence. She asked to be called to the police station to provide statement and have photographs taken of her injuries. On the trial date, the Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents, as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Court found that the test of reliability had been met.  1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial at this stage.  2) The accused's character was examined as a further indicator of reliability. The Court held that the tests for reliability were met when the witness recanted on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'. 3) In the case at hand, it was clear that the complainant was upset, scared and crying. She had fresh red marks on her neck and chest, which corresponded with her description of the incident and she stated that she was very upset with the accused. The accused had punched her in the neck and left the apartment without saying a word.  4) The Court noted that there were no other indicators of reliability as determined by the Court in R.v.

d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied to have evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception ruled inadmissible because it was neither a charge listed in the definition section nor section that creates an offence under the Canada Act nor s.241(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that the surreptitious recording denied the complainant the ability to choose his audience. He argued that such an intention amounts to pure speculation and falls short of what could be considered reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights and the evidence was non-conscriptive. The Court held that the breach was not serious and was inadvertent and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In R. v. Welsh (2005), 33 C.C.C.(3d) 748, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded. The court considered the seriousness of the breach, if there was one, to be minimal, and admitted the evidence."

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Estate applied for an order removing the respondent as personal representative. The respondent was employed by the respondent for thirty-one years. During that period, the respondent contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). The intestate determined that the respondent was not a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees of the respondent and the Pension Benefits Standards Act and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent determined in a consent order that the deceased's wife was not the biological mother of the applicants. The deceased's estate received no monies from the respondent. The applicants argued the respondent should be removed as Adminstratrix of the Estate and then the Estate could pursue a claim for payment of the Marine Atlantic pension into the Estate.

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's decision was correct. 2) The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and the appellant was placed in the police vehicle, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act, and in excluding the indicia which the officer had observed while she was in the phone room. There was no indication that she didn't make observations or truly act upon them. The video confirmed that she was correct in most of those observations. 3) Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia that the officer observed provided ample evidence to support her belief the appellant wasn't operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. The court was satisfied that the respondent's belief was based on the observation that he was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the other indicia of impairment referenced above."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender instead of a dangerous offender. He also conceded that the trial judge was not bound to accept the experts’ assessment of his good behaviour. Appeal dismissed; the defendant’s future prospects as a result of the convictions and the fact that he had not participated in a high intensity sexual offender treatment program were met. The court found that the defendant had not shown improvement in his behavior over the past two years and therefore was not eligible to participate in the program. Further, the defendant did not provide clear and satisfactory reasons for questioning the foundation of the assessments."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the Hospital both appealed. Appeal allowed; general damages of $100,000 fixed at $25,000; the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The fact that the words in the grievance had been published on the Union's website did not mean the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person; the publication of the grievance would destroy any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. As the plaintiff had been highly critical of the Union, its publication would have had a neutralizing effect on its attempts to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The plaintiff's position on the defence of absolute privilege was that it was based on the pressures of the workplace and would not serve to displace the union's duty of fair representation. It was also argued that the impugned statements were published in part to achieve the purpose of finding witnesses, which was not to be found in the first place."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN, applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that matters relating to railcars previously loaded by CN were not within the Proper Scope of questioning. Prior to undertaking 28, Clarke advised CN that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and if they developed a position they would advise the plaintiff. Clarke provided to the date of their questioning their position and the facts they were aware of prior to the train being loaded by Clarke. This is not an issue in the action, either as matter expressly pled or by virtue of being an essential element of the cause of action alleged. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. It is open to CN to attempt to convince the trial judge, based upon its own evidence, that previous Clarke loaded cars were unbalanced and that such evidence is relevant to the decision of whether there was negligence or breach of contract in the loading of the car in question. Such an attempt may raise issues relating to the collateral fact rule or the law with regard to similar fact evidence."
d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The parties were self-represented at a case management conference. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action struck. The plaintiff amended claim to claim damages from overhanging trees on their property. The amended claim was successful and the parties were allowed to self-represent. HELD: The portion of the plaintiff's amended claim that was struck was allowed to proceed. The court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was 'beyond the authority of this Court.' It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove the damage to the property was caused by the trees, but it was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. The defendant's request for an injunction was struck as frivolous and vexatious. Even if the plaintiff could prove the debris was solely from the sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient to strike the claim. The issue was whether the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. The appellant argued that the provincial tax commission was incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration unit in full. In issue was whether the tax paid should be refunded or not. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)In light of the new legislation, the practice of apportionment of tax on a prorated basis has been rejected in Silver Spoons Desserts. Although some of the equipment was used in the production of pickled herring, all of it was exempt from tax. The fact that it was in such a state did not change the fact that the equipment did not qualify for exemption under s. 10(1)(h)(I) of the Act. 2)The decision of the Provincial Tax Commissioner, as upheld by the Minister, to allow a refund on the equipment in the amount of $58,791 was not proper consideration on appeal. 3)The appellant was awarded its costs."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed.

e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.",This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to his treatment or any prescription he might give. At issue was whether the trial judge had erred when she found the appellant's rights under s.8 of the Charter were not violated. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The obtaining of the information from the doctor as the basis of formulating the demand was not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of Section 8 of The Charter. 2)The trial judge did not err when she concluded the appellant had breached his common law duty of confidentiality to his patient. 3)The Court held the provision to the police by the doctor of specific medical information about the appellant without his consent did not violate the officer's right to confidentiality.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an officer who has provided evidence of perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 2)The reliability threshold can be met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The reliability threshold is not met, even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of the statement is false. 3)There simply was not enough solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit, which did not implicate any one but rather attempts to exonerate someone.

Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt submits that he received wrong legal advice concerning the status of the builders' lien claimants. He states he thought the various subcontractors would be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself. HELD: The application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed. 1) An annulment of the assignment would be dangerous because it would result in creditors being paid in full much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain builders' liien claimants have already commenced an action. 2) The bankrupt has been far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. 3) There is likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. It also appears from the facts that the majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the applicant's request being granted. If the applicant were to obtain financing he would likely be required to comply with his obligations. 4) There are other actions by secured creditors returningable in Queen's Bench as early next week."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son.

e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death his company changed over to a single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only refers to the Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the sold version of the quota and not all quota sold. The defendant agreed to split the proceeds three ways. First, it was agreed that all three brothers would get a share of the sale proceeds. The second, the agreement was not binding on any of the plaintiffs. The third, and the most important issue was the sharing of proceeds from a sale of only one quota. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that the three brothers and their company were obligated to share proceeds only from sales of only the one quota sold and that all other quota sold should be retained by the actual milk producer. The parties agreed that the quota would be transferred to the new company and that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 it would be shared equally among the brothers. The agreement was based on the terms of the previous agreement which clearly indicated that they and their father had agreed that they would have joint ownership of all the milk quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. The fourth, and perhaps the most significant issue, was the possibility of a tax consequences resulting from the reorganization of the parent company. Granting the plaintiffs the costs of interpreting the agreement, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a share in any sale of any quota sold, regardless of whether the quota is changed or not."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until June 15, 2002 with the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in did not equal the amount of the advance Payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9.320). HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs of $42,089 with costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act.  2)The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayers for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, and Case Credit's right to recover the unpaid purchase money is restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2)of the Act (SSG). 3)The parties were to have a specified period of time from which title was reserved until the owner elected to pay. The Agreement has many attributes of ownership, such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, realize on security and retail sales contract. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent were together for ten years. They were married for seven years. Two children were born out of this relationship. In 1999, the appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, she sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The appellant and respondent separated in 1995. They moved to River Bourgeois where they took up occupancy in a residence owned by the appellant and her husband. After the 1995 separation, the husband remained under an obligation to support his wife, an obligation which was in principle lifelong. For several decades after its adoption, all property owned by a married couple was considered to belong to the wife exclusively or to the husband exclusively, unless they had expressly obtained legal title together as co-owners of the property. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse was equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, was revealed to be inadequate at both practical and psychological level. The application for a declaration was dismissed. The respondent was not represented by counsel at the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the appellant in the amount of $45,000 and $116,000 of which were to be paid by the respondent in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Act. The court assumed the facts to be analogous to the facts set out in their respective affidavits and concluded that the applicant's s. 15(1) Charter rights were infringed and that the infringement was not saved by s. 1."

The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused's husband was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235. The Crown tendered statements by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents. The first incident took place in August 2003 in which the accused alleged that she was choked by the husband after he confronted her as to where, and with whom, she had previously been. The second alleged incident occurred in October 2003 when the husband was waiting for her at her residence in the kitchen with the light outs and his car hidden from her view. HELD: The evidence is admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissibility of similar fact evidence at the stage of the hearsay admissibility. It is presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissiblilty on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) There is a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of similar facts. The prejudicial nature of the similar facts evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. The evidence should be excluded for the purposes of sentencing under s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. (1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharges in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. (2) The sentencing judge failed to meet the explicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of the Criminal Code. This is particularly true where the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 730(5). Allowing the appeal, that a sentencing judge who has consistently raised the maximum surcharge available to an adult in the criminal justice system, particularly in the context of undue hardship, has consistently paid the full $30 in fines and surcharges to the fullest permitted by s. 687(1). This has been particularly important given that the sentencing judge has been employed by the Crown to play an important part in ensuring that the entire criminal justice complex is consistently paid attention to. This has particularly important to the lives of the 21st century victims of sexual assault and other crimes because of the enormous financial resources that are paid by the victim to pay surcharges."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads: 12.1 a) Defending an action or proceeding against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union officer in the course of his/her duties or paying any sum required to settle the action; b) Damages and costs awarded against union officer as result of the dismissal of the first action; and c) The dispute is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-law precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim and its application under Rule 485 for summary judgment. 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. 2) In this case, the Court must be sensitive to the legislation which provides the Labour Relations Board with an exclusive domain on many matters dealing with industrial relations. The dispute in the fourth action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is a similar type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. 3) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 4) While the Union may well make the employees of the city strong, it does not, apparently, make them all happy. The Court must seek guidance from the Court of Appeal in McNairn v. United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry. This case is very different than Street v. B.C. School Sports. In that case the Court had jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's application and his application under LRB rule 485. 5) The Court expects to have jurisdiction by the end of the month."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 37 years and had two children (ages 12 and 13). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support to reflect his actual income, which would have been three years prior to the respondent's application. The respondent argued that although he did not receive formal notice of the petitioner's application until October 2008, his counsel did receive the relevant documents until October 8, 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years before the respondent takes issue with the claim for retroactive support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The younger child clearly left the charge of his parents in April 2008 and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his father. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The parties agreed that the corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. Retroactive support awarded to the older child should be retroactive to July 2004, the date the respondent received effective notice of his/her support obligations, and the respondent would regain his status as a dependent child of the marriage in three years time. However, the younger child's evidence on the matter was speculative and conjecture. It was not necessary for the Court to consider the recalculation of all child support and section expenses paid by the respondent for the benefit of his older child, nor was blameworthy conduct a factor that would result in a retroactive award."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of the fair value of the building based on his determination and application of the sale price method prescribed by the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual. The issue was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision that the sale of the mall qualified for inclusion in the determination of an appropriate MAF under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The sale verification information obtained by the Assessor was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. It was not open to either the Board of Revision or the Committee to have regard for the sale verification Information to the exclusion of other information before the Board as was relevant and not excluded from consideration by s. 172(5) of The Cities Act. 2) The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of a sale verification process and the information it yielded. 3) The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. The Committee was not convinced that the assessor erred. Nor was the Committee convinced that it had erred on the part of the Committee. 4) The reduction in the MAF is intended to modify what would otherwise be a fair value derived alone from the sales of the Toronto and Winnipeg shopping malls. It introduces an element of market value in the interests of achieving a comparative 'fair value' that is closer to market value than is warranted by the Assessment Manual or the Cities Act or any other relevant legislation. The amount paid pursuant to Document 1.1.6 is approximately $12,900,000. 5) The assessment of the shopping mall came to rest on the City's determination and determination of its fair value, based on the sale prices of the three shopping malls and the way in which Cadillac Fairview and Ontrea had allocated the overall purchase price among the various properties included in the portfolio sale was consistent with the evidence as to how this ought to be done. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of s. 3, 4 and 5 for the assessment."
e_2010skqb108.txt,"The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules.

None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

An affidavit filed by the respondent states that there was an increased risk of adverse events including but not limited to suicide, suicidal tendencies, aggressiveness, hostility and mania associated with the use of Paxil but have continuously failed to warn consumers.

The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before the court was whether the plaintiff was liable to pay the builder's lien under The Builders' Lien Act. The court found that the plaintiff's workmanship was not achieved and that, therefore, there had been a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a 'workmanlike standard'. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The cost of repair was $2,800.00 with interest to date of judgment and $1,785.00 to the defendant. The defendant was awarded general damages of $3,000.00. The plaintiffs claim for breach of lien and damages against the builder. The builder's claim is dismissed. HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to costs of remedying the defects. However, an owner is entitled only to have such defects remedied to such extent as to conform to the requirement of the client's contract, but not to require additional work or work of higher quality than the work expected to be performed by the owner. 2) In the absence of any specifications, the quality of installation was of such a standard as to amount to poor workmanship. 3) The costs of repair are slightly less than the cost quoted by the plaintiff for the job."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The accused applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a Roma and Romanian national who had resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. In 2002, the accused was killed when his car struck and killed a pedestrian in Romania. He was later apprehended and apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. He has since made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In his refugee claim documents, he disclosed his criminal conviction and sentence in Romania, which was now a sentence of three years imprisonment and his rights of appeal in that country were now exhausted. He contends his current circumstances in Canada place him at a higher risk of non-appearance than they would be in an application for bail in an extradition proceeding and he has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him.

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record.

The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of them suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left humerus. The injuries sustained by the driver were those of the two boys who were killed in the collision. The defendant's unlawful conduct was also denounced in his victim impact statements. HELD: The Court ordered a sentence of 6 years in federal institution, plus 2 years driving prohibition and a $1,000 victim surcharge.  1)The Court was totally satisfied that it had sufficiently heard from the victims in this matter. That was accomplished during the sentencing hearing when the family members, friends of the victims, and the three teenage boys gave their victim impact Statements. 2)The defendant was sentenced to 6 years consecutive imprisonment.
