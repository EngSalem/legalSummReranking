3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant opposes court approval, arguing that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should be reclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in Bankrupty for court approval for the applicant's approval of the proposal. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed amended package was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) of the BIA and it was ordered accordingly.  15 employees in the same position voted in favour of the Proposal, 2 opposed it, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed it. The court was much in sympathy with the concerns raised by the objection and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing of the application. Absent the application of the provisions in the Bankia to an employer it is clear that an employer's indebtednesses to an employee pension arrangement does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. With the intervention of the Board of Insurance, and proceedings under the Act as a judicially interpreted result in another conclusion (see Continental Casualty Co. et al. v. Macleod-Stedman Inc. (1996), 138 D.L.R.(4th) 45 (Nfld S.C.)), the court authorizes the amendment of the proposal as set out in the revised para. of the draft order filed upon this application pursuant to Rule 92 of the Rules (see Re Cosmic Adventures Halifax Inc.). The proposed amendment to para. 8.1 is consistent with ss.50(13). HELD: Taking into account all of the interests the court concluded that the pro proposal presented by the trustee did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The amendments to the proposals do not stand a chance of success. The Court ordered that the proposed amendment be consistent with s. 50 of the Act. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant company and the Trustee had placed a better position than the creditors by identifying and identifying the pension plan beneficiaries who had made claims to the applicant by their pension"
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced evidence of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the blood alcohol level at the time of the test was different from the time the offence took place. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd. (Lamp Products), through its contractor, Logging (P & E), harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as Chilum. The defence argued that once the logs reach the company, they have already been processed and that to require Chisums to have a processing licence is unnecessary. The court found that the defendant had not obtained a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: 1) The Court found that Chisuma Log Homes was guilty of violating s. 17.1 of TheForest Resources Management Management Act (the Act). The Court held that the company was involved in the manufacture of forest products for the log home industry. The Court also found that there was an issue with respect to the Crown's interpretation of the Act. The definition of'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says 'any step taken'. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the loghome industry. 2) The process was not an insignificant process, nor is it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land. The process is not an ordinary process, and is not removed from that sustainable use and health related activities. The only thing that is removed from this sustainable use is the need for a forest product processing facility licence. 3) The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The requirement is reasonable but can not say that it is reasonable to restrict the legislation to the point that only one processing facility is required to be licenced for the manufacture. This must be a factual determination made on case by case basis."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for information about the Department of Justice's (Department of Justice) counter-terrorism program. At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions. The summary of the allegations was based on the respondent's own admissions as to his work in the educational institutions and his knowledge of the various types of abuse complaints. The respondent was also given assurances that his statements would not be circulated elsewhere without his permission. In the course of the inquiry, various levels of the Justice Department, Department of Community Services and the Attorney General all made statements to the appellant regarding the alleged abuse, which he accepted as part of his evidence. The appellant appealed. He alleged that under the circumstances of the Stratton report, the Department had deliberately failed to disclose important information about him to the public. He also alleged that he had been sexually assaulted by a former employee of the school for whom he had worked for many years. The administration of the Education Department had been involved in the investigation of these allegations. The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of justice had meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Doherty. In that case, the appellants were referred to as 'victims' or'survivors'. The degree to which certain unnamed third parties, through counsel, had resisted disclosure as requested by the appellant was significant. Throughout the entire ADR process there was much publicity and media attention and the degree of trust between the Department and the claimants was at the forefront of the process. The degree of mistrust between the applicants and the police was evident throughout the entire process. In some cases, the denial of information could be interpreted as a denial of the truth or a breach of trust. In other cases, there was a presumption that the claims made against the respondent would be compensated for by the admission of the respondent. This presumption was supported by the fact that the respondent had been intimately involved in many of the abuse complaints and had made numerous, if not all, of them public. The denial of this evidence could not be considered a sufficient grounds to grant an award for damages."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","Six witnesses testified for the landlord which owns and leases the building to the tenant. The landlord sold the restaurant to tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenant alleged the landlord breached the lease by failing to repair the roof and by failing not to take other remedial measures to prevent water from infiltrating the building, resulting in losses to tenant's restaurant operating in the building and economic interference alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of the restaurant. HELD: The tenant was awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 plus $2,500 for arrears of $3,964. 1) The damage to the floor was $22,281 and the tenant was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage.  2) The evidence shows excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the subfloor, causing instability and resulting in lifting and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. 3) The tenant is responsible for 17% of all the lost business. 4) The tenants suffered significant loss of income and loss of lease life. 5) The court accepted that a part, but only a part was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling, the ceiling and the floor did necessitate closure of the pub for several days causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. 6) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the sum of $7,700."

The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. Other relevant factors include the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs. 6) The facts are alleged to support the conclusion that the applicant is guilty of professional misconduct."

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. When the plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the plaintiff became more and more worried about how it would be paid. The defendants paid a deposit to the plaintiff for a remittance to the defendant as down payment on the latter's fees. The court found that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of the mutual client's actions. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the husband's counsel objected to the affidavit made by the respondent on September 28, 2000. The respondent is presumed to know the canons of the Law Society. A great deal of attention has been focussed on solicitors' undertakings over the past decade as evidenced by the frequent reports of breaches which appear in the reports of the Discipline Committee of the Society. In one sense, an undertaking given to a layperson is to be viewed in an even more critical light as that person does not have the training and experience to understand the nuances of legal language. The applicant is entitled to succeed."

The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age.

It concluded that the accused had done everything in his power to avoid causing the other driver's injuries and that his unlawful conduct was grounds for a sentence of six years imprisonment in federal institution. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to six years in prison. The sentences must be just and fair and consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible. The aggravating and mitigating factors must be considered, as well as the length of driving prohibition pursuant to s. 259(2) of the Criminal Code or the secondary designated offence DNA Order requested by the Crown.

The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the sheriff to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has the power to seize and sell the shares in the name of Jensen. He has not pledged, hypothecated, sold or encumbered the said share certificate which would require them to be delivered to any third party in accordance with any obligations or encumbrances he may have placed against the same company. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the shares within the company is the plaintiff's claim as creditor. It is on this principle that the solicitor has a lien as a creditor. In this case, the argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained."

During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The defendants had planned to insure the mortgage with the federal government through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. When the plaintiff fell into arrears during construction of the complex, the defendants made an application for further disclosure. The plaintiff counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence. The defendant defended the action on various grounds and counterclaimed against the plaintiff, alleging that the defendants had induced him to take certain steps in reliance on the plaintiff's solicitor. The parties appeared before Associate Chief Justice MacDonald at an appearance day and were ordered to make further disclosure by August 21, 2000. The documents sought were found to be from the defendant's possession and were to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor-client privilege. Lee objected to the reliance upon the plaintiff. He also raised the issue of whether the plaintiff had waived his right to rely upon the representations of the plaintiff in the past. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had waived the right to make full disclosure and that the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the advice of the lawyer in the course of his or her representation. There was no exceptional circumstance which would justify granting the necessary leave to obtain the documents. There were no circumstances which required a waiver of the solicitor's privilege. The applicant had been aware of the expert's evidence for some time and had been advised of its findings by the plaintiff prior to making the application. The discovery was conducted over a period of time and was reasonably prompt."

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","The chambers judge struck major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim of Carry Kettle First Nation. The error consisted of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. HELD: Appeal allowed. The order made by the chamber judge striking major portion of the statements of defenceand counterclaim was made in error. The principal question was whether the imputed allegations in the statement met the requirements of Queen's Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. The allegations might have been pleaded more specifically, including more specific identification of the amounts involved and the dates upon which they were alleged to have been diverted. But without the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations could fairly be struck out as not answering to the requirement of Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The application is granted. The matter is directed to the Court of Appeal and directed to trial. 1) There are some distinguishing features. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act. 3) The applicant has no right to subdivide save subject to the approval of the approving officer, who is required by the Act to determine if the contemplated development would be against the public interest. 4) The Court is cognizant of errors in law."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for emotional injury as a result of the death of her cousin, the defendant LeBlanc.

She was present when the accident occurred, although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved, she commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It was admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover the damages from the Defendant. The Plaintiff's claim against the Defendant was not successful as it was not based on an injury suffered under the contract. The Court found that the emotional harm suffered was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect the Plaintiff, who suffered a psychic injury as result of being the victim of the loss of a motor vehicle or driver, an 'insured person' under the policy, and an 'uninsured person under contract' (as defined in the Act)."

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.",HELD: The court found that the applicant’s two bills fell within the period of time allowable for an assessment by the registrar and that it was in the interests of justice to abridge the time allowing for the assessment. The court ordered that the bill be assessed by the local registrar or his deputy at time and place to be fixed by him and that the court would then certify the amount due from each party with respect to the bill and the costs of the assessment on the basis of the factors set out in the Act.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 Charter rights by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The police had entered the appellant's home after hearing a scream from inside the home. The appellant argued that the call to the police was not a 911 call, but rather a rather rather a search of the premises. He alleged that the police entered the home to ensure that there were no other occupants and to remove him from the premises to ensure he had no weapon. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; the warrantless entry and searching of the home by police was justified; the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The evidence found at the scene was a 'distress' call, and the appellant cooperated during the search. The search was conducted without a search warrant and was not conducted in a fashion that compromised the appellant’s privacy. The respondent was found guilty of several drug offences, including possession of a controlled substance for trafficking, after being chased by police for two hours, and while the search was ongoing at the respondent residence. At the conclusion of the voir dire, the court found that the search of a home by the RCMP was justified, and that the respondent had a responsibility to enter the home, whether invited or not, and to ensure his compliance with his obligations to protect life and liberty. The trial judge also held that the RCMP were acting in the course of their duty to protect Life and prevent injury when they forcibly entered the premises in response to a disconnected 911 call. However, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and search, all with a warrant, all without which the search would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In his decision on the voiry dire, he held that police were acting reasonably and lawfully in searching the appellant home and that their'search and search' in the absence of a warrant constitutes an invasion of that privacy.

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: 1) The tenant's request for an adjournment was not properly considered by the hearing officer. The three days notice given was insufficient to allow this tenant to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 2) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant took exception to being served with what she described as one business day's notice. 3) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not adjournments should be granted is inherently discretionary. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 4) The notice provisions of the Act require that the tenant must contain sufficient particulars of the landlord's claim so as to enable the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.

Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, a medical doctor who had been awarded his LL.M from Yale. The third was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of the deceased doctor and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The doctor would receive 35 percent of his estate, the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries. The remaining claim for relief was settled in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a solicitor/client basis."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant takes the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend and to pay defence costs for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend involves a certain amount of uncertainty and uncertainty. 2) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment to the applicant. The applicant cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 3) The second premise is that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defending. It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action. 4) The third premise is the same: the defendants were negligent and breached their contractual and other duties by failing to warn the insurer of the potential for a liability default. 5) The onus shifts to the insurer to establish the claim is not covered by reason of an exclusion under the policy. The liability default is always the same. 6) The insurer is only obligated to protect if there is a genuine ambiguity or doubt as to the claim's true nature. The duty to protect is triggered by a claim within the coverage of the policy and must be resolved in favour of the insured. 7) The liability defaults are set out in the terms of the original policy. 8) The defendant is liable for costs in the event of a breach. 9) The defendants are not responsible for any costs. 10) The plaintiff is not entitled to costs in any event. 11) The court must not engage in a fanciful reading of the statement of claim to determine the true nature of the claim being brought against Westridge. The defendant has a duty of defending within the scope of the insurance policy. In this case, the liability is limited to the amount the insurer would have to pay in the absence of a contract or agreement. 12) There is no evidence to support or support the allegation that the claim has been properly pleaded. The evidence is conclusive that the allegation was not made against the defendant personally or through any means necessary to establish a claim for exclusion."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not want to specify a specific time period for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The respondent was entitled to exclusive possession. 1)Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal did not stay the execution of the judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or maintenance for a spouse, child or adult. 2)The court could still proceed to provide the requested directions. 3)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules: 1) the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v. Young, 1986 CanLII 3216 (SK CA), R.F.L. (3d) 314, but not decided. 4)It was unnecessary to decide the issue.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act requiring the respondent to comply with the orders made pursuant to the February 3, 2014 order. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation of several memoranda and affidavits, continued to fail to comply. The court found that the respondent had not shown any reasonable excuse for his failure to comply, given the snow cover, his inability to take further steps to remove all junk cars and abandoned vehicles from his property, and that he had not made any efforts to clear any existing impediments to removal of the equipment. The contempt application was therefore adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after the order was made. The Court awarded the respondent $15,000.00 in contempt of court costs and added $5,000 to his solicitor/client costs. The defendant's conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings may not generally warrant an award of solicitor and client costs, but the continued and ongoing unjustified failure of him to comply has been nothing but a huge financial drain on the defendant and his family."

The fact that the appellant received notice that he was named as a party in the hearing notice clearly indicated that he wasn't named as such.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred with respect to the nature of the charge when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was care and Control. 2)The court made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge. 3)The acquittal because of a reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it finding by the Court that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.081 at the time of driving. He did not, in fact, so accept the testimony of the testified witness. It was inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the Court on those facts to say that the appellant did not see any indicia of impairment. 4)The conviction could not stand.

The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","FIAT.

She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The wife was a high school graduate and was employed as a cleaner. She claimed that she was depressed and unable to work, and that she required a special diet. She also claimed that her marijuana use had made her depressed. The parties lived together for eight years and had two children. The wife earned $7,936 per month (gross)during the marriage. She earned $8,255.00 (per annum) as a result of the marriage and had difficulty working outside the home. She required special diets and a specialized diet. The husband was a corporal in the Canadian Armed Forces and made four years of contributions prior to cohabitating with the wife. He withdrew the largest portion of the pension contributions and applied them to matrimonial debts. The matrimonial assets were divided equally and the wife was entitled to an equal share. The court held that pension credits earned before and during the marriage were subject to equal division, but for the operation of s.13 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the pension was divided equally. The petitioner's pension was not divided with his first spouse. Rather, he withdrew the significant portion of his RRSP and applied it to matrionial debts such as the one relating to the wife's need for a proper diet, a proper sleep schedule, a sufficient income to support an education and a reasonable income level for the wife, and an adequate retirement plan. The Court found that there was no evidence to support the claim that the wife had an unreasonable impoverishment and that her drug habit was caused by the husband's use of drugs. Therefore, the court was not free to exclude from the matrimony assets acquired by the wife prior to marriage such that her pension entitlement was reduced; she was also entitled to spousal support in the quantum of $1,600.00 as per annum."

The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The parties were self-represented at a case management conference.

HELD: The plaintiff's amended claim can proceed to trial and will be limited to the claim for damages from any overhang trees on the defendant's property and whether these trees invade the defendant’s yard. The court reviewed the principles enunciated in the cases and found that nuisance claims involving trees result in damages where the effects are outside whatever is reasonably expected based on community standards. As rule damages are awarded where roots damage property either by falling onto it, breaking it or hanging over it and causing damage. Damages are not awarded for trivial annoyances unless special circumstances justify it. The tort of nuisance is defined as unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a property. Nuisance claims involve actions by or against an insurer in any situation where there is disagreement between the insured and the insurer.

The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused argued that the evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and that long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. HELD: The Court found the accused was convicted of dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i) and he should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within s.752.1 of the criminal code. The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment. The evidence does not meet either the statutory requirement of a long term offender designation or the long term offenders designation which is required by s.786(1(a)(ii). The Court reviewed the 2008 amendments to the dangerous offender regime. The wording in s.679(1) has changed from'may' to'shall' making the finding that an offender is dangerous mandatory once the statutory criteria are made out. However, the initial application to label the accused dangerous offender was accomplished within the application of the criteria in the legislation to the offender's circumstances. The sentencing judge determined that the offender had failed to restrain his behaviour in the past and there exists a likelihood of him causing death, injury or severe psychological damage through failure to restrain that behaviour in future."

At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.

The issue to be determined was what was meant by the term possession in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers. The respondents were entitled to their costs from Humboldt. 1)The respondent was granted a security interest by the respondent pursuant to its leases of the trailer units to Lake Air.  2)It was obvious that before December 22, 1997, the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until it agreed to accept the debt. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respectivetrailer was delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease. Such a clause was inconsistent with the submission that Lake Air had actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, the sections were essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which was not discussed in the section to the new Act.

The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","HELD: The Court accepted the testimony of the respondents. It found that in the course of the conversation, the respondents had made out the terms of an agreement which was to be the basis for the lawsuit. The Court held that the agreement was not in writing and that it complied with the Statute of Frauds. The respondent must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between him and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Act were satisfied. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The accused appealed his sentence and applied for release pending appeal. Application dismissed; the accused will suffer unnecessary hardship if released pending appeal; the Court of Appeal has a much more stringent threshold for establishing whether an appeal is sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children (ages 12 and 13). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support based on the evidence of the petitioner and the respondent. The respondent argued that although the application was filed May 30, 2008, his counsel did not receive the relevant documents until August 2009 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The petitioner took issue with the respondent's claim for retroactive support and claimed that the trial judge should not be blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; the respondent raised the issue of delay in seeking an increase in support. The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactively variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues were determined primarily on jurisdiction and not the result of the trial. The trial judge must be free to consider if a child of the marriage has blameworthy conduct. The parties' common interests 'rather than their own right to an appropriate amount of support' were said to require precedence over the benefit of a bona fide student. There was no arbitrary cut-off point based either on age or scholastic attainment. If the respondent takes issue with her claim, she will also be entitled to seek retroactive assistance for her son. Although the respondent has not disclosed any material change in circumstances, including a increase in income that one would expect to alter the amount of Child Support payable, the respondent clearly left the charge of his parents and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his/her parents. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. Clearly he had decided that he was independent, financially and otherwise from his parent's involvement in the upbringing of his children."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought an accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died in August 1999 at the age of 86. They were five members of the Wright family. The deceased gave her a general Power of attorney in 1992. The bank account was used solely for the plaintiff's money, there being no co-mingling of any of her money in this account. All monies that remained in the account at the time of her death were transferred to an estate account. The plaintiff was not required to account to the plaintiffs for her dealings on her mother's finances. The court found that approximately $50,000 of the plaintiffs' money was missing."

The applicant's materials are deficient. Several necessary documents must be filed. In addition, the Farm Land Security Board has not completed its mandatory tasks under the Act. HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.","FIAT.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and Maintenance Enforcement. The father continued to pay the full child and spousal support and the combined support increased to $2,000 every two weeks. The mother alleged that she had no difficulty dealing with the father directly to obtain support. She claimed that she owed $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The parties' income for 2005 was $45,807.68. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. Changes in the mother's circumstances were considerable. She received no money in September and October, 2005 and received $10,000 in November and December, 2003. She alleged she received $12,000 from Maintenance Enforcement in the form of post-dated cheques. She believed she received 40-41% of the arrears for the 2005 year, claiming that she was entitled to receive $50,000. She lost her position in the labour force, lost her pension, and had difficulty finding employment. She was unable to locate employment. The respondent did not contest the use of social media by the respondent, but questioned the appropriateness of allowing the respondent to use it. She also alleged that the respondent had a financial contribution to her company. HELD: The mother was awarded $2.5 million in spousals and child support. Maintenance Enforcement was given instructions to return what cheques they had. The amount due under the original agreement was $52,000 and it was deducted from the respondent's ongoing support payments. The court ordered a garnishee in place in order to enable the parties to determine the amount owed to each other. The administration of the debt was also ordered to determine whether the respondent should pay any more spousousal or child support in the amount owing to the mother. The Court ordered the amount to be paid directly to the respondent. The application to vary the order by court order was dismissed."
7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student who is a resident to return to the program, he must first obtain external funding. The university insists that this funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: 1) The student was paid for period in excess of two years while he was suspended. His third party funding was frozen during the time he was on probation. 2) The applicant requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. There is no dispute that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy in the future. Both parties relied on the record developed by the Center for Inquiry and Bridge. The fact that the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. Jurisdiction: The fact the student's Third Party Funding had been prepaid allowed for the suspension with pay which occurred. Funding on an annual basis would have obviated the problem. It is not clear whether the funding agency had any say in the University's decision to suspend the student with pay. The decision to place the student on probation with pay has not yet been implemented. The University has not decided whether it will seek to re-open the program. 3) There is an established track record of student conduct in the field of medicine. The College has conducted an extensive internal review and appeal process which has not resulted in a finding of systemic forces at work beyond the College's control. There has been a considerable amount of litigation between the College and the University regarding the appropriateness of a decision to put a student in the program on probationary terms. It has not been clear whether that decision has been made by the College or the University before it was made public. If a party wants to challenge the decision of the College, it must do so in its ex officio role as a visitor."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the chambers decision and giving judgment to the appellant. While the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to extend the time for the application, an additional chambers order had resolved the timeliness issue in the appellant's favour.","The appellant mortgagee unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor.

The plaintiff then spent extensive effort marketing the property, which was significantly below the appraised value of the property. In 1992 the respondent and another guarantor, Claes, filed a defence claiming a deficiency against all three defendants. The chambers judge granted the appeal and gave leave to the appellant to file a Defence to the application. The order in May 1992 was not one the prothonotary had power to give. It was an irregularity but not one that the court was prepared, in the circumstances, to cure."

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of their matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the effects of the drug Effexor. The respondent opposed the agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not shown a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of its execution, and that there was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable effect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions, that she had a strong prima facie case that the agreement is unconscionsable or unduly cruel. The appeal court found that the limits of the superior court's power in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction are not fully defined. There are clear limitations on the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to set aside a consent order, and the Appeal Court is not the forum in which to set them aside."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed by the Union were defamatories of a grievance and it was important for the union to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The Union had worked to ensure that the complainant was able to return to a harassment-free workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when she experienced renewed personal harassment after her return. The plaintiff was awarded employment compensation and general damages of $200,000, which were fixed at $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The court considered two factors in assessing whether publications were protected: 1) the Union was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and 2) whether the publication that took place would have a neutralizing effect because the words in the grievance would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person; and 3) the court found the defence of qualified privilege did not apply in this case. The trial judge correctly referred to the Grant v. Torstar Corp. (2009) as a case in point in determining whether labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation. The jurisprudence is tending to extend the cloak of absolute privileged to what has been described as'steps preparatory to judicial proceedings' but the purpose in this particular case was an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. This purpose is not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence for absolute privilege."

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.

According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence.

b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, Ingrid, the residue of his estate. A few years later, he died in an automobile accident. The couple signed a separation agreement. They subsequently divorced. In the divorce, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement, which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the right of the former spouse to take the benefit of the deceased's estate. The executrix successfully applied for a review of the Will and separation agreements. The appellant appealed the order. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reliance on the decisions to determine that the gift to Ingrid Ostrom in the husband's will should stand was misplaced. Both cases are distinguishable. A separation agreement is a contract to convey the property when it falls in, which equity will enforce if consideration is provided. The contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, is not bound by any will. It is a fact that, in the circumstances, a renunciation or disclaiming of a right to share in the estate of another arises only after death."

The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The respondent applied for an order removing the respondent as personal representative of the estate. The applicant argued that the respondent was not a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring an action for payment of the respondent's pension into the Estate. Application dismissed; the respondent failed to respond to the original scheduled date for hearing, she necessitated a second date. The applicants needlessly incurred costs on the original date because of the defendant's failure to respond. The defendant was employed by the respondent for thirty-one years. During that period he contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred dollars ($283,237.00). The deceased's estate received no monies from the respondent. The intestate determined that the Respondent was not spouse, within the Meaning of the legislation and plan, and was therefore not entitled the survivor benefit. The deceased was separated from his wife and had been separated from him for approximately twelve years. The parties were in a direct conflict. The continuing payment of survivor benefits is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to the Estate and divided amongst the heirs. Unless the Respondente agreed that the pension funds should be paid into the estate and divided among the heirs, the respondent would be forced to bring action against herself in her personal capacity."
6_1994canlii4076.txt,"The parties divorced - the appellant later appealed the trial decision dividing property between them as separated spouses. Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s. 21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant appealed the decision of this Court which allowed the wife's appeal in part holding that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licenses. This Court remitted the matter to the Supreme for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value inter alia of the fishing licenses and boats of the respondent. The respondent has since gone bankrupt. He contends that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge is nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The appeal is allowed and the two restrictions placed in the order of the judge respecting the books or records relating to Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel ""Lady Marion II"" are deleted.The respondent has gone into bankruptcy. The trial was ordered so that all relevant evidence respecting these items in contest could be obtained. The Chambers judge exercised his judgment in granting the order but gave no valid reasons for the two limitations which he imposed. The two restrictions were removed for the purposes of limiting full disclosure."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge failed to apply a standard of correctness which would have allowed him to impose a sentence of three years but for an error in law which could have resulted in an error of law as he applied the standard of review applied to the case. 2)The evidence showed that prior to the incident, the defendant had an established system to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. The system implemented by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen to prevent their cashiers from selling tobacco to a minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by the plaintiff in this case.  3)The defendant had received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired. The policy generally states that tobacco cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. If person looks as though there are under 25 years of age or if there is any doubt about the customer's age, then the customer should be required to provide identification to the cashier before they can purchase tobacco. If the customer refuses to provide an identification, the sale should be refused or the manager or supervisor should be called. This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. 4)The court reviewed the history of the offences under s.813 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge should have inquired whether the defendant 'exercised all reasonable care by establishing proper system to avoid the commission of the offence and, finally, that it took reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of its system and supervised its operation'. By applying a higher standard of Due diligence, the accused would have succeeded in establishing the defence of a strict liability offence as was decided in 'R. v.' Westfair'."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was owned by the appellant company. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed the decision to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that the Assessor could not use the sale of the Northgate Mall as a 'portfolio sale' because it was not a'mall'. The Committee therefore reduced the sale price by 1.31 per cent, finding that the sale was not an 'arm's length sale' as required by the Assessment Manual but rather a 'lightweight sale' that allowed the purchaser to take the mall as part of the package and retain the former owners as managers. The sale price satisfied the Committee's criteria of 1.1.6 for inclusion in the determination of an appropriate MAF and for the amount paid pursuant to Document 1.2.6 (c). The Committee did not find any material error with regard to the sale verification information as it did not rely upon the sales of the Mall."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner had chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The terms were improvident. The Court could not urge the petitioner nor could she request legal advice or advice but could urge her counsel. 2)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. They were content to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. The petitioner was not seeking legal counsel nor advice but was encouraged to do so by the petitioner. 3)When, upon the evidence filed, the Terms of a Consent Judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of the Parties, it is the Court's job to refuse the application. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposed judgement was anything but unconscionalable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently cruel the proposal was to her. 4)The Court was of the view that the terms were inconsistent. No legal advice could be given nor could legal guidance be sought on the petitioner's behalf. 5)There was no equality in bargaining positions between the parties. The parties appeared content to receive assets mainly in the value of her car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% of said property to be the petitioner and respondent's share. The respondent appeared unable to file any material on her own behalf from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she has thereunder. 6)The court was unable to urge legal advice nor could it urge legal guidance. The proposed judgment was clearly unconscionedable. The court could not give advice on how to properly advise the petitioner on the best advice and legal advice available. 7)The proposed judgment provided that only the 15 year old qualifies as a child within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, c. F-6.2. Based upon the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am.) the economic value of releasing Ms. Perra from her obligation to pay child support may amount to less than $1,600 in"
b_1991canlii4359.txt,"The applicants sought a stay of proceedings pending review of an arbitration award. The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleges the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain that was based on the 1989 lieutenant's promotional routine. The applicants claimed the employer had violated the collective agreements by allowing the lieutenancy positions to be held solely on written tests. The arbitrator refused to grant the application, finding that the workplace was not conducting job competitions every two years and that the positions were being held solely by the demoted lieutenans. Application for stay granted; the union's position that the notice went out effective May 10th 1991 structuring the use of the demote lieutenancies as acting lieutenantes. The Union's position based upon the ripple effect of the grievance that would include a number of people affected, but of very limited nature in the short run, that the movement that might have been brought about if those who had done nothing wrong could not be challenged by the grievance."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider all relevant evidence in making a determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand. 2) On the whole of the evidence, am satisfied that the court judge properly established that there were sufficient evidence to support this officer's (and the appellant's) contention that she was impaired by alcohol. 3) The appellant challenges the objective basis for that belief, namely that there wasn't sufficient evidence that the suspect has committed an offence. 4) The appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision, absent palpable and overriding error, and therefore must not intervene in the decision to determine whether there was a breach. 5) The evidence is reasonably supported by the evidence. 6) There was no material error or mistake in the facts as found. 7) The officer must have had four and one half years' experience as a field sobriety testor. 8) The factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s belief that the accused was impaired and that he/she had deference to the trial court. The factors were found to be reliable, based on a standard that was reviewed for correctness (R. v. Shepherd). 8) On appeal the court must accept that the officer had 4 and one years’ experience and that belief must be rationally sustainable on an objective basis. 9) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 10) The test of credibility can only be reviewed by an appeal court with great deference and, absent a palpable or manifest error, the facts should not be disturbed. The test for correctness is whether the officer made any material or overriding error. The Standard of review for both Crown and defence appeals from either conviction or acquittal are much the same except that the defendant has the additional protection found in s. 686(1(a)(iii) (miscarriage of justice) and the limitations set forth"

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests.

In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a Voice Of the Child report be prepared. If variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, she desires a Voices Of the Children report to be prepared in order to determine V.'s best interests and gain a clarity of his best interest. The variation is dependent upon the report.  1) The parents are both significantly strapped financially at the time and declined to make an order allocating the costs of the report to them. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.  2) HOLD: 1) An independent assessment of the applicant's wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there resumption of a shared parenting arrangement is required.  It is appropriate to ascertain whether the appropriate order is the commissioning of the Voice Of The Child report. If not, it ought to then be undertaken prior to ruling on the variation application.  3) The affidavits are conflicting in nature. It was appropriate to determine whether the proper order at this stage is the Commissioning of a Voiceof the Child Report. If a variation application is not to be ordered, she needs to meet with someone who is not desirous of particular answer to speak to about her own thoughts and wishes regarding the time she would like to spend with each of her parents."

He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was sentenced two years imprisonment to befollow probation for 1 year on terms and condition as set in the order of trial judge; a three year probation order was imposed. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. This was his first offence. He wanted help for his addiction problem. Armed robberies of convenience stores late at night or early in the morning are all too prevalent and many of these are perpetrated by persons seeking money with which to purchase drugs. The trial judge recognized that her disposition was despite what happened that night and despite what the Crown had said, the sentence was not fit. Leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed and in its place sentence the respondent to two Years in a Federal institution to being followed probation for a one year term as set by the probation orders of the probation judge. A prohibition order under s.100(1) of the Code should have been imposed.

b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal brought by the trial judge dismissing charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The Saskatchewan information was sworn in March 2001 but was not available in the Alberta Court when the respondent appeared.  3)The special plea was dismissed for want of prosecution. The charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed. The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for wants of prosecution in Alberta. 4)The Court was unable to agree that appearance by the Respondent in Saskatchewan as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent in Alberta or that the Alberta proceeding was an abusive exercise of process. 5)An appeal of the acquit was allowed. Sections 485(2) and 485.1 of the Criminal Code do not give rise to a successful plea for autrefis acquit. If jurisdiction was lost in Alberta, it did not lose jurisdiction over either the accused or the respondent. 6)The Special Pleadings of Autrefois Acquit and Autrefos acquit result from an adjudication by the Court that ends in an acquittal or dismissal on the merits. In those circumstances, the accused has been placed in jeopardy."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act. The plan of arrangements involves a proposed liquidation and dissolution with a provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The proposal proposed to distribute the remaining property distributable to creditors and shareholders, under s. 220(3) shareholders can apply to the Minister of Finance for payment out to them on proof of entitlement. HELD: The court found no conflict between the power given to the court in s. 185(4) and s. 209(m) of the Act and the wording of s. 210(1) in the booklet. There was no conflict with the requirement that all property must be divided equally in order to obtain return of their respective original investments.  1) The court reviewed the relevant provisions of The Companies Winding Up Act (the Act) and found no such conflict. 2) The purpose of the legislation was to provide the court with the power to approve a proposal by the corporation that would allow it to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. 3) The proposed distribution of the proposed funds was to assist in relieving shareholders of their losses from the oppressive acts of former management. 4) In light of the flexibility it affords, the provision has been broadened to deal not only with reorganization of share capital, but corporate reorganization more generally. It is just and equitable that the known shareholders share the capital that would have otherwise been payable to the missing shareholders. However, they will have had little, if any, return on their investments over some thirty years. 5) The application was dismissed with no problems."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. The report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track) supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving it to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff must prove his claim on a balance of probabilities. 1) The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balanced of probabilities that the offending substances got into the lawn and killed it. 2) The defendant had access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause. 3) While the Charbonneaus' suspicions were certainly not frivolous, the onus was not on him to establish a alternative source and this involved proving that Mr.Statchuk was responsible. He did not do so."

She had some health problems but no medical evidence suggested her health prevented her from working. 2)The respondent was entitled to an exemption for an amount of $900.00 pursuant to s23 of the Matrimonial Property Act."
a_1995canlii4315.txt,"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court had dismissed the appeal and reinstated the conviction. The appellant sought leave to appeal and asked that the Court of Appeal reverse the decision of Nichols which held that the failure to comply with s. 841(3) did not render the information nullity. The only fact which could possibly be in issue was the actual knowledge of the appellant that consuming liquor in combination with the sedative Librex 'could possibly have an unexpected impact, an impact which, according to the evidence the police produced, was unknown to his own doctor except on a speculative basis'. Appeal dismissed."
b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was put to the Court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the Court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate. The respondents had their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs. Appeal dismissed."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court by way of transfer from Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court which was not yet transferred from Youth court. The Facts Neither the complainant nor the accused were particularly credible as witnesses, each having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each had spent considerable time in jail. HELD: 1)Jury selection was exercised only when a matter was transferred to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 486(3) of the Criminal Code. 2)The Court was satisfied by the evidence of the complainant that he had forced sexual intercourse with her in the fashion she described and that he touched her on one or two subsequent occasions. There was however no evidence before the Court that any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on the date he became an Adult. 3)The evidence was that he moved from the Beardy's Indian Reserve to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. Although the complainant could not remember her age, she did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to do so. 4)S.C.R. 742 in concluding that his version of the events could not reasonably be true, nor did his testimony leave the Court with any reasonable doubt he forced sexual relations with her when she turned 14 years of age from a more recent abusive relationship and was now trying to come to terms with what was done to her during her childhood."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor trailer and another person owned a trailer. The trailer was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. The police observed the accused operating it in an easterly direction and stopped to assist other motorist. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued a ticket to the driver. The RCMP did not publish any notice of the order nor did it appear in the Saskatchewan Gazette or in any other media. HELD: The accused was convicted. 1)It is mandatory for the minister of the provincial Crown to give notice of an order issued pursuant to section 35 of The Saskatchewan Road Traffic Act. The municipality appears to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division that were in the business of hauling and to advise others in the immediate area that were involved in hauling. 2)The Minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to be given. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily, no notice was given in any media or to any others media."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory authority and to its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the public trustee who is unable to act on his/her own behalf. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered to issue accordingly unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it was not the proper party to so act.  1)The Public Trustees are the appropriate person to act in a number of child protection cases. They have the capability and competence to properly and fairly represent her but, as well, is indifferent as to the outcome of the proceedings. 2)There is no order as to costs.  3)The inclusion of the trustee in the definition of litigation guardian (paragraphs 46(2)(d) and 22(1)(b)) are circumscribed by reference to s32 of the PublicTrustee Act. 4)An appointment by the court pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 22 may not be made until the public has had the opportunity to make representations respecting the appointment or consented to the appointment. While the wording of s32 is somewhat ambiguous, in my opinion the Public trustee is right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. An order will issue accordingly. 5)Costs are ordered."

The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party.

Nothing was to be found that suggested the sexual assault had occurred at the roller rink. 2)The Court awarded the plaintiff $12,500.00 as general damages and disbursements.  3)The plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendants and the action was dismissed with costs."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been in a motor vehicle accident just prior to being in the emergency department. The emergency doctor had firstly reported the accident to the police, but had then refused to supply a sample of blood as he felt obliged to report accidents that had not been reported. When the police arrived at the hospital in response to a telephone call, the appellant had told the doctor that he had been drinking, the accident had not previously been reported, and that he was intoxicated at the time of being treated in the hospital. The doctor prepared a medical report on October 30, 1987. That report included the results of the blood alcohol tests from the first blood sample and diagnosis the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The written summary did not form an essential or any part of the case of refusal."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Ministry did not show that it had taken measurable steps to deal with the father’s anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children had been subjected to violence on July 7, 2013 by the father. The father had taken several forms of violence, including threats to kill the children and berating the mother for failing to remedy his behaviour. The mother had been unable to care for the children for several months and was unable to attend the trial. The evidence showed that the father had not taken measurable measures to dealwith his anger, violent and alcohol problems. The foster parents had not been able or willing to provide for their children and the children were exposed to emotional and physical harm."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","HELD: The application was granted in the alternative and the plaintiff was required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. The court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. The plaintiff relied on cases such as Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board (1992), 96 D.L.R. (4th) 227, 71 C.C.L.(2d) 276 and Hoeppner v. Sasktel (2001), 361 Sask. R. 219. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the plaintiff's counsel for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. There were requests for answers to the undertaking culminating in the application for this motion. The reason for the delay in responding to the statements of claim was a busy schedule and determination was to be made about which undertakings could be answered and which were not answerable pursuant to the Rules. This delay tips the balance towards the defendant. The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed. The amount arrived at in the minutes of settlement be disclosed and if those settlement amounts relate to structure by structure then those amounts will individually be disclosed as well."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

Mr. McLaughlan has properly proceeded under The Inter-Jurisdiction Support Order Act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation. He was stubborn. The respondent provides no evidence as to why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002 and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arreaars, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine he has, firstly, present inability to pay arrear and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law, Richard Schmitt, as witness. The facts as outlined by the accused on the one hand, and by the Crown on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involved in the actual incident were due entirely and as direct result of the actions the accused accused. The second question was whether the assault was a contributing cause of the death as it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause. HELD: The accused was convicted of the assault and the death of the victim. The Court of Appeal held that the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 8 of the Charter and the principles of fundamental justice but was still open in its foundation. The Saskatchewan Court of Court expressly did not follow R.v. Nurse, (1993), 83 C.C.L.R. (2d) 546, the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeals which held the elements of assault causing harm consist of: (1) the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the deceased; (2) that such force resulted in bodily harm; (3) the assault contributing cause was morethan an insignificant and trivial cause of bodily harm."

B-3, and must be dismissed because the judge found that thedischarge had not been obtained by fraud, and we can find no error in that determination.

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply. The Provincial Court judge ruled that the usual Rules of Evidence apply and that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. The appellant submits that these errors in law apply in that the normal criminal rules apply and the judge erred in failing to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. Hearsay evidence in evidence is admissible; the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defence opposed the admission of these documents. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court decided based on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. (2d) 330 that the Court decided that the Normal Criminal Rules of evidence apply to s810 hearings. The Court found that the Crown could include hearsay and other secondary information so long as it was 'credible and trustworthy' as opposed to hearsay. 2) The Crown must establish that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him and that there are reasonable grounds for the fear. The first condition is subjective, while the second is objective; namely, the Crown must demonstrate subjectively the informant's belief and whether his belief is objectively founded. The second condition is objective, while subjective, and is objective. The objective is whether his Belief is objectively formed. 3) The admission of hearsay or written reasons in a case involving an accused person is admissible. The burden of proof is on the Crown and requires proof on balance of probabilities. 4) The application to exclude a statement made by the accused person in a detention hearing is dismissed with costs to the Crown in the amount of $10,000. 5) In a case where the standard of proof for trier of fact is reasonable ground to believe, the application is dismissed in favour of the expediency of a more stringent standard of review. 6) The applicant is awarded costs of the hearing in accordance with s. 723(3) of the Code."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment as well as ordering him to serve five years of probation. He also raised questions as to his qualifications, including whether he was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision, and if so, whether he had any prior convictions. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) The trial judge allowed the witness to offer opinion evidence on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and his admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2) The Crown should not have put these questions and the trial court ought not to have permitted them. 3) In all of the circumstances, the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an alcohol problem was put in issue. 4) The appellant raised a number of valid objections. The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred or in the context of the entire cross-examination. 5) The defence did not place any weight on the questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended he be declared a long-term offender and that the defendant would not be eligible for programing if he did not accept responsibility for the sexual assaults. He also argued that the Court was not bound to accept the assessment by the experts. Appeal dismissed; the defendant has been in custody since July 28, 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults and has yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment program which the experts acknowledge is pre-requisite for rehabilitation. The Court found that if the defendant continues to vacillate between accepting and denying responsibility, he will not benefit from treatment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and to have its mortgage interest paid off. The wife, who had been cut off from her husband's medical insurance coverage, needed spousal support to pay off the mortgage, but her husband was paying $800 monthly. She also wanted title to the matron home back. The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold and have its equity divided equally. Application allowed; case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis; the judge ordered that the matter should only be decided upon a proper record and when both parties have been given the opportunity to present their evidence. There was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. The court found no reason why the matter could not be heard again by the court."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: A petition has been issued pursuant to The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act,1997. The petitioner was to pay ongoing child support of $300 per month to the respondent. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner”s line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. In reviewing the respondent’S income tax returns the farming operation has shown a loss in each year. The farm income of the petitioner, having been found to have an income of $26,900, is sufficient rental income to offset the arrears. The court declined to rescind any of the payments made in 2003. Costs: 1) The respondent”ll pay $221 per month in ongoing child care and support and the $300 arrear paid in 1992 will not cause any hardship to the payor. He did not seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.  2) On the issue of costs consider success to have been divided. There was no order as to costs."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped behind a police officer as he was approaching a controlled intersection. The officer locked in his vehicle at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour in a sixty kilometre zone and the accused accelerated substantially prior to the officer activating the emergency equipment. At the controlled intersection, there was no one else in the vehicle but the driver. There was only one other vehicle in addition to the police vehicle in the area. The weather was clear and road conditions were good. There were no other vehicles in the vicinity. At this point the officer noted heavy traffic. The posted speed limit in this area is 60 km/h. The vehicle was still accelerating and travelling greater than the speed limit. When the lights were on, the driver was able to respond safely to any pedestrian, cyclist or vehicle entering onto the street. The evidence was not in dispute. However, on the two lane portion of the highway which was closed off to traffic, the officer locked the vehicle speed at over 100 km/hr. There is a school and a playground located close to the intersection. There are condominiums well back from the road. The highway was fairly open and, at times, traffic was heavy. However the police officer noted that there was heavy traffic on both sides of the road and the Mustang stopped when signalled to do so by the flashing lights of the police car. The area was very open and bushy, with a school, community centre and condominium complex well back. The driver was driving at a high speed. Although he was accelerating, the engine was not slamming on the brakes."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. He seeks to set aside the certificate, which has been registered as judgment of this Court, on the same basis that the Court would open up noting for default or set aside default judgment. HELD: 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62.4(1)(a) of The Labour Standards Act. The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting fordefault and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. 2) There is no evidence before the Court that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. 3) The applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to open up the certificate. There was no firm date set and the discussion occurred as stated in the affidavits of the labour standards officers. 4) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that it could reasonably be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. The appellant appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling in favour of the Government using a particular billing code which indicated in effect that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The Government cross-appealed in relation the limited aspect of the case in which the appellant enjoyed success at trial. Appeal dismissed; the cross appeal must be dismissed. The aspects of the Protocol impugned by the appellant are not inconsistent with the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is not inconsistent; the principles set out in the Protocol are not the same. In fact, the Protocol is best characterized as an individualized administrative process and the use of the AU code in this sense is not an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. It is an attempt by the Government to regulate the account system. Such matters, according to the physician, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. The principles set forth in the Payment schedule are best characterized by the use by the physician of a particular account and the relationship between the service and prior or subsequent services. In this case, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so, rendered this aspect of his claim premature. Both the appeal and the cross- appeal must result in a dismissal of the claim.  1) The Protocol was not inconsistent. It merely set out the circumstances in which further information will be requested. 2) The application of the protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules', which state that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship with the services underpinning the service in question and in appropriate situations, to deny payment of an account. 3) The principles and the evidence set out by the Protocol and MCIA in their respective versions are not in any way inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). 4) In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. In some circumstances physicians have the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health plan, billing patients directly or having the patients seek reimbursement from the Government or submitting accounts directly to the Government for payment"
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment was made under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that she should not be successful in her application for summary judgement because she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Defence argued that there had to be an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument. The evidence submitted by way of the Plaintiff's affidavits and other documents caused the Court difficulty. If the brake lights did not work, the defendant drove straight into the rear of the plaintiff's car. There was conflict in her evidence about her depression and other problems she was having with her health. The plaintiff interpreted comments from her own family doctor that her problems were not related to the accident. Judgement was entered against the defendant for liability with damages to be assessed."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner has three children from his second marriage. He is the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent provides financially for the family and the parties' home. The mother works part time and lives in the apartment with the father. She is an education teacher. She has two university degrees and a career as a social worker. She works long hours and weekends. She lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. The two older children stay with their mother when they are not attending school. HELD: The Court held that it would be in the best interests of the children to be in their custody and primary care of their mother. The court ordered that the parties have custody of the four children and that the Court should give final disposition to all corollary issues including the childrens' future health, education and sufficiency. The Court ordered that all four children have primary care and that all of the parties would have custody in the event of a divorce."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The plaintiff sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the defendant from marketing and manufacturing potassium sulphate and restraining the two defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization and that it had deliberately failed to obtain sufficient assurances that Big Quill's system was efficient enough for its needs. HELD: The defendant was prohibited from marketing any potassium sulfate and from establishing a marketing business with the plaintiff. The plaintiff was also prohibited from selling any marketing or other product that was not in the agreement with the defendant. 1)The defendant had entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quills' application. The agreement was not signed by the defendant but was entered by the plaintiff with the understanding that the defendant would only use the technology licensed to it by the agreement if the plaintiff decided not to use it. 2)Big Quill was attempting to assert that it somehow has a proprietary interests in the science of ion exchanges and crystallizing. Such a process, however, consists of public, non-patented scientific principles and is not the only one that could be used to produce potassium sulphates. Such is NOT a patented process. 3)Although the defendant had acquired the assets of the plaintiff through the receiver/manager and the company no longer carries on business, the defendant has established its own company and marketing business near Alsask to produce and produce potassium.

They propose to appeal on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. Counsel for the proposed appellant advised the court the cost award was based on costs thrown away after the trial judge ordered a mistrial because of the prejudice caused by the appellant's address to the jury. Counsel further advised the Court there was an affidavit filed before the Queen’s Bench trial Judge setting out the costs and expenses.

There was still a view the appellants would have little chance of success on appeal given the costs were a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial Judge could base his decision. The judgments and orders were not subject to appeal. The parties had not taken out the order and thus had maintained jurisdiction to decide the matter.

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The proposed representative plaintiff is a pediatrician who specializes in depression, Anxiety Disorder, and panic disorder. He has been in numerous clinical trials and is a recognized expert on these conditions. HELD: The application for cross-examination is granted. The defendant is required to provide a complete picture of the proposed action, including the proposed common issues, to the court. The court has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6(d) of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that cross- examination will not result in an injustice to the plaintiff. Although both the statement of claim and the affidavit of the alleged representative plaintiff are replete with allegations that it is harmful to children and adolescents under 18 and that it increased their risks of suicide attempts or self-harm, those assertions are entirely absent from the common issues proposed in the application for certification. The plaintiff will be confined to pursuing an individual claim and will be unable to recover anything for the issues important to him."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of the product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The applicant argued that this was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and awarding the appellant's costs, that in order to be eligible for exemption from health services taxes pursuant to s. 10(1)(h)(i) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of product actually being produced for sale. Machinery or equipment used prior or subsequent to that actual transformation is not eligible for the tax exemption. The essence of the decision was that as part of the refrigeration process only, a significant part of it was used in making the pickled herring, he could exempt that portion and tax the rest. The appellants contended that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigerated equipment in full. The respondent argued that it was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)The Provincial Tax Commissioner's decision to allow a refund on refrigerated refrigeration Equipment was not new. In fact, the decision of the Commissioner to allow the objection in part indicated that the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production. 2)The respondent was awarded his costs."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving a marked police vehicle with an out of date sticker in violation of S. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The police officer had observed the accused vehicle make a right turn and observed it approach the curb. He engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. The officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 p.m. The accused successfully exited the vehicle and was taken to the RCMP detachment where he was arrested for questioning. The RCMP detachment was not called and the accused was transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Detachment where he remained for approximately two minutes before being returned to the police station. The Crown appealed the conviction. Appeal allowed; conviction dismissed. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not as taking away jurisdiction away from the officers by the RCMP. The Court found that there was no good public policy reason for the RCMP to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. The stopping of the motorcycle was a routine check and the officer was aware the accused had a valid driver's licence and that his licence was in good condition. The stop was justified because the accused displayed signs of intoxication and displayed an outdated sticker. The court concluded that this was a random stop and that the driver was not acting in the lawful execution of his duty and therefore not responsible for policing a municipality."

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding.

At issue was whether the Crown have jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s. 238(2) of the Income tax Act ordering payment of the amount of $22,069.23 to the receiver general and if do, whether such an order should be made. HELD: The Crown's position that the liability of $250,053 includes an amount of money deducted from salaries and wages or the return of money received from HRS. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was not established that the individuals held in HRS held in the trust of the plaintiff company or that they held in other HRS companies. The Court concluded that a subsection 238(1 compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order similar in nature to a fine, price or restitution order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out in subsection 178(2). Such matters were unaffected by an order of discharge under that Act.

4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and for an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The second application was granted in part. The defendants argued that there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those that would allow a termination of the order. HELD: The preservation order was terminated and the statement of claim amended.  1)The application to add the plaintiff was granted. The application to amend the order was granted with respect to the draft Amended Statement of Claim.  2)The court must be satisfied that neither of the defendants will suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The failure to prosecute an action without delay could call for the termination of a preservation order. There are certainly circumstances in which evidence of a failure by a plaintiff to prosecute its claim without delay would constitute sufficient change in the facts to justify a termination order. However, not every delay meets that mark. The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay, in the context of the statute and the legislation.  3)The preservation order is an order which was granted pursuant to ss5 of the Merchant and Enforcement Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders (AGT) pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant Hṻseyin Arslan in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. 4)The Court must exercise its discretion to order ABank be added as a plaintiff, and to extend the order by an order of this nature. The addition of ABank would not create a wholly new proceeding. 5)The amendments were not allowed in part because of the complexity of the application.  6)There was no evidence of actual prejudice. The plaintiffs chose to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action (e.g. by transferring AGT shares to the Trust). The trust was likely to be concluded in early 2015, which is now long past, and that the Turkish Bank may take years to complete. 7)There were no costs. 8(a)The appeal of the decision was dismissed.  9)The applications to terminate or modify the order were dismissed."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated.

HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to Part 1 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982, the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) of The Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appellant was acquitted of all charges and a new trial was ordered. 1)The trial judge erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he had found at the scene.  2)There was no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait before administering a test on the roadside.

d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the matter of railcars previously loaded by Clarke are not within the proper Scope of questioning. The Court determined that the application was premature and unnecessary. The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate.  2) There is no evidence that the broad relevance test, which existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules, has not been maintained. To the extent to which it can be argued that the history of these 445 cars may be relevant to the issue of negligence in loading the subject car, find such relevance to be limited. It is also of the opinion that proportionality considerations may well be the deciding factors."

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000.

The Union counterclaim against the plaintiff for breach of the indemnity by-law is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The dispute in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 2) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified under the indemnis s. 12.1 (a) the plaintiff was involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefits of the insurance in his/her action; and 2) it would be inequitable to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this application in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for more than 10 months at the time of their convictions. After serving 16 months closed custody and 10 months supervision in the community, they were sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment with a 1 year prohibition from possessing any type of weapon, except for a restricted one, for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of the investigative procedures described in s. 487.06(1) as the Court had concluded they were fit and proper for the offence. The sentences were based on the same principles as the convictions of the accuseds: 1) a sentence of 2 years to be served concurrently for four armed robbery convictions and 2) a 10 month prohibition from uttering threats. The Crown and counsel for the accused made a joint submission for a sentence in the range of 2 to 3 years, which was equivalent to more than 2 years consecutive. The Court found the sentences to be appropriate in the circumstances; 2) sentences of less than 1 year were warranted in view of the fact the accused had spent 16 months on remand; and 3) sentences were to be imposed for common assault, robbery with violence committed against a person under the age of 13 years."

The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the fire alarm system in their building was not working at the time of the fire and that they had to jump from the third floor to the fourth floor. The fire alarm in their apartment was not functioning at the relevant time and there were problems with the fire engine system, the smoke alarm system, and the fire extinguishers. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the plaintiff's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire and the defendant breached its standard of care by failing to maintain the hallway fire alarms. The smoke alarm and the smoke detector in the defendant's building were not working properly and there was a failure to detect fire alarms at the correct time. The defendants were subject to statutory obligations, including the installation and maintenance of an operational fire alarm."

He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope that he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future. 2)After carefully analyzing the submissions & bearing in part the object and principle of the Act, it was reluctantly concluded that an absolute or order of disbursement was appropriate. 3)While the bankrupt was not impressed by his poor income he was clearly intelligent, capable individual and sincerely hoped that he could find a new employment."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she not be impaired by alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in when she read the breathalyzer demand. She said she was not really feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand and the driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech was not enough to prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 Charter Rights of the accused and it should be excluded under s. 24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed the case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. All of the evidence was consistent with an inescapable inference that he was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The only uncontroverted facts were that he had dropped his son and nephew off in the forest, had returned to pick them up after they had spent the day hunting, and had fallen asleep within minutes of driving through the forest. On all the evidence, the defendant was convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and, in a nutshell, was not left in doubt by it. On the evidence it was not credible to believe he was looking for a moose caller, was being used by him, other than shining the spotlight on his nephew, and his two companions, who had been sleeping in the same area as he was. There were 14 rounds of ammunition located in the vehicle."

HELD: The paternal grandparents were granted access to the child's grandson one Saturday every second month from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm.

3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with aggravated assault, being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm and being in possession of a weapon. The charges were all connected. The accused had a Grade X education, had sporadic employment and was involved in an adult years employment as a labourer. An extensive trial had been avoided. The Crown recommended a sentence of four years to a maximum of five years, as well as a life prohibition from the possession of weapons. The sentencing judge found that the accused was more of a follower than a leader and, particularly in these cases, he was not the main driving force or the main perpetrator of the offences."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The delay of 17 minutes from the time that the police officer first observed the open alcohol bottle in the vehicle to the complainant was not unreasonable. The officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. In the instant case, it appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than a just charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short period of time, that may have resulted in a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. However, the detention of Shire was not arbitrary because the police had a specific lawful purpose for stopping the vehicle. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police returned to the vehicle where the officer was detained and he had further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of vehicle. The defendant was detained for 17 minutes while the police conducted a search at the side of the road without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of his Charter rights which is justifiable if there is no undue delay."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.",The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the previous owners had burned out their shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked the claimant to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The respondent denied having any knowledge of the condition of the property prior to the purchase and said he had no idea the place had flooded in the past. The court reviewed the law on a non-suit motion and found that most of the evidence was circumstantial and did not support the claim. It was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law such as the doctrine of merger and the fact that the claimant did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims were not present. The evidence gathered at trial was sufficient to support the sufficiency of the claim and the court's determination that the claims could not survive closing without the testimony of the claimant.
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trucking company. Gene was to take over the dairy operation. The agreement provided that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987, it was obligated to share in the sale of the Fluid Milk Quota and that all the proceeds would be shared equally among the three brothers. The plaintiff argued that the agreement should be interpreted to mean that if a company sold any part of its fluid milk quota, it should be obligated to only share proceeds from the sale and not all quota sold. The defendant sold MSQ and the plaintiffs sought to have the agreement divided three ways. The first was to have all three brothers share in any sale of any particular quota and the second, and the third, share in all sales of the same quota. The third way was to use the word 'fluid' interchangeably with'meltdown'. The plaintiff was to obtain a copy of the memorandum signed by the three Putnam brothers as part of their agreement to reorganize the company and to have its assets divided equally among them. The memorandum was prepared by the lawyer who was to draft the documents for tax purposes. The documents were signed on the first day of the hearing. The lawyer was not involved in the preparation of the documents but was responsible for preparing the documents himself. The parties were to have their agreement signed either before or after the hearing on the issue. The plaintiffs were to receive the money in the amount of $33,800."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault contrary to s. 235. HELD: 1) The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The evidence was presumptively inadmissible as similar facts evidence. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact information had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial."

She sued the society, alleging that the society had shut her out of her process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her. The applicant applied to have the order sought made in Chambers, arguing that a judge sitting in Court of Appeal Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested. HELD: The application was dismissed. The jurisdiction of a Chambers judge depends on an express or implied grant of power in a rule or enactment and not on an analogy to a Rule or enactment. While there might be particular circumstances in which a judge of the Court would make an order seeking, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade me to do so. Even if the judge had jurisdiction to make this order, he would not make it as an order as, in my opinion, an application to the Family Court for leave to terminate the permanent cares order appeared likely to proceed.

The second action was also brought by the plaintiff, Turfmasters requesting certain paragraphs of its defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The first action was originally a claim for unpaid monies for the construction of the recreational park without being aware of the 2 consultants' reports regarding site problems. The consultant had been an involved third party to the litigation, and the fact that he had not disclosed these reports to the plaintiff's legal representatives did not disqualify him from representing himself in this matter. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs of $2,500 were awarded to the plaintiffs and $1,000 to the defendant. Both of these amounts were to be taxed if they could be agreed upon. 1)The plaintiff had spent significant time and money in the preparation and execution of the first action. 2)It is common ground that the two site evaluation reports prepared by Turf Master were not provided or otherwise brought to Turf's attention prior to the onset of the construction work. The City had abandoned its pursuit of relief under the contract that had been the basis for the initial lien claim and instead pursued a different legal concept, quantum meruits. The increased potential damage pool as a consequence of the application did not constitute new facts which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. 3)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to the second application.  4)Costs of the second and third application were awarded totalling approximately $1 million."
d_1997canlii10919.txt,"FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997. The eldest resided with her mother. Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance. It was common ground that the respondent's 1996 income included the following: employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 HELD: The court held that in addition to that income, the respondent had, as shareholder and officer of the company, access to additional funds. He and his brother each own 38% of the voting shares of the stock. The company advanced the sum of $16,952 to the respondent brother and his wife. Given the petitioner's modest income, it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month was fair for the current determination of maintenance. If the petitioner is unable to find employment or income level change, an application to vary may be brought by the respondent."
e_2010skqb464.txt,"The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials. The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before me was whether the court was liable to pay the defendant's outstanding account. The defendant's workmanship was found to be a breach of contract, and his damages were set off against the claim. J. D. L. McKay is entitled to them. The court found that the defendant instructed the plaintiff to perform the installation services in a particular manner and that the quality of the installation was of such a standard as to amount to poor workmanship. It was not disputed that the plaintiff was awarded the sum of $2,800. McKay's claim was dismissed."

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. In 1986 the appellant carried out an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with the view to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people. That company could not be considered an existing jobber business. The trial judge held that the clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact, which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. Amongst many factors, the appellant was not in an equal bargaining position with the respondent."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) at Kelvingtons is a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration that it was development under the Environmental assessment Act. HELD: The appeal was granted. The order of Queen’s Bench set aside without costs. The court found that the proposal was not a development as defined in s.2(d). The majority of the facts deposed to in those affidavits are based on information and belief. While there has been some public concern expressed about the possible environmental effect of these proposals in the Keltington area by some groups, that concern is not wide-spread. While a large number of people expressing concern may not even represent a majority of residents in the area of the project, those concerns are not wide spread.

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. The parties have three children ages four to eight years. The father was involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian residential school. Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent's solicitor handling the claim advises no offer to settle has been received. HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in the lawsuit involving his claim for abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 is to be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. In this application the Court concluded s.7 of The Family Maintenance Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom a claim may be made and therefore made no order vis-a-vis the father's counsel. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the claim under s.8. It is not offensive to direct that the respondent’s counsel, at the time of such settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the respondent but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the property in debate."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the applicant. The applicant argued that this was a high threshold for a protection proceeding, and that the documents would not be necessary for the fair disposition of the proceeding or for saving costs. Application dismissed; the court found that the applicant had met the required threshold in order to obtain the records requested. The court also found that it would not accept the applicant's repeated requests for copies of the documents as proof of the protection finding. The requirement that all documents have a semblance of relevance to the protection proceeding is high, and the court ordered the issuance of 13 Orders of Production to ensure that all of the records were obtained in the manner required by the protection order. As the applicant failed to meet this threshold, the court imposed a higher standard of protection, namely, that of confidentiality. The order of production would result in costs to service providers who were asked to produce only relevant records or to prepare report or answer interrogatories; the documents will not save costs; and there was a risk of conflict of interest if the documents were not produced for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the order."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","Respondent parties purchased title to house property and caused the property to be affixed to the realty with a wheelchair lift attached to the concrete pad and operated by electric power from the house. In two years later the wife of the defendant sold her property to the respondent, who advertised the property as being a good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. A few months after the respondent acquired the property, the wheelchair lift ceased to operate. The Respondent, who had a disabled foster child, was told to get in touch with the Abilities Council. The Abilities Council advised the wife that the lift belonged to her and that she negotiated a purchase price for the lift at a depreciated value for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. The Jabours appealed the decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The wheelchair lift never became part of the Realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of a realty. The intention of the parties was a prime factor in determining whether something affixed thereto becomes a part of it. Furthermore, although it was not a finding of the trial judge that the manner of attaching the wheelchair lifted, i.e. only to a concrete slab, arguably showed an intention that it showed an interest that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the judge. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which, in the view of the court, gives San Diego a claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the Provincial Court Judge. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the Jabours on the facts as found by the Court judge."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four grandchildren were born in the year 1992 to the plaintiff. Mabel placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of the plaintiff and added $8,000 in 1995 to the account as joint owner. The plaintiff's wife was the mother of the four granddaughters. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed as a defendant. 1) The written instructions by Mabel to prepare the four cheques of $5,000 each for the benefit of each grandchild constituted a trust and the plaintiff became the trustee for the sum in the account of $25,000. 2) An almost identical situation was revealed in McIntyre v. Royal Trust Company, 1946 CanLII 249 (MB CA), [1946] W.W.R. 210 at 212 (Man. C.A.).

Please sell the above stocks at the market price and pay the proceeds to the Dom. Govt for application on Annuity Contract #69534 in the names of Mrs. Daisy McIntyre. The sum of money from the account was given to Brenda. Thus, the principal amount in the bank account was $25000. The bank was divided equally among the four grandchildren. The trust was not validly created where there was mere intention of creating trust, or voluntary agreement to do so, and the settlor himself contemplates some further act for the purpose of giving it completion."

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","An appeal of the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant was served with hearing notice. Prior to the hearing, the tenant was given written particulars of his claim for cleaning in the amount of $2,241.45. The landlord took the position that the notice he received was inadequate and that when he attended for the hearing before the Rentalman he was not prepared to refute the amount on the claim. Further, he argued he was unaware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appeal was patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the facts. The Rentalsmansman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not patently unrealistic given that evidence. 2)The Rentalsmen's decision was not unreasonable. 3)The tenants were not denied natural justice and due process in this matter."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child residing with the mother and the father, David no longer lives with either parent. Therefore, some variation is warranted both with respect to quantifying arrear payments and ongoing support. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. 2) The parties have agreed to a split custody arrangement whereby the father is to pay support for two children based on an income of $140,000 for the months from May 2009 to August 2009. The parties do not define how such Guideline income is to be determined. 3) The amount of support payable for the two children is reduced to $999 per month based on the 2008 income of the father. 4) There is a very clear evidence that the dad will not be earning the amount of $278,300 in 2009. It is clear from the evidence before the court that he has only a source of Income, namely, his new company. The fact that the mother spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The mother has substantial legal fees to pay as result of the court proceedings in this case which included an intense pre-trial conference. 5) The respondent mother is being requested by the mother to establish the 2008 2008 income so that the appropriate recalculation can be made in accordance with the order. Severance pay is simply a payment in lieu of notice. If the parties proceeded in the manner set out previously, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would be able to remit back to the father the overpayment."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The court appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge in the application to vary was faced with conflicting affidavits. She decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute between them. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant objected to payment of these amounts only because the respondent never consulted him in respect of incurring the expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. Each party shall bear his and her own costs. The court reaffirmed the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue."

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench.

Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to join as a party or as an intervener in an application for an interim injunction to restrain the defendants, together with their representatives and members, from picketing or otherwise impeding or preventing the plaintiff, its employees and suppliers, from entering premises located in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality where the plaintiff was carrying on work. The plaintiff applied to have the orders of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal continue to consider the application. The Union argued that the orders which were made in Adams did not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status as there was nothing in the Judicature Act or Rule 8. The court dismissed the application as it was not a party to the action. The order of October 1st, 1999 continued the interim injunction until further court order. The union did not file any affidavits as it did not wish to appear on the application and had not been advised that it would be heard by a Chambers judge. Application to be joined as an interlocutor by Rule 5.04 was dismissed for the reasons set forth in the 1999 Supreme Court Practice. Although the Union had filed affidavits in support of its application, none were filed on behalf of the Intended Defendant or any of its members. The Court dismissed its application to join the Union as an investor pursuant to Rule 8 or Rule 5 and dismissed its interest in the application for a continuation of the injunction. There were no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as a defendant, or as part of an inter-parte proceeding. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an applicant by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as plaintiff or as defendant within the meaning of s. 44(1)(b) of the Judicial Act. The new rule is significantly different from the provisions of Rule 62.31(1) which were enacted in 1999. The jurisdiction of the Court under this rule is entirely discretionary. In this case, the Union was not joined as either a party by an application to a Chambers Judge or as party pursuant to Rules 7 and 8.04. The only affidavits filed by the Union on its behalf were those of a lawyer and an employee and were not made available to the court. The last two affidavits were by the union's counsel."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent but seeks the return of the child to her care. HELD: The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or trial. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. The child is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The parties agree that the child is in need of protection. The Court finds that the children have been in the care of the Department since April 30, 2004. The Children are in the Care of the Minister until their 16th birthday. The matter was set to be reviewed and the trial ordered to continue until the completion of the trial. Child protection is a serious issue and the Court ordered that the evidence be examined to determine the extent to which the Court believes that the respondent has a sufficient interest in the child."
c_2003skpc139.txt,"The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n). The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.","This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old and was serving a sentence of 90 days open custody followed by 90 days in the community, concurrent. The issues were: 1) whether the young person is likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence he is serving; 2) whether there are compelling reasons for keeping the young Person in custody. HELD: The application was granted. The young person was ordered to remain in custody pending a full hearing of the application. The court found that this was a marked departure from our previous experience under the Young Offenders Act. While the new Act has been in place for over months this was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon. It was important to be guided by the provisions of s.98(2), (3) and (4) of the Act. Section 98 would seem to permit an application to continue to hearing although the Court has declined to hold the youth person in custody; 3) the availability of supervision programs in the local community would need to be fully canvassed. 4) The issue was whether the youth was likely to re-offend if he or she was served with a portion of his youth sentence in community under supervision. There was no evidence in this regard. 5) The application had not been brought within reasonable time having regard to the circumstances and provided there were compelling reasons. The matter might be adjourned for a hearing at the earliest possible date. The most recent application was referred to the Youth Court as a continuation of custody application. It is instructive to refer to section 98(4) in the Act as a review of the circumstances of the case. Section 99(7) provides for at least days notice in language that is understandable to the youth. It's to contain advice regarding the right to counsel and is to be served personally or by confirmed delivery. The criteria in section s98(3) are really limiting. The 1st criteria (s98(4)(a) requires consideration of the conditions that would be imposed and whether they would be adequate to prevent the commission of a serious offence. This young person had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue is not whether he is likely, in the current state of his mind, to commit serious violent offences."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. The union members who had filed complaints against the respondent also appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for a rehearing, that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decisions, and in the absence of such a requirement reasons are not generally mandated, the court found that the board did not meet the test of procedural fairness, reasonable apprehension of bias and failure to give reasons."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child could qualify for assistance, she was not the head of family maintaining a home for herself and a dependent child. Rather, the appellant's parents were the ones providing the necessary financial support. Because of their failure to pay child support, they were not considered person in need under the criteria set out in the Social Assistance Policy 1.2.5 of the Halifax Municipal Social Assistance Board. The Board's interpretation of the policy was correct. An unmarried mother, who was living in the home of her parents and dependent children, could not qualify for municipal assistance even if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support. She would not qualify because she would not be a'single head of a family' because she is a dependent adult and would be unable to maintain a stable one. The Appeal Board erred in interpreting the Halifax Social Services policy 1.3.5 as a discretionary right to assistance."

HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim.

The appellant contended that the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award and that the respondent challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The respondent then stopped payment of the same with a claim of set-off being advanced.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused argued that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that morning until his sister was able to arouse him and that he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society as described in ss. (2) and (3d) 1. It was difficult to understand how a person who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sex that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina and how that could have taken place. The evidence was inconsistent with the accused's testimony and his evidence did not meet the onus of the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent on him."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. The amendment was also supported by the fact that if the accused wished to continue to picket and carry placards pending his trial, he would restrict his picketing to lawful activity."

Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given inthe examination for discovery of the plaintiff and ordered that the documents be of minimal use, even of no relevance, in resolving the issues raised by the pleadings.

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under s 8,9, and (a)(i) and s. 10(b) had been violated and sought a stay of proceedings or, in the alternative, the exclusion of evidence obtained while the accused was being held in detention. The accused gave a statement to the police. The Crown did not call any defence counsel. The defence did not refer to it as an arrest. The offence was committed against the accused when he was 'un-arrested'. The accused's detention after the purported 'de facto' arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge of assault and the accused did not have a right to retain and instruct counsel. 1)The accused's continued detention after he was “un-arranged” (i) constituted ade facto arrest and his continued detention (ii) amounted to a violation of his rights under the Charter.  2)The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported un-arrrest (i), and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the Crown were in error in that finding, his continued detentions after the purportedly 'dejure' (i.e. non-arrival) constituteda de facto' arrested as described by Latimer (ii). The accused has not established that he was subject to 'de jure' arrest (iii) or (iv) any reasonable search or seizure resulting in a violation thereof.  3)There are several ways to contact a particular Legal Aid person by telephone or by fax.

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed.

It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA.

c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order (which was amended on a couple of occasions) for the investigation of the securities of Knowledge House Inc.

The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's. The Commission seeks leave to appeal. The underlying judicial review application should not at this stage be dismissed or stayed on the basis that certiorari is never available to attack an investigation by an administrative agency. The court must strive to balance the interests of the public and the integrity of the judicial process. To do so requires a balancing of the competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and of the specific circumstances of the case. The applicant is a person directly affected by the commission's investigation orders and, in particular, by the way the investigation authorized by those orders has been conducted. The commission is in the best position and has the statutory discretion to perform that balancing. Its decisions in this area are entitled to judicial deference."

HELD: The appeal is taken on the following ground: Judge failed to give proper legal effect to evidence that did not know there was problem until came out of the store was confronted by the owner of the car. The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he did know had happened prior to returning from the store. There was no palpable or overriding error."

HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing. It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held in open court. The Crown and the accused argued that the conference should not be open to the public or the media. Application allowed; portions of the original decision obtained as a result of the application allowed to be viewed; portions were removed as the court sought to rebut the open court principle and support an order pursuant to s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act; and portions were allowed as a matter of urgency to allow the public to participate. The court found that the evidence gathered was credible, substantial and well grounded in the evidence; and the salutary effects of the order, including the effects on the rights and interests of the accused and her supporters, were outweighing the benefits to the general public."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975.

The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband continued to pay $1,000 per month.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application is twofold. Firstly the bankrupt received misinformation or had amisunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to apply for an order declaring bankruptcy which would result in the bankrupting of his trustee and the creditors being paid in full much more expeditiously than would otherwise take. Certain of the builders' liien claimants had already commenced an action. 2)There was evidence that prior to bankruptcy the bankrupt attempted to deal with his financial problem through the orderly payment of debts but found out on an informal basis that it would be defeated. There was likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. The majority of secured creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the repayment of the loan. 3)There were other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early as next week."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue is whether the Agreement is a lease or a security agreement. The central issue is between the parties whether the agreement is a leasing or security agreement; whether the trade-in as the advance payment does not appear to be a nominal amount but the Agreement does not define it in that way. The value of the trade in does not equal the amount of advance payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9,320.67). HELD: The claim is dismissed. The defendant is awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1) The Agreement has many of the attributes of a lease, but the agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement are a question of law. 2) The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest in a sprayer, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. There is no evidence as to the value at the end of five years (June, 2002) that would depend upon market fluctuations. To validate the early repossession in these circumstances would defeat the intention of the legislation to afford protection to farmers against loss of property without compliance with legislative provisions by creditors who are governed by the Act. The Agreement is not a lease nor is it covered by the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. Only if the Agreement was lease and is not covered by The Saskatchewan Farm security Act would the defendant be released from all liability with respect to the sprayers under s.55 of the Act but would not go further. The issue was not plead in defence but rather in the framework of a summary trial. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in the circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of a spray cooler at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s55(c) of the Farm Security act.  3) The defendant was awarded costs of $42,089.00 with the plaintiff's claim dismissed."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The Chambers judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's ultimate remedy should lie in damages as opposed to specific performance and urged the respondent to file its statement of defence and proceed to resolution without further delay. The order was immediately registered in January 2007 and the appellant’s miscellaneous Interest was discharged from title. The appeal is dismissed with costs. The registration of a miscollegious interest is analogous to the registration of caveat protecting an interest under the former Land Titles Act. The principles of the common law apply. The respondent had not filed a statement of defense at the time it made the application, and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."

HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","HELD: The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. The victim surcharges are mandatory under ss. 737(5) and (6). The sentencing judge waived the surcharge for an offence of failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to attend and complete an anger management program as required by a probation order made September 14, 2005. The respondent was sentenced to a fine of $200 and placed on probation for a period of 1 year. Among other things, the probation terms require the respondent to partake in anger management programming. As he concluded the sentencing hearing, and without any discussion or explanation, the sentencing judge wahed the victim fee. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: 1) The victim fine surcharge is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 730 of the Criminal Code. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim- surcharge, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons. 2) The sentencing Judge failed to comply with s 737(1) or the explicit provisions of ss 737(6) or (6)). 3) He has consistently and consistently raised the maximum amount of money that can be paid by an offender under the S. 737. Allowing the appeal, that although the maximum surcharge of $30 may be paid in some circumstances, this is not the case here. The maximum amount is 15 per cent. The entire system of sentencing and fines is varied in accordance with the circumstances. This is particularly true where the maximum number of days is 21 days. 4) There is evidence to support the findings of fact finding that the maximum sentence for an assault on a young person under S. 15 is a maximum of 21 years. This reflects the fact that the entire criminal justice system, including the sentencing judges, is dominated by the use of surcharges."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial court considered the facts. The trial judge’s decision was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 2)There was no evidence of what the appellant was wearing at the time of the stop. The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn’t make observations or truly act upon them. The subjective element in determining whether she had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample is not present. 3)The evidence was not conclusive. The bloodshot eye and slurred speech were all indicia which the officer’d been aware of prior to making the demand. Even excluding the slurring speech and bloodshot Eyes, the remaining indicia were ample evidence to support her belief the appellant had operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 4)The court found that the respondent had reasonable, probable and reasonable grounds to demand a sample of her breath and her claim for breach of the Charter must fail. The court found with respect to the issues of appeal that: 1)the trial judge erred in finding that the police officer did not have unreasonable and probable reasons to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and in excluding such evidence pursuant to s8, or 10(b). The court also found that in coming to the conclusion that the trial officer placed a new unreasonable search and seizure device on the respondent after the vehicle arrived at the police vehicle at 12:04 a.m.  5)The respondent admitted she did not know what type of footwear he was wearing.

5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and breach of his section 7 rights. The police officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation and for failing to report the accident. The accused was detained by the police while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. The voir dire was held on the admissibility of statements made to the police officer after the arrest. The defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence that was obtained by a breach of the accused’s s. 7 rights and was self- incriminating, the admission of such statements would be unfair to the accused. All statements made following the arrest were excluded. Statements given after the offence were also excluded. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC, 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321 and Stillman (1997), 113 C;C.Ct. (3d); 321. The officer was acting in good faith when he was interrogating the accused after he had arrested him, explained what he was doing, explained his rights to counsel and further warned him that he was not obligated to say anything further to the officer. He was cooperative throughout. The statements made after arrest were self-incriminating and conscriptive."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. The appeal court also found that in light of the exchange at the pre-charge conference, the trial court erred in law in not giving a warning to both witness. Although the witness's testimony may have been tainted by misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence, the court found no error of law on the part of the judge in refusing to give the warning to the witness."

The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost of $20,000 on the basis that the counterclaim was not a valid lien, the respondent failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The plaintiff counterclaimed for services and materials. The respondent then engaged a different subcontractor to complete the work. HELD: The order for security for the costs was granted. The matter was determined to be wholly distinct from the plaintiff's claim and therefore not wholly distinct. The presence of a counterclaim did not preclude an order for costs.  1)The defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99) wherein $50k is posted as security for Costs. The amount in that action is $4,000 and is equal to the total cost of the action ($1,460,246.10). 2)The plaintiff commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. It is reasonable to expect that the claim is a separate claim from the claim. The fact that the plaintiff raised its claim by way of counterclaims to the other two actions did not disqualify it. 3)An order requiring security for damages will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff if the security is restricted to the costs for the defence of the claim proper. This approach does not result in the plaintiff funding the defendant's counterclaim, although it can be said that this is being done through the posting of security in the other action. In any event, the matter is raised by the respondent in many respects as a separate action. 4)Costs in the cause of the application were awarded in the sum of $12,000 to the plaintiff."

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

The accused was prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. The fire arms were prohibited from being used in the offence and there were no penile penetration allegations.

Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate.

In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable.

The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska was 'patently unreasonable'. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere with the decision by the Board unless it was patently unreasonable. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable. Allowing the appeal, that the appeal is dismissed. The Chambers judge's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question was a perfectly rational one. It was not irrational for the Chambers judge to conclude that the phrase 'pursuant to' as the phrase is used in the collective agreement was the only one that the words of the agreement could reasonably bear.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the appellant, Farm Credit Canada (hereafter 'the R.M.'), even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent.

HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent obtained priority over the appellant's mortgage by virtue of the filing of a caveat. 2) The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the appellant. 3) Up to the time the respondent had agreed to the payment of all amounts required to be paid under the Grant Agreement and the performance of all of the Corporation's obligations under the instrument itself, the appellant had an interest in the mortgaged land in priority to the interest of the applicant. 4) The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $150,000. 5) The Supreme Court disagreed on the following analysis."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The purpose of the order was to protect their reputation and to allow the Maintenance Enforcement Program to find a payor of spousal or child support or to issue garnishment against wages or income tax refunds, or to suspend driving privileges. The parties sought exclusion of the public on the date of the hearing and a publication ban. The applicant and respondent sought to keep the documents in their file private. They argued that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft. The sufficiency of the arguments advanced by the applicants and the respondent in opposing the publication of the file did not provide any factors that were to be considered in the exercise of the discretion provided. HELD: The applications were granted. The salutary effects of a sealing order do not outweigh its deleterious effects in the circumstances. There is a social value to be derived from the public expectation of privacy and confidentiality for personal identifiers and the risk of identity theft is real. However, there is no general principle at stake in establishing a public interest in preserving confidential information. The present system of court procedures is designed to protect the public's expectation that personal identifiers will be kept private and confidential. To ensure that this is done with respect to all personal identifiers, the court must consider the factors set out in the jurisprudence and the history of the practice."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicates it is for a fixed term of one year from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on a month to month basis. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term is not reasonable within the meaning of that section and the landlord was legally disowned to compensate for that loss. 2) While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was difficult time to rent the premise, the fact is he did not try because he decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting it. This decision was made not with respect to the possibilities of renting an unfurnished premises as of September 19, 2012 but was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent. 3) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The Residential Tenancy Agreement and the 2006 Rules. The Hearing Officer erred in holding that the fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the Term of the Lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a Month to Month tenancy following the end of the fixedTerm. 4) The onus is on the defendant to establish a failure to mitigate on the part of the plaintiff."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or for the purpose of breaching his Treaty right to fish for sustenance. The accused argued the wording of the letters was bound by s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The co-op decided to open the area to commercial and recreational fishing, and the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The issue was whether the co-operative was bound or was not bound by the regulations. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge and was given time to reply to questions from the Court as to his recollection of the evidence and legislative provisions presented before the Court.

It was a direct evidence that he wasn't at the Eureka Club at that time. 2)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry (eight months after the robbery) nor at trial (eleven months after) to be a reason to suspect or reject his evidence was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate alibi by perjury. 3)The evidence drawn from the letter admitted that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982. The adverse inference was drawn against the accused based on his failure to provide an alibis that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up. 4)The allegation that the accused fabricated the evidence was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence drawn as a whole was pure speculation and was not intended to be proven. 5)The only conclusion drawn was that the letter was an honest attempt to deceive and that it gave rise to an adverse inference.

The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there has been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: $3,000 per month in spouse support under the interspousal contract 1999. Under that agreement the husband pays $5,000 a month. Under the agreement the wife is residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. HELD: An increase is warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal and support will be varied to $3 million per month and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. The wife will have costs fixed in the amount of $1,000."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. They had two children out of this relationship. After separation, the appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. The respondent and the appellant separated in 1995. The appellant applied under the Family Maintenance Act seeking a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the MPA. In addition to the respondent, she gave notice of the application to both the federal and provincial Crown. The federal Crown did not appear. The provincial Crown appeared and made representations. The AG of NS opposed the application. At issue was whether the characteristic of being unmarried of not having contracted a marriage in manner recognized by the state in the fashion of one's choice constituted a ground of discrimination within the ambit of s. 15(1). HELD: The application was dismissed. The court adopted the reasoning of the Chambers judge in reviewing the application and found that the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada was not analogous to that of the Crown in that it did not challenge the prima facie basis for an analogous decision. The Court held that the respondent's position on the issue was not supported by the facts set out in her affidavits. It was not necessary to justify the denial of benefit based on the presumption of a similar status quo."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys had special needs and were developmentally delayed. Their mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the grandsons to their care, alleging that they were sexually assaulted and that they did not masturbate in front of their children. Although the boys had been exposed to some crude sexual activity, the Court found that the evidence showed that the accused did not pose a risk to his children. The Court determined that the boys should be apprehended from the parents' care and placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18. HELD: 1) The children were placed with the parents. They were to remain at the Stevens home until they were adopted. 2) The Court held that it was incumbent upon the parents to look firstly at s.37(1) which requires a determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the Minister for a temporary period of time. 3) The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. The 1987 conviction was not the last brush with the law. The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. The current foster parents are working and living in a therapeutic foster home. They have seven children, ages 8, and 11. All the children have some form of protection, even those with special needs. There is a risk that one of the children may be sexually assaulted or sexually assaulted by the parents once he begins grade two of his school years. The family has been advised that this could happen again. 4) The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry of social services (FS) concerns for Michael and David were found to be another judicial error. It is not necessary to remind the Court that it has a moral and legal duty to ensure that children are placed in such a foster home as to meet their needs and to provide a stable, stable and stable environment for their children to come to. 5) In the circumstances of this case the Court is of the view that an adoption plan is unlikely due to reasons such as the age at which the child is born or other circumstances. The Family Service worker has demonstrated that she has the skills to do that. The Children's Services worker has been in the family for five years and has taken the necessary courses to be deemed a'special interest' foster parent. She has been consistently consistent in"
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking; 2) he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues and was qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the offences for which he was being found guilty; and 3) he had nine prior drug convictions, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic, which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary. The Court found that these circumstances justified the maximum credit allowed pursuant to s. 719(3.1) of the Code. The accused was given credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent on remand and 24 days credit for the time he was in custody. The amount involved was $16,325.98 which was transferred to the accused’s lawyer at his request to pay his legal fees. The court considered this to have a significant impact upon the sentence as it was a sentence in the range of years to 30 months with a long period of probation to assist the accused in overcoming his drug addiction. There were few mitigating circumstances that the court could and should properly take into account in reaching its sentencing decision."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not shown a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The fact that the petitioner was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application for variation. There was also no evidence that he bore the onus to prove there was a change in circumstance sufficient to warrant variation in child support. The petitioner was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support and ordered to reapply for variation in the order of custody. Child Support and Arrears: 1)The respondent had been in the custody of his mother for the past six years. His principal residence was with her and was closely located to her collegiate and circle of friends. It was clear that his best interests required that the status quo be continued. 2)The petitioner was not a candidate for joint custody and shared parenting. Both parents were in fact candidates to be the custodians of the child. 3)The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute material change of circumstance relevant to the custody application. The 35 year old petitioner should not be made to feel obligated to spend more time with her parents. Nor should the natural growth of the 15-year old child toward independence be misconstrued as sign of disaffection. 4)The applicant was awarded the costs of the application."

d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown has made an application to have first statements made to her neighbour and to the police admitted as an example of a principled basis, the governing principles being reliability and necessity. The facts are straightforward. The complainant is the common- law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She was the common law spouse for whom she lived in an apartment building next door to the accused's daughter. The parties knew the complainant for about 10 years and had known her for five or six years. They had an argument over a bank card. During this dispute, the accused put his hands on her neck in an attempt to strangle her. She tipped over and tipped over again. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant arriving home. She asked that the police be called. The officers responded by calling the police. They met with the complainant's mother, sister-in-law, friend and her boyfriend. The court found that the first statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to friend without any apparent guile and the accused demonstrated that he had no motive to lie, she had no recollection of the assault, she was upset and crying and had a physical mark consistent with an assault and she stated that the accused had punched her. The accused's subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour was found to be a further indicator of reliability."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD-RROM because the defendant entered a guilty plea. Now, the journalists wish to hear that evidence. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant that it must apply to the Crown for an order to obtain access. HELD: The appropriate court to determine the issue of access is the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release theCD-ROM to the applicant. The court is the appropriate court for such relief.  1) The presumption in favour of public access and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. Such as the fact that the trial in Nova Scotia was a factor in the applicant's application. 2) The applicant was granted the opportunity to use its devices and to access its original recordings and audio and text summaries of more than 200 intercepted conversations that had been obtained by warrant. Both counsel agreed that the appropriate Court to determine access to the CDROM was the Queen’s Bench.  3) The court reviewed McIntyre v. Nova Scotia and Leader-Post v. Neuls and considered R. v. S.J.S. at para. 8. The governing principle is that there is a presumption in favor of publicaccess but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. This is a hallmark of openness in our judicial system. McIntyre was the appropriate venue to obtain such relief and Leader Post v.Neuls was another case in which the presumption is in favour, in favour and in need of a consistent and consistent maintenance of the public trust, was the proper forum for this type of application. The appropriate Court is Queen”s Bench in the province of Nova Scotia."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act (CFSA) and that an indefinite order for custody was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties had been able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child’d needs, which was not in the Court‘s best interests. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of stability that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future."
c_2012skpc90.txt,"The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The plaintiffs claim their damages are set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. The defendant denies his workmanship was poor. He states he performed portion of the work but was not allowed to finish the job. The plaintiff alleges he suffered burn marks on the carpet, the backsplash, the ceiling and the walls and he is entitled to judgment against the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,342.00 for the damage assessment. The defendants claim their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court. Because the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim, the court will allow the cost to issuing their claim in the amounts of $41, $50 and their reasonable cost for service to be $50. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs are entitled to judgments against the defendant in amount of approximately $5,975.95 for the plaintiff's unpaid work.  2) The defendant is entitled by the plaintiffs to judgment in an unspecified amount for the damages claimed. The claim for punitive damages is that they hired the defendant to complete the work in a workmanlike manner. Because of the number of burn marks, it was not possible to match the existing laminate with new, if he tried to patch it, the countertop needed to be replaced. 3) While the defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damage is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed. They are confined to exceptional cases where he's committed a breach, such as the damage done to the plaintiffs' property after the defendant was terminated, the defendant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that the damage has been caused or that the plaintiffs sustained loss of income as a result of their cleaning efforts.

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a count of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; an order under ss. 7 and 24(1), of the Charter of Rights and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictments as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer, and alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the Crown was not bound by the findings of the trial judge in Schafer but preferred to await the outcome of that trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial. The application to quash a count was substantively the same question as that considered and determined adversely to the applicant first by Judge Goldstein, then by Matheson J.

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; that the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The evidence established that the defendants were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. HELD: 1) The evidence was that some 700 plants of marijuana were being grown on the accused's property. 2) The accused's residence was being used for only the following permitted use (the 'Permitted Use'): Agricultural/medical use, and medical use. 3) There was no evidence that any of the accused’s children or any of their relatives were involved. 4) The court held that the evidence of the four accused was not believed beyond the fact that they were living on the property and had no contact with their neighbours. 5) The Court did not accept the evidence that the foursome was involved in a conspiracy to obtain marijuana plants for their benefit. The court found that all of the evidence pointing to the conspiracy was not supported by the evidence as a whole. The foursome were found in possession of marijuana plants. 6) The Crown challenged the veracity of the three accused”s evidence.

He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter. It is therefore not appealable.","This was an appeal from a decision wherein the trial judge declared a mistrial and set a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record that contained the individual weighing of each set of wheels on the accused tandem axle truck.

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving.

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

He was not drinking on the occasion and he did not have any friends or associates. He had been drinking.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","HELD: The Court found that both the accused and the complainant were sexually assaulted by the accused. The Court accepted that the accused touched the victims on their skin and not just over their clothing, and that there was digital penetration by both victims. There was no medical evidence and no corroboration of digital penetration. The accused testified that he never did it as she described, the golf course incident never happened; he never exposed his penis. The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. The first aggravating factor the Crown asked the Court to find was the frequency of the assaults. The defence argued that due to the fraility of the victims’ memory the Court was not able to find that the sexual assaults occurred on every occasion the accused was in his presence at Willow Bunch, Regina and Winnipeg. The second aggravating factors the Crown sought to find were: 1) that the victims described only couple of incidents when this occurred, but the test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The victims had no doubt recalled the incidents of digital Penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions. The evidence established that the abuse occurred over several years, many times. The defendant got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The offences occurred over a number of years. The Criminal Code requires that all incidents of sexual assault be investigated and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This finding is supported by the rest of the evidence. The victim described only one incident in particular, which was a basement incident. The complainant described feeling and rubbing the girls under their clothes, and kissing them hard on the mouth and lips, and the accused described how often he put his hand inside her pants and rubbed her breast and vaginal area. The court was satisfied that both victims described just one incident when the alleged offences occurred. As the victims got older and the defendant became bolder, he went to feeling and touching the girls and touching them under their clothing and kissing and touching their bodies and their bodies, and physical contact was common on occasion. The two victims who testified testified that they experienced physical or sexual abuse over a period of time, and they all had the same first impression of the accused: his hands were warm, he rubbed his penis against them, he touched the girls' skin and touched their breasts, his penis was erect and he rubbed their vaginal area with his hand. The alleged digital penetration did not occur on all of the occasions."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the mortgage draws by one of the two mortgage brokers, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws in a particular manner. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff sought postponements of two irrevocable letters of direction in order to permit sufficient funds to be paid in due course. The first mortgageee, the lawyer retained by the plaintiff, had disbursed funds contrary to the first letter of direction but that he was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the second letter and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement. Both the plaintiff and the first mortgage buyer, who were suppliers and creditors to the construction project, now sued the plaintiff claiming that he disordered a mortgage advance of $78,400 paid to two mortgagebrokers and that the plaintiff was negligent to comply with his written directions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff's conduct throughout his retainer as solicitor for the project was one of conscientiousness and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through various irrevocables letters of directions.  2)Although the plaintiff's claims have been separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of undertaking, the subsequent issues of knowledge, reliance and causation render it appropriate to consider the various issues raised in the plaintiffs' claim together. Any claim under a breach of trust is not likely to succeed on this ground. 3)There was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiff."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The evidence was conclusive that the accused had a long record of criminal offences, including 57 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. The evidence showed that the most aggravating factors to be considered were the accused’s extensive criminal record, his level of alcohol consumption, his present and past criminal histories and his total lack of remorse. 2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He had a lengthy record including 55 previous convictions; 17 of them for violence offences. He displayed no remorse for the actions he had done. He was sentenced to 11 years less credit for remand than was imposed for the manslaughter conviction.  3) Although the Crown provided the Court with three cases, the Court reviewed all of the cases and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Court concluded that a 15 year sentence was appropriate, primarily because of the numerous Gladue factors that the Court was able to identify. It was also appropriate to tie the hands of the Correctional Service Canada (CSC) in the handling of Gordon”s programming while in the prison, addressing his multiple complex needs, the vast majority of which are Gladue related, would be counter-productive and not in anyone’S best interest. The accused was given credit for three years, 7 months pursuant to S. 719 of the Code for the time he had spent on remand since being arrested in February 2016 to today” s. 1.5 to 1. That resulted in a net global sentence in the case of 6 years, 5 months and 1 year.  4) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 718.2 of the criminal code were examined. The principles were summarized in the sentencing guidelines prepared by the Crown. The sentencing guidelines were based on the best available case law and the principles of sentencing outlined by the Court in Hathway, 2006 SKCA (SentDig) at para 29, 359 Sask 34 and Harker, 2010 SKQB 138 (CanLII) in support of its request for a 15 years global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of that sentence pursuant to sec. 743.6(1).

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","HELD: The application was based primarily on the respondent's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. There was no dispute that just over 22 months had passed between the laying of the fraudulent charge and the scheduled trial date of February 28, 2000. The Crown acknowledged that the delay had not been caused by the delay in providing timely disclosure. However, the respondent argued that delay in obtaining complete disclosure had been sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. The respondent requested an adjournment of the preliminary hearing on the basis that there was a large volume of material that had not yet been disclosed to him. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8, 1999. The matter was rescheduled to June when sufficient disclosure was made. HELD: 1) The Court found that 8 months of delay was attributable to the Crown's failure to make timely disclosure and 2) to institutional resources. The prejudice to the accused was substantial and sufficient to tip the balance of favour in favor of requiring judicial stay of proceedings.  3) The Crown conceded its responsibility for the delay. It was not uncommon for Crown witnesses to move within two months of the scheduled preliminary hearing. 4) The length of delay is approximately 9 months. 5) The trial date was set in 1999. 6) The preliminary hearings were adjourned in May and June. 7) The 8 month delay was attributed to the delay by the Crown in relation to the Bingo charges. 8) The respondent was given short adjournment to review the RCMP file but the short recess was insufficient time for the Crown to be certain that everything from the file had been disclosed. The total delay occasioned by the failure to comply with its self-acknowledged legal obligation to provide disclosure amounts to 9.5 months.  7) In a normal course of business there would be no reason to delay a preliminary hearing by more than 8 months. The Court was satisfied that the Crown had not made sufficient disclosure in order to allow the accused to make an informed election. 8. The delay in resolving the outstanding charges has not resulted in any real prejudice."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania opposes the application. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. 2) While there is a risk of non-appearance for the respondent based on his failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and the fact that he has no real property and has identified no significant activities that connect him to the jurisdiction, the risk of his non- reappearance is higher in light of his current sentence in Romania than it would be in an application by an offender made directly under s. 679 of the Criminal Code. 3) The Court was not satisfied that the respondent's application to surrender himself to Romania was frivolous. 4) The relevance of the Citizenship and Immigration Act and the principles of freedom of expression and application to non-refoulement in this case was not at issue."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support. An interim order granted the wife exclusive possession of the farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farming yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the respondent was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. HELD: The application was dismissed and the Registrar was not prepared to vary or extend the order of May 27 and October 19 which prevented the husband from approaching the home quarter. The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband has been earning money which enables him to pay periodic support. He denied disposing of farm machinery and the 1994 crop had negative value."

The application is to be taxed against the applicant and the third party. 1)Pre-trial proceedings are procedural in nature. There may well be some delay by allowing third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. pre-trial was ordered by consent of the parties. It can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceeding, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third- party proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by the defendant in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiffs claim. 2)Each individual action brings by former student at the residential school is different in nature and may cover a different time period and/or employee so that the extent of the thirdparty's involvement will vary from case to case.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless, (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to order summary trial, or (c) the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. 3) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.  4) The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absent of a cross- examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing.  5) In this case the plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function. Taking these factors into consideration, the defendant bears a burden of showing there is no genuine need to trial."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was driving through a parking lot, the accused crossed the street and backed up to where the complainant was standing with their infant girl. The complainant was seated in the car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with the complainant's vehicle. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove careless. The officer's evidence that he did not raise any concerns with the accused was accepted. The collision occurred relatively short in duration and the Court was satisfied that the officer exercised due diligence."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. When the provisions of the policy are ambiguous, the judge may conclude that there is no duty to defend because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal. The chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to Guardian's argument that it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by Guardian was 'off target'. 2)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application to defend arises when he ultimately rules there is a no obligations to defend but submitted that Royal also has a duty to indemnify. 3)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) application could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1). However, this does not preclude a judge sitting at the outset from interpreting policy and determining whether the insurer would defend. In some circumstances such as this, the chambers judge may be required to embark on an extensive review. 4)The plaintiff has no duty at all to defend when a policy clearly does not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The complainant consented to the interception of the private communications and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police. The accused argued that the evidence of the conversation was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. The breach did not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2). The accused's application to exclude the evidence was dismissed. 1)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there was sufficient evidence before the judge to consider whether the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s24(2) of the charter. 2)There was no Charter breach. 3)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercepted private communications in relation to an offence not specified in the authorization was relevant. 4)The accused had sufficient evidence to bring the matter to the trial. 5)The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach, and the effect of exclusion on the administration of justice were all considerations. 6)The breach was non-conscriptive and should be considered to be non-consecutive evidence. 7)The failure to consider the seriousness of this breach, if there were other crimes revealed during the course of lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained in respect of an offence such as s.24(1) should not be excluded. 8)The application was dismissed in favour of the accused."

When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.
