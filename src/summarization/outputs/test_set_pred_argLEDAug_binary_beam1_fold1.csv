1991canlii2445.txt,"This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant was found guilty, in his capacity as regional manager, vice-president and director of an investment dealer, of four charges relating to information about a blind trust and permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades) in securities not approved by his head office and failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals. The appellant also raised a number of matters which he alleged gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant had not suffered prejudice as he had been a party to the proceedings and did not wish to offend the disciplinary process. The Board's findings were found to be within the range of acceptable conclusions."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.",The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the grandchildren of the deceased. The deceased had been involved in a motor vehicle accident which claimed damages to the extent that she subsequently died. The plaintiffs brought a claim for the expenses of discovery. The defendant brought an interlocutory notice requesting exclusion. The evidence before the court was clear that the defendants wished to exclude each of the plaintiffs from their respective discovery examinations. No application had been made to exclude the plaintiff.
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the Queen's Bench Judge on the ground that they had not been able to obtain the attendance of the witness from New Brunswick. The judge granted the adjournment. The applicant sought to have the adjournments refused on the grounds that he had not obtained the attendance requested by the defence on the basis that the witness was not available at the date of the trial. The defence had refused to supply the witness and the adjournement had been granted by the judge. The Queen's Judge had refused on a second ground that he was not able to attend the trial on the condition that he did not meet the witness's attendance deadline and he had also refused to co-operate with the Defence in setting dates and having the witness available at that time. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge, and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority."
1994canlii3880.txt,"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. He spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest under s.7.1 prior to being sentenced to 6 months' open custody, and 2:1 probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody and the amount paid by Saskatchewan Government Insurance for damage to vehicles was $21,062.71. 2)The youth court judge considered aggravating features such as the police chase, the deliberate damage done to vehicles, the defendant's co-operation with the police and the large number of charges before him. He considered that J. m.'s partner in these auto thefts was [T.D.] who received 8 months open Custody for some 19 auto thefts and attempts. 3)The accused had made a great change during the course of his imprisonment. He had made excellent progress in changing his ways. The Youth Court Judge counted the amount of damage done by vehicles, for example, by breaking window and then the ignition 'cheating' the ignition. 4)The 18 months open and custody of the accused will run consecutively so that his custodial disposition, in total, will be 10 months open."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.

The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the chambers judge in this instance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appeal is dismissed with costs on triple Column V (the court was not satisfied by the acceptance by the Chamber judge of the figure by HELD): The appeal has been dismissed with usual costs of double Column VI (the Court was not served with the appeal notice) 1) The respondent's income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings. The appellant seeks to have his respondent's Income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of my capital cost credit. 2) There is clearly no basis for adding the Value of un sold grain onhand to the income of the respondent. There is no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondents. This grain is therefore to be viewed as part part of their gross income in the year in which it is sold. 3) The appeal concludes that there is no reversible errors in the acceptance of the amount by the Chambers judge in the instance."
1998canlii13707.txt,"FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors. The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing until November at which time the respondent Authority would review a decision of the respondent authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission hearing would be completely unopposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. 3)There is nothing unconscionsable about allowing a Commission hearing to continue even if it should become known to the Crown. The Disclosure of any information would result in new facts which were notready known to It. The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. There was nothing unconspondent with regard to the Commission being asked to consider a form of disqualification of the appellant's application if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and unlawfully cultivating marijuana pursuant to ss. 6(1)(f) and 7(1). A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The accused was asked where he was going and what was in the back of the van. HELD: The accused's answer was 'I am here to ask you for your name, address and where you are staying.'  1) The officer was not conducting any service-related police function and the detention was not aimed at protecting or assisting the detainee. It was an adversarial and confrontational process intended to bring the force of the criminal justice process into operation against the appellant. The Court reviewed various authorities and found that the random stop of a motorist amounts to an arbitrary detention. The fact that the accused was not taking the most direct route to his home would result in an issue of continuity of the evidence. 2) The accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his pockets, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. The Crown stipulated it was not arguing that the Crown had consented to the search. 3) The Court found that once the accused had asked the constables if there were any problems with the vehicle, they could perform a search incidental to the arrest. Once the accused is detained, the police officer is entitled to inquire as to what is in the vehicle. The search is unreasonable as it was conducted without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. 4) Counsel argues the present case is on all fours with Mellenthin. The Supreme Court recognized that the Random Stop of Motor Vehicle amounts to a random stop and the Court recognized there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorcyclist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The police officer was entitled to ask the accused where he had been and to whom he had spoken. The issue here is whether the search presupposes detention and suggests that the search began with the questioning of the accused. The constable was entitled not to ask what the accused said in the previous tense. The same applies to the questioning in this case. The officer's reasonable and likely grounds to believe that the person he was questioning is not committing an offence against the law. The validity of the"
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and granted leave to appeal on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released. HELD: Application for release was dismissed. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. Turning to the public Interest, the issue of delay in this appeal was not raised. To do so would be inimical to the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the likelihood, as the applicant would be found to be in the minority in some capacity in the future, of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The motions were based on Queen's B Bench Rule 188 but also relied on Queen' Bench Rule 3(e) and Rule 173 of the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The motions could not be brought on a party's behalf. The cause of action was fully accrued and the plaintiff had a prima facie case. Even though the applications were grounded in a limitation period, there still was a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. The remaining substantive issues were determined. 1) Whether the plaintiff was subject to a statutory limitation period; 2) Whether his claim was barred by a statutory one; 3) Whether a portion of the claim disclosed a cause of actions. 4) Whether there was a breach of Charter rights. 5) The limitation period did not commence until after the expiration of the stay of proceedings. 6) The statements of defence filed by several parties were not limited to events prior to the entering of the trial. 7) The Court of Appeal dismissed the motion. 8) The appeal was allowed with costs under double Column V and the other below set aside."

The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue was the interim custody of the child. The parties began to cohabit in 1998 and in 1999 they would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to her every weekend. In 2000 they ceased to coexist and in 2001 they ended access. Since then the parties have had an arrangement whereby the respondent would see Keanna on every second weekend and every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access and the respondent ended access completely. The petitioner asserts that the every second Sunday access was interrupted by couple of violent episodes in 2002. Counsel for the petitioner argued in chambers that the Respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the petitioner. HELD: The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent. The respondent has provided suitable care and has met the petitioner's needs. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and the petitioner is assured of reasonable access. The court will make an interim order for custody of her. The child shall have reasonable access including every second Saturday, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods. The Court will have costs of her application."

HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992 and Regulations made thereunder. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies the husband had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the letter of August 6, 2002 was not the direction of the Superintendent, which may be enforced pursuant to s.16 of the Act and that its decision respecting his powers was open to him to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting the powers he claimed to have and purported to exercise was not strictly necessary to the decision. The matter was also addressed as preliminary issue only without any adjudication on the merits. The decision was left open for the Superintendent to argue another day in the stayed proceeding or in another case in proper factual context, which was lacking here."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and the child care expenses would be appropriate in these circumstances. The parents agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The father would pay child support of $647 per month for the period 2006-2007, with the exception of Remembrance Day, when the children would spend time with their mother. The parties agreed to share parenting time with the children every second weekend, with a variation of Sunday evening when the father would pick the children up after school. The mother sought to have the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in accordancewith his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost in accordance according to their respective incomes. HELD: The court ordered that the current parenting arrangements remain in effect with the exceptions of Rememance Day and Christmas access. The current arrangements would appear to be detrimental to the children as they were predictable in their day-to-day parenting and the father's suggestion that the children spend more time with his children during the Christmas, Easter and Boxing Day periods would not appear to go against the children's best interests. The alternating of holidays would not be contrary to the parents' interest and would appear beneficial to the parties. The Father's Day obligation was to pay $647.00 per month to the mother for the child's access to that day."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.",The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's shovel and the defendant followed him with his fist. The two men were on a residential property when the accused's shovel was struck. The defendant later confronted the accused about the alleged theft and the accused claimed that the knife had been in his hand. The accused and the shovel were both in the driveway when the defendant confronted the defendant and the confrontation escalated. The confrontation was described as a fight and the victim suffered fractures to his arm and leg. The defence evidence established that the accused had a knife in his left hand and the knife was in the defendant’s hand. Both parties were charged with aggravated assault. The Court found that the defendant had not believed the accused’ s.268 (and that the assault was justified) because the Crown had presented a clear and convincing challenge to the accused that the youth would not use the knife. The knife was not in the accuseds hand and neither was the accused. The offence was committed as a result of the confrontation. The court found that both parties were in the role of aggressors and that the confrontation was justified. The evidence established the accused was not prepared to heed the obvious meaning of the knife and was intent in prevailing over the accused to stay off his property and assert his right to enter thereon.
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The questions are answered as follows: 1) are the children of S.T. who is legally married to S.M. The Minister seeks an order under s. 11 of the Child andFamily Services Act declaring Katie, Hannah and Bobby to be children in need of protection pursuant to S 37(1)(a) of the Act. If, however, determine that the children are not children in Need of Protection pursuant to the Act, then a short term supervisory order under S. 37 will be made respecting each child pursuant to this Act.  2) S. T. who currently resides in Leask is not involved in this matter. S.t. has terminal cancer. STS is not attending this trial. SSS is not participating in this proceeding."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The court found that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the defendant and entitled to claim pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff’s obligation was to provide oats of certain quality to the serviceable company, Bio Canada. The issue was whether the plaintiff”s documentation was admitted into evidence. The documents submitted by Bio Canada were not admitted into support. The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the serviceible company. The quality requirements of the contract had been met and the payment of $61,608 to the plaintiff was made. The defendant had attempted to place the onus of the delivery of the oats in acceptable condition to the German miller upon the plaintiff even though the plaintiff is not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by BioCanada. The Court found that although the plaintiff had complied with his contractual obligation to provide the oats with a certain quality standard, there was nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed."

The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. The by-laws prohibited the erection of signs without a permit and stipulated that a sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. The Town argued that the by-law was completely reasonable and proportionate to the respondents' freedom of expression. The respondents objected to the bylaw because they argued that they were restricted to advertising in the core zone and against the Town’s right of freedom of speech. The town argued that by-lining signs and prohibiting them in the downtown core area were completely reasonable restrictions on the respondents’ freedom ofexpression. Application allowed; order issued for the respondents to remove the ground sign if not removed within 15 days. The limiting measures of the by law are rationally connected to the objective and effectively addresses unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The application is allowed and an order will issue pursuant to ss. 266(3) of the Ontario Municipal Government act directing the respondents, if not, to remove it within 15 minutes. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. The Court found that limits on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) ofthe Charter are demonstrably justified pursuant to the Charter. The limits imposed demonstrably justify pursuant to it. The limited measures of s. 266 are rational connected to and effectively address unrestricted useof available space to maximizes use of sign. The primary objectives of the By-laws are to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prohibit distraction to motorists. The objectives of these by-laws are similar to those of the municipal planning strategy and to prevent distraction to motor vehicles. The reduction in the number of signs permitted in the city limits is demonstrably rational and within the range justified by s.(b)of the Charter, especially since they are less intrusive and less intrusive than standard signs. In a city, the means used by the municipality to achieve its goal through the by -law are reasonable and proportional to the infringement of the appellant’ s.2(b)."

To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT.

HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. The mother's attendance at the trial was not totally supported by the evidence. Whether the mother would be required to produce her father's financial records is a matter for the Chamber to determine.

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses.

He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.

The applicant applied for a third ground of appeal, arguing that the decision of the commission was arbitrary and contrary to the principles of natural justice resulting in denial of the principles for fairness.

The application for a three-year license suspension was also dismissed; application for an order of the Commission restraining the appellant from engaging in any further misconduct was dismissed; and the applicant had not shown that the Commission had erred in law by failing to provide clear and convincing reasons for the decision.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parental arrangement. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of theseparation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he's no longer using the spouse. The corollaries relief judgment will result from this hearing.  1) The respondent has suffered a dramatic drop in income and is no now in his shared parenting plan. The Corollary Relief judgment will be imposed. 2) There is no suggestion that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered.  3) The parties' income for the last nine months has taken a dramatic and unanticipated drop. The parties are no longer seeking to have their income divided. The Court will take into account the circumstances at the moment the parties are experiencing a significant drop in their income. 4) The petitioner has been financing her education by managing her spousa support; other child related government income and student loan income. The Spousal Support obligation in that circumstance would be $750 per month. The Certificate of Disclosure filed by the petitioner was not filed with the Court. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. The Respondent sought to have that judgment incorporated into the corollory relief judgment. The petition argued that the Court's considerations are the same when called upon to set aside a separation, whether they are to be incorporated into a corollo relief judgment, and whether a significant decrease in his Income and a loss in income tax deduction for his payments under clause9 of the Separation agreement because the respondent is no more in a'shared parenting arrangement'. The petitioner argues that the corolla relief order will result in a corolla net relief order that would be appropriate for the purposes of the corolloary relief order. The court reviewed the circumstances in the petitioner's circumstances and found that the respondent had suffered a drastic drop in his annual income and that he is now no longerIn a shared custody arrangement"
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The plaintiff corporation (the defendant) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer (the plaintiff), principally in Rosetown, Saskatchewan. The plaintiff entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (the defendants) that supplied the defendant with financing. The defendants later entered into separate dealer agreements with the plaintiff. The issues arose between the defendants and the plaintiff as to the priority of the defendants' security over the defendants’ security as to credits to the new goods acquired by the plaintiff and the repayment of parts received by the defendant. The defendant companies argued that the priority extended to the defendants based on the interpretation of the priority agreements between the parties and to the interpretation that the word “specially ordered” as used in s. 50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act and the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse to restock direct ship inventory. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse restock the direct ship parts. However, ss. 50 (2) and (3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts'. The word ‘other’ must be added in the first sentence of paragraph 4.2 to correct a typographical omission. The court found that the defendants were acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. The parties had assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The priority extended only to the defendant companies based on their respective priority agreements and to include only assets that were not 'NHCC Financed Collateral'. The contractual provision clearly entitle them to refuse the restocking of direct ship components. The Court awarded the plaintiff $19,059.26. The other defendants were awarded $19.05 less $19.,059.27. The net sale proceeds were divided among the defendants."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and for contravening his Charter rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter. The accused applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under s. 8 and s. 10 of The Charter were violated. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of possession of narcotics. The evidence was excluded from the determination of admissibility of the evidence. 1) The accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home as he was observed driving and the smell of marijuana and alcohol was strong in the home. The home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The police officer who was conducting a traffic stop observed the accused weaving from the centre line over the fog line approximately six times. He located two packages of $20 bills that he believed were the contents of a suspected drug dealer's bag. He examined the VIN number on the dashboard of the motor home and noticed that it was different from the VINS number on his dash and the same number on a CDSA. The VIN plate and registration of the vehicle were all located in the same location. The presence of a large amount of cocaine in the motorhome caused the officer to question the accused about his previous conviction for auto theft. He asked the accused if he was on any medication and when he last used any liquor or narcotics. He indicated that he had used liquor the week previous and narcotics long ago. The officer then observed the motor vehicle being searched for drugs. He then located a large number of plastic bags containing bricks of cocaine. The officers then pried the panel off and found a stainless steel plate and under that black duffel bags containing marijuana. The number on that plate was different than the one on the CDSA number on both the CDIN and the VINE. The CDSA numbers were replaced by black plastic bags with marijuana residue. The CDs were found in the vehicle's trunk. The driver was concerned that he might have been drinking. The search of the car was conducted without warrant. The vehicle was searched within a few kilometres of the stop in both cases. The second search of vehicle followed approximately 35 minutes. The first search occurred within a half-hour after the second search. The third search took approximately 2-1/2 hours. The fourth search took about an hour. The"
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present.

He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","The Small Claims Court adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small Claims court had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for review of rental increase. He now heard an application for declaratory relief. The issue is whether or not the affidavit is properly before the Court. HELD: The Small Claims Appeal is a re-trial. It is not the same as an appeal to the Supreme Court which relies on the record from the court below.  1) An appeal from a Small Claims adjudicator on an appeal of an interlocutory ruling is still open to be brought to the Court although, pursuant to s. 32 of the Small claims Court Act, an inter-locutory decision is made. 2) An order or determination of an adjudicator sitting on an Appeal of a Director of Residential Tenancies does not serve to quash the individual's right to appeal. An appeal to that Court is not a final order or decision made by an adjudicating body. It's a rehearing of the facts. It does not mean that parties are prevented from engaging in further legal representation or that they are prevented, if ever, from launching an appeal if they feel aggrieved by the final decision that the adjudicator makes."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The Crown could not demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the background. The evidence before the Court was conclusive that the evidence was made from observations by the police officers as to the movements of the accused and the location of the transaction. The accused was able to articulate his position in the transaction, his clothing, his path of travel, his ultimate encounter with Mr. Burke, his presence in the store and the manner in which he was stashing the drugs were consistent with street level drug trafficking practices. The encounters between the accused's buyer and the seller were consistent and not consistent with any other possible explanations. The Certificate of Analysis of the Burke stone was also accepted. The two encounters were consistent for drug trafficking and not inconsistent with any alternative explanations."

They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, or in the alternative, of a litigation action, or an application for solicitor client costs, or alternatively in the alternate costs under Tariff 'C', as set out in Queen's Bench Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Old Rules.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property.

The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and a debilitating leg injury. He sought to have the Court review his obligation and whether it should be terminated. HELD: 1)The agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousals were either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the spousaling order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have his obligation reviewed by the Court, it does not follow that his obligation should be termination. There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It is significant that the agreement reached in 1995 does not provide for that spielal support was either timelimited or that is to be more varied if a substantial increase in the current financial position of the party was found. It's important that he knows now what he's actually doing. 3)The parties had three children. The respondent had recently retired from her university education and was unable to find employment. The husband had recently commenced some employment. He had not seen the benefit he would have received in the past from RRSPs, retirement savings plans and livers. He was concerned that his retirement income would run out before the year 2011 due to the difficulty in accessing his RRSP's.

3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for delegation to the Minister, for the duty of preparing and filing returns for tax purposes. The Act also provides for sub-delegation to the Revenue Commissioner. The Commissioner is the Director of the Revenue Enforcement Agency. The appellant seeks to have the Commissioner convicted of each offence under the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)Section 330 of the Code does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. 2)The Court was not faced with a challenge to the findings of the previous trial judge but was also faced with the issue of whether s.326 of the code should be read as to whether the Commissioner's return should be filed. 3)The letter of requirement was signed with the handwritten words of the Director using the name 'R.J. MacIssac' over the typed or printed designation of 'Director-Taxation'. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. 4)The appellant was not seeking to offend nor was he prejudiced. The appellants were merely trying to comply with the requirements of the legislation."

Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. The court also found that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement for Sale within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v). The appellant will seek the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court. The respondent shall pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs.This was also an appeal allowed per oral reasons. The parties were allowed to proceed in the appeal. The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. He found that ITI retained discretion under its contract with its students as to what course material it would supply and the fact that IT was obliged by its contract to provide, at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program did not rise to any contractual obligation as defined in s. 83.1. The Court also found the respondent erred by finding otherwise."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","The accused was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. The Crown filed an affidavit showing disclosure had been made. The respondent applied to the Queen's Bench for an order of prohibition. The Queen'sBench judge dismissed the application on the grounds she had not read the criminal record and was not privy to its contents. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to Provincial Court for trial. The court found that the Crown had not provided adequate disclosure to the defence and the accused that by virtue of the Crown affidavit it was being appended as exhibits to the affidavit. The appeal appealed and the respondent was correct to dismiss the application for a stay of proceedings and to decline to recuse herself."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. The mother's application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to Court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. HELD: 1) The father's application for further disclosure was made in September 2003 and an order allowing the mother to cross-examine the father on the affidavits and financial statements was granted in August. The child support application was continued until the father's termination. 2) The mother was to have costs ordered in the amount of $750 payable by the dad pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.  3) The applicant's income as at the time of this application was determined was $21,000. The $84 per month ordered for the child support purposes was based on the father having income of $40,000 and the $40k per year imputed to the mother. Based on the mother's gross annual income of approximately $39,000, the father was not underemployed. The court was of the view that the father could find employment that would allow him to meet his full-time obligations. 4) The court had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding."
4_1993canlii6771.txt,"Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The Court of Appeal dismissed the application for an order for costs. The Court found no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of the 2 year old son of the father to his father. The Father had not previously been regular access to the Child. HELD: The Appeal was dismissed. The award of maintenance was not unreasonable having regard for the length of the relationship (15 years), the husband'swage (approximately $55,000 per year) and the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home. The trial judge chose to accept the testimony of the Father's witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert witness who spoke as to the effect of abuse on children."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"FIRE, A Crown Corporation contracted to represent the plaintiff prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors and there was no suggestion that the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action, the contractual matters giving rise the basis for the action were ever consulted between the defendant and its former solicitors. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. 1)The applicant was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of solicitors (see 1982). 2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)The information itself cannot be disclosed, however, it is reasonable to insist that the nature of the information be disclosed. For example, had Mr. Willner participated in an action factually similar to the present one, such that he was privy to the corporation's strategy in dealing with the matter or its willingness to settle, then he might well be possessed of confidential information sufficient to disqualify him in this case. No such allegation has been made. Counsel for the applicant asserts that the situation in this particular case is exactly the same as decided because Mr.Willner, the subject of the previous application, and Ms.Schirr were partners or associates at all material times and if ruled in favour of the plaintiff then must do so now as all knowledge of one is for these purposes attributed to the other. 4)The application was being followed by a prior decision involving asimilar attempt to dislodge the applicants present solicitORS from certain ongoing litigation then relating to the 1982 Change of Government."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. The claim was dismissed when the plaintiff's lung collapsed, as a result of pneumothorax, a collapsed lung which he associated with the events of water skiing. Hurd required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. The respondent has four other children from two different mothers. The onus will be on him to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. The applicant has also applied for child support retroactive. HELD: 1) Section expenses are referred to as “add ons” to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. The Court must determine whether the parent is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. 2) The applicant’s current income is below the amount normally required for Table support and she has failed to establish her standard of living is less than that of the respondent. Section expenses in the amount of $1,000 to $2,000 are not eligible. The court reviewed the circumstances of each child and found that the respondent’ s. 9(1)(a) income should be set higher than the amount required by the Table amount and found no hardship. The application was allowed. 3) The court found that although the respondent had been unemployed for a few months and had not obtained employment, he had not shown that he was intentionally underemployed or had been unable to find employment. The facts were not in dispute."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search was conducted in the area of the accused's residence and was subject to numerous conditions, including that the accused not only display a marijuana license but also possess a vehicle and other recreational vehicles. The documents seized were found in the yard area of his residence. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search, the RCMP and RCMP agents noticed that there was a large amount of marijuana in the vehicle and that it was parked in the driveway. The RCMP and BC RCMP officers also noticed that the vehicle was a rented vehicle. The affidavit in question alleged that the RCMP had obtained a search warrant for the accused. The Crown argued that only if both warrants were found to be invalid, the search was a warrantless search. The evidence satisfied the court that there were no bad faith, malice or intentional omissions involved. The Court found that the Crown was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA and that the search authorized the search of the residence. Further, the Court found out that the affidavit in this case was not properly identified by the RCMP as it did not provide appropriate information about the accused and his offences. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. The Order of the Crown issued to exclude the evidence of the RCMP, BC RCMP and the Endorsing Justice from evidence at the accused trial pursuant to ss. 11 and 24 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court held that the application was dismissed. The application was not tainted by any error in law. The Bureau of Investigation conducted its own investigation of the offence and found that both the Code, CDSA, and the search warrants were invalid. The Enforcement Division conducted its investigation and concluded that the offences were per se unreasonable and in violation of the the accused s. Charter rights. The court found that there had been no breach of the oath and therefore the warrantless warrant was valid. The contents of the documents seized at the voir dire were excused by s. 583 of the code. The Certificate of Disclosure was not accepted. The Information obtained as a result of the Enforcement Division's investigation was not adequately identified by RCMP and Customs Enforcement. The CDSA endorsement justice violated s. 8 of the Saskatchewan Justice Charter by failing to obtain the required information."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 1 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act. The relevant portions of that Act are set out in L.S. v. E.P. (1969), L.L. (3d) 519 (Ont. C.A.) and Henry v. Walsh (2004), which examined the impact of the Guidelines on the granting of retroactive support. 2) The court is aware that some people (such as the respondent's wife) have remarried and they continue to live in close proximity to each other. This Court has a duty to provide support to the child such that he remains connected to his mother. 3) The respondent has always been close to his and continues to live close to each others. The Court is also aware that the respondent has a significant financial debt. The respondent's current income is less than the amount he was paying in 2004. 4) The parties have been paying child support since the divorce. The court reviewed the circumstances of each of the parties and found that the burden of child support placed on them was on them to pay it retroactively. The parties cannot be compared to debtors and creditors and their relationships are far more complex and personally intertwined. Retroactive support orders often create debt that may affect the payor's ability to meet his ongoing obligations to the children covered by the order but may also affect their ability to provide for other children in their care. The fact that these debts can be crippling does not excuse a failure to pay. 5) The respondents have always been willing and able to pay their costs. The burden of proof is not an issue here."

The appellant shall not enter into an undertaking to comply or supply the vehicle with a repair to the transmission. The consent decree was not amended to change the consent decree. The trial judge erred in allowing the Plaintiffs claim against a body corporate duly registered in the Province of Saskatchewan when it had agreed to honour its warranty by repairing the transmission provided the plaintiff bring the same to the defendant to have it repaired. An appeal is not trial de novo but an appeal on the record and the findings of fact by the trial judge must be given a high degree of appellate deference. Housen v.

AIG, 2006 SKQB 125 (QB) HELD : The appeal is dismissed. The findings of facts by the learned trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence. There is no palpable and overriding error.

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife was employed in the Navy and may be leaving the navy in the fall. The children were in the wife's care every second weekend. The husband was deployed in Afghanistan for six months. The parties had little face to face with each other. The Wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests for information regarding the children's educational program. The two children were placed in the husband’s sole care and custody. The father sought an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The estranged wife objected to the wife’ s decision to change jobs, object to the new direction her husband had taken in her direction, and questioned the wife on a number of occasions. She alleged that the husband was abusive to her and had sought financial assistance from the husband to move the children out of the wife home. HELD: The court found that the children did not benefit from joint custody as they had not had the opportunity to spend time with their mother. The court categorized the children as using violence against an intimate partner as its purpose was coercive control. The evidence showed that the wife was disrespectful of the husband personally and did not take the opportunity she had to explain her decision to him. The Court found that both parties were unable to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. The parents were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet these basic requirements. The nature and extent of the conflict between the parties was also a factor to be considered."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired (I.D.) and was charged for impaired driving. The accused applied for a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count and an order that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an agreement that the defence be allowed in the cross-examination of the Crown witness. HELD: The accused's application for nonsuit was dismissed. The Court found that the police officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and that the information contained in the Checksheet was never discovered by the defence. The Crown did not provide full disclosure to the accused until after the defence cross- examined the accused. The information contained within the Checksheets was never found by the Crown. The Chief of the RCMP testified at trial that he did not know the full content of the Operational Checksheet until after he had completed his cross- examination of the author of the document. The defence asserted a breach of the defence's right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of the Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Checkscheets and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown Prosecutor. The prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst. Pshyk's re-direct testimony and introduced the Checksqueets into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence and the defence had not disclosed that section.

HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The defendant sold business equipment to the plaintiff in September 2007. The plaintiff alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. HELD: The plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities. The Court finds that there is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. There is further evidence that the defendants did not know how to successfully install the equipment and that despite repeated efforts by their technicians and repeated calls to BMR, the equipment was never installed properly and is in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff at all material times. The Plaintiff has not proven any element on a probabilities of success."
4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga, and their subsidiary company, Potash Corporation. The defendants brought three separate causes of action. The first claim was wrongful dismissal. The second claim was defamation. The parties agreed that the pleadings of media outlets describing the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. The Court also found that the statements of media organizations describing the purported defamatories with sufficient clarity and clarity to warrant an order of this nature, did not prejudice the defendants and did not delay the trial. HELD: The Court granted the application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 7-9. It ordered that the paragraphs be struck as they are material to the plaintiffs' case and relevant to the issue of wrongful dismissal and any moral damages flowing from it. The pleadings were also ordered to be struck. 1)The pleadings in para. 67 and (c) were ordered to strike as they were material to various issues of the plaintiff's case. The court found that these particular pleadings did not assist in determining what the defendants did and did offer assistance as to why the plaintiff said it did. 2)The Court found that although the pleadments may be relevant to a determination of the notice of an action, they do not serve as a sufficient evidence to strike the action. They are mere pecuniary facts which are material and irrelevant to the plaintiff’s case. They were not relevant to determine the purpose of the action or to the real issues at stake. 3)The statements of newspapers were not sufficient to support the pleadements. The paragraphs were clearly material to establish that the defendant had directed the defendants to abandon their previous position of employment. The plaintiff was entitled to rely on the evidence of others that he had dismissed due to his personal circumstances. 4)The paragraphs were struck as immaterial and irrelevant. The only thing that would prejudice the parties was the irreparable damage that could be caused if the facts were found to be irrelevant."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.",The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused and his common law spouse had separated and had been living together for a few days prior to the offence. The complainant had called the accused late in the night preceding the offence and said that she was afraid to remain in her home.

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants for negligent driving. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also brought an accident action against her employer. The nurses advised against allowing the plaintiff to drive. At issue was whether the plaintiff should have been allowed to drive after having the abortion. Several of the nurses testified that they had been advised against doing so. The employer advised against permitting the plaintiff, who was a nurse, to drive home. The female plaintiff operated the vehicle in an Easterly direction and at all times operated it in a careful and prudent manner. She was also cautioned against driving while under general or local anesthetic. The evidence from the accident care nurse who testified at trial was whether she should have taken sedative or ibuprofen. HELD: 1)The court found that the evidence from both the nurse and the doctor was correct. The court found the following with respect to the issues:  1)It is a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient is well enough to leave on her own. 2)The plaintiff was permitted to drive, but the assessment would be held at a later date."

SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo). The plaintiff claims the Spreader was 'entirely unfit for spreading compost' and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. HELD: The action is dismissed. The plaintiff has not established to a balance of probabilities that the Spreaders was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in the Act and the defendants are awarded costs of the action. 1) The plaintiff was not required to take any steps necessary to make the purchase price known to the purchaser, or to have it provided to the purchant, within the specified period.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, a stolen motor vehicle, cocaine, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had stated in his written evidence that he had been arrested because he was the confirmed driver and sole occupant of a motor vehicle that had been reported stolen within the previous 48 hours. The strip search was conducted as a result of a complaint by a young person who reported that the police had found drugs in his vehicle. Although the accused had indicated that they were in the vehicle, the police testified that they had not seen the vehicle for the purpose of searching, and that they did not see the vehicle as being in the area where the drugs were found. The officer conducting the strip search testified that he did not look at the vehicle at all, nor did he see the driver's clothing change, nor was he aware that the vehicle was in the location where the drug was found. Although significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person, the Court found that the strip-search was specifically related to the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest and was not arbitrary or flagrant. The evidence heard on the voir dire was not relevant to the trial proper. The Court found the strip searching was conducted in a reasonable manner and that significant efforts had been made to preserve evidence and to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. The Act provides for enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected. The search was specifically focused on preserving evidence and for the purposes of preventing the loss of drugs, which itself was a legitimate and real concern on the part of police. The court found significant efforts made to protect the privacy of the youth and the personal integrityof the young Person. The decision to strip search, specifically related, to the search itself, was squarely related to that totality of the circumstances surrounding and was incident to arrest. The law is clear that significant effort was made to ensure the privacy, personal integrity and stability of the accused. The judicial administration of justice was at stake. The case law provides a framework for police in deciding how best to conduct strip search incidents in compliance with the Charter. The principles set out in Golden, supra, apply to the circumstances of this case. The force applied was minimal and was minimal."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused, who was charged with sexual assault and pre-sentence report, applied to set aside his guilty plea to count 1, the sexual assault of his son. The charge was based on allegations made against him by his father, who had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for sexual assault. The father had pled guilty to the charge in 2007 and had been extensively involved in the preparation of the pre- sentencing report. The son had not seen the video of the alleged assault and had not been advised of its alleged nature. The accused claimed that he had seen the v. v. of the Crown's expert witness who had testified at the pre sentencing hearing that he was not aware of the allegations made about him and that he wished to enter a guilty plea because he wanted to spare his son's testimony. Application dismissed; the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the accused's evidence regarding his lack of knowledge or understanding of the nature of the allegation was not credible."

The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.",The Court granted the application. It then sought the police reports and witness statements of the accused in respect of two alleged victims of aggravated assaults and in respect for particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. The Crown also sought updated criminal records for each of the two accused. The Court found that the third party records in the possession of the applicant outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material. The court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal files to counsel for the accused.Copies of the documents were made available to counsel and to the Crown in sealed envelopes. The documents were to be returned to the Court in the coming weeks. The order for disclosure was granted.
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and s.255(1(b)). The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and his breath was 100 milligram of alcohol. The accused was given a list of persons to consult with regarding legal advice and legal issues. The list was never produced. The police did not provide counsel to the accused. The officer did not return to the complainant's home until after the computer search was complete. The complainant did not have access to the lawyer and the police did no harm by failing to provide him with a copy of the lawyer's licence. The complainants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the onus is on the accused to show an unequivocal waiver of the standard for an effective waiver of s.10(b) of the Charter. The onus of proving an effective waiver of the right to counsel is on. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the Court was not prepared to set aside his decision."

The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault, sexual touching and invitation to sexual touching. The accused was found to have been performing oral sex on her 8-year-old son while he was taking photographs of her. The search was conducted on a laptop computer. The evidence obtained was that the accused had been viewing pictures of herself in a computer and mediaeval of her life while an adult took pictures of her in the nude. The police did not search the computer immediately because they were advised by the Crown that they did not need further warrant to do so. The court reviewed the ITO and its provisions and found that the information obtained was not relevant to the investigation of the offence alleged to have occurred and the warrant was not invalid. The Court concluded that the use of the computer by the police was a sufficient and reliable evidence to support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially and that the Court found that there was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The use of a computer by police was not sufficient to support a valid search and seizure pursuant to the warrant. The arrest and handling of the complaint was not the focus of the voir dire as it was not tangentially raised. The defence argued that the court could not, in the form presented, support the issues of the search by a Justice acting judiciously. The ITO did not permit further searches but rather failed to differentiate information and belief. The affidavit also failed to distinguish information and believed, which is not sufficient for a justice to support an issue of this sort. The voir de dire was therefore rendered null and void. The application of the Court to quash the voirus dire was dismissed. The portion of the affidavit dealing with the alleged denial of rights to counsel was also dismissed."

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When he got through to the intersection, another vehicle came into the path of the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff locked his doors and skidded to a halt, attempting to avoid the second vehicle. HELD: The defendant was convicted of failing To yield. 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that the intersection was safe to do so. The court found that his actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failing to yielded the defence of due diligence was established. 2)The court found no evidence that either driver was impaired. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. The pedestrian may also have had only parking lights on. It may well be that the defendant through the exercise of higher degree of vigilance may have seen the oncoming Tempo."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. The Public Trustees is a public trust and is not served with notices of application for property guardianship and does not intervene in such applications. The practice under the previous legislation was very much ad hoc. If the applicant was from out of the Province or was not a beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, bonds were usually required. The applicant was not seeking to be appointed without a bond and the fees charged by the public trustee are set out in Regulation to the Public Guardian and Trustee Act. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a Bond contained in s.55(1). Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent. 2) This was a routine Application by siblings who are usually the respondents and to include a bond in the order to issue an order is to largely eliminate the mandatory filing of bonds contained in ss.55 and 55(1) of the Act. 3) This case was not an appropriate one to dispenses with a Bond. The application to be appointed personal decision makers was in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order."

Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned.

Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence.

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.

6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. The court of appeal was granted and the conviction convictions were restored.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The appeal revolves around s. 2 of the LCRA. Where land is hereafter sold under an agreement for sale in writing, or mortgaged whether by legal or equitable mortgage for the purpose of securing the purchase price of the land affected, or where mortgage is hereafter given as collateral security for the purchase purchase price, the vendor's or the vendor’s portion of the debt is restricted to the landowner’ s. 25 debt. 2) The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings for placing the interest on the non-Purchase money portion of a debt are examined. 3) The LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the purchase money debt and nonpurchase funds on a pro rata basis to determine the amountof the deficiency judgement. 4) The determination of the amount is governed by the principles set out in HRYnewich. HryNewich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of the LRA and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. In addition, HryNEWICH Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out earlier in this judgment."

Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured, started an action against the defendant and the insurer of the plaintiff's vehicle, the defendant, for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff was employed as housekeeper but denied any involvement in the work of the business. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had paid her $360 per week for 40 hours weekly on the basis of misinformation and unprovable assertions. The defendant alleged that this was her job. The insurer refused to pay the plaintiff any more money. The court questioned the plaintiff’s employment evidence. The only record of the defendant’ s position as to employment was from a ledger page. The insurable earnings report made to the plaintiff showed that she had worked in the business for the plaintiff. The Court found that the plaintiff had not shown any interest in claiming repayment of the money paid under Schedule B and that she was not entitled to any benefit under Schedule C. The common law spouse’d employment was with her common law husband. The employer had acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the information provided by the parties to the employment claim and the plaintiff did not appear to be working for the employer."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of the police officer who at the time was an inmate. The accused's testimony was in relation to a visit by the officer at the hospital and not at his home. HELD: 1)The facts were in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand. The officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to take the blood and he signed the second certificate. The doctor testified that the officer told him that he had no idea who took the blood, but that he assumed the blood was taken by the doctor. The police officer did not ask the permission of the doctor to take any blood and the accused clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. 2)The Court was satisfied that the facts were facts. The facts were reasonable and probable grounds as determined by the parties involved. 3)The evidence was concluded that the accused would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life orhealth of his patient. 4)The court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence was reasonable and that the reasons for the demand were valid. The Court was also satisfied that there were no reasonable and likely grounds for the Crown to rely on the Certificate of Analysis."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The marriage was established as a result of the divorce. The custody of the two children was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. HELD: The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. The husband was to contribute his proportionate share of the orthodontic treatment expenses that was not covered by insurance. The amount of spousal maintenance payable was to vary according to the parties' income. 1)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and the petitioner was ordered not to have any children outside of the marriage. 2)The petitioner was to have her pension divided by $485 per month subject to matrimonial property adjustment calculations.  3)The parties had reached agreement on some of the issues and substantial agreement on others. The petitioner had been unable to find employment for several years. She had been economically disadvantaged and unable to support herself and the children particularly during the marriage as she had no employment outside the home for many years. The court was not prepared to allow such speculation."

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order in response to a variation application by the father that reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information, 10 months out of date. He had been in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order and was in default in the 2003 and 2003 years. He sought to rely on a medical disability of which he had given no previous notice. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material. The court was not at a disadvantage in allowing the application to proceed as it was, in the rarest of circumstances, when a party applying to reduce a child support and to cancel arrears absent full disclosure by the Father."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under S. 253)(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for police as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of driving while his Ability to Drive was impaired and that his blood-alcohol concentration was over the legal maximum at the time he approached the police officer. The accused's argument that he had only consumed six beer at the station and then had to listen to music while he was arrested raises a reasonable doubt that his Blood Alcohol Count was over 80 mg% at the moment he got out of his vehicle and approached the officer.  1) The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. 2) The Court was satisfied that the accused was drinking beer steadily over the hours before he drove and that he did so to evade the police. His blood alcohol content was over.08 at the conclusion of the pursuit. The Court rejected the accused's contention that he wasn't trying to evade this police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. 3) The evidence of the last drink was not a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption as he was concerned about losing his licence and having his vehicle seized. The drinking history of the officer was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the one given by the accused. The defence offered a credible explanation for the accused drinking more beer than was reasonable in order to avoid arrest. The only witness was alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott. She gave opinion evidence based on the drinking history the accused gave at trial. She found that the defence offered no credible explanation as to how the accused had come to the conclusion that he consumed six or more beer in the evening and then drove to the police station and refused to stop, saying his reason for doing so was to avoid seizure of his truck. The Certificate of Analysis was based on a different drinking pattern. The officer said he assumed that the drinking pattern of the individual he spoke to in the course of driving was different. He assumed that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway. The BAC readings were based on his own drinking pattern and the factors"

A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code.

The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded in a 1998 judgment.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The defendant/plaintiff sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contracts. The plaintiff counterclaimed for expenses it claimed due to the failure to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed against the amount it had been paid for equipment rental and other expenses it had incurred because of its failure to obtain the equipment on time. The contractual obligation to maintain the banks, ditches, railway and power plant (the 'Bank of the Ancients') was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contract between the parties' and the wording was not the same as in the original invitation for tender. The court found that the wording of the original invite for tender did not change and the defendant counterclaim for monies received under the tender and extras for services it claimed to perform because of it. The defendants' obligations under thecontract were not as extensive as they would have been if the wording had been used in the previous invitation for tenders. The fact that the equipment was not from the original source and used by the defendant but was used by another contractor for the blending and banking of coal at the 'Lingan Mine' and was used to blend coal at various stages of the 'Miner's Vacation' was irrelevant as it was not being used. The Court found that in the context of the actual work performed, the contractual obligation for maintaining and service the banks was to have been construed by both the wording and the invoice for the equipment supplied by the plaintiff and the Certificate of Payment issued by the defendants. The Certificate of Charge was to apply for the reimbursement of the monies it had received from the plaintiff for equipment rented and/or by the companies that had provided the equipment and services under the original tender. As the plaintiff was not seeking reimbursement for monying, equipment rental, and equipment rental costs, the court found the defendant's obligations to act under the 'Bank Of The Ancients' to be inconsequential. The contract was not subject to the parol evidence rule as it did not provide the specific information required by the parties to perform their contractual services. The specific purpose of the Bank of the Atom's Vacations was not to provide for the maintenance of the banks but to provide the equipment to assist the plaintiff in preparing its own maintenance schedule for the particular shift. The purpose of this provision was to provide a'short-term solution' to the problems with the equipment at the LBC by"

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house; breaking and breaking and leaving jewellery and other stolen goods; breaking into a dwelling property and committing the theft; being at large on his undertaking given to a justice or a judge and being bound to comply with a condition of keeping the peace and be of good behaviour failing without lawful excuse to complywith that condition contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code; breaking, entering and breaking again; all of these offences were committed within the meaning of the conditional sentence imposed. The Crown had sought a penitentiary sentence and the sentencing judge had responded by imposing a sentence of three to four years. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitential sentence. 2)The sentencing judge was of the view that a community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the offender. However, the conditional provision of sentence imposed for all the offences was ignored. 3)When the public has not had the opportunity to understand and appreciate the gravity of the offences before them, a sentence like this is appropriate when the offender has already spent time on remand. A sentence of this length should not have been imposed when the community already had the protection available to them."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced a class action in Saskatchewan in 2006. The defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay the action pending review by Queen's Bench Rule 173. The applicants sought the same discretionary order as the Court of Appeal in Englund on the basis that this action and similar proceedings had been commenced in other jurisdictions, but in different jurisdictions. The Court rejected the application and held that the action was not an abuse of the Court's process and that the Court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. The application was also dismissed with costs to the applicants."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for his daughter. The mother had recently moved into her mother's apartment taking the child with her. The Father had not seen the child for the past few months and was awaiting trial on a charge of assault against the mother. HELD: 1) The evidence was inconclusive as to whether the father had threatened the mother with removal of the child or whether he had simply stopped caring for her. 2) The father was not to be under the influence of any drug 12 hours before and while he was in his care. 3) The child was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. 4) The mother was to have regular access for two weeks at a time. The child would be at risk of harm if left in the care of the Father without supervised access.  5) The court reviewed the various types of supervised access available in the province and found that the most appropriate access was for two hours each weekday. 6) The Father was to take part in a parenting course.
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appealed a decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children.

The father argued that the judge erred by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by failingto apply a presumption of the status quo, by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant and by failing not to consider evidence asto the best interests of the parties. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis for the maximum contact principle alone to order shared parenting. The principles of maximum interaction and the principleof maximum contact were not properly considered when making her determination. The Chambers court judge did not err in giving weight to irrelevant considerations, controverted affidavit evidence, inadmissible evidence and short term matters but she was unable to draw any firm conclusions from either side on this issue.  2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence was reached. The judge was unable, in her best interests, to draw the firm conclusions either way. 3) The Court found that the Chambers Judge made no error in law in making her decision. The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. The chambers judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in status quo but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the Children's condition, means, needs and circumstances. This argument cannot succeed. 4) The father was awarded costs of the appeal."

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence led to the conclusion that the respondent did not intend to assault his wife but that his state of awareness was akin to that of automatism or insanity.

9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing and thereby interfering with the plaintiff's lawful use of the premises and with the employment of its employees. The defendants granted an order abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action. The notice of the motion was also refused on the ground that the picketers had not displayed any preliminary objections or applications. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the application. The acts complained of were illegal and had caused loss and damage to the plaintiff. HELD: The Court granted the order restraining all the defendants except for the one who had filed the materials. The Court held that the acts complained were illegal as they were not directed at the plaintiff but were directed against the defendants. The injunction was stayed pending the trial. The court found no clear and unequivocal precedent for the principles underlying the condemnations of the picketing.
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were not charged with any offence. The defendants had not proven they were violating the bylaw. 2) The defendant had not demonstrated that he was trying to circumvent the provisions in the Planning & Development Act or that he had any other recourse. The court found that the defendants had simply taken the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality and that they should not be prosecuted for trespass to the public reserve. 3) The plaintiff had not made any complaints to the provincial government or the municipality as it had not been a party to the creation of the boathouse. The plaintiff was not seeking to offend anyone. The defendant's claim that he could not find any other way to use the land aside from the use of a boathole was not supported by the evidence. The evidence did not support the defendant's allegation that he should have taken more money out of the development to build the boaterouse. 4) The court considered the plaintiff's claim for costs in relation to the enforcement of the by-laws on the boating and resort properties and considered whether the charges should be dismissed. The Crown did not prosecute the plaintiff for breach of the charges."

HELD: The Crown appealed. The appeal was allowed. The acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. 1)The trial judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial lawyer. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus the trial trial judge properly considered the issues of income before dealing with mens rea. The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary or Conviction appeal courts. 2)The Crown asked the Court to overturn findings of fact made by the judge by the appeal judge by arguing the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. In fact, neither the trial Judge nor the appeal judges were prepared to make such a finding. The appellant misinterpreted his decision. The trial judge proceeded on a worst case, that is all payments receive by the appellantants constituted Income and then they considered the Issue of criminalintent. Thus in our view the trial judges proceeded on that worst case situation, that are all payments receiving by the respondents constituted income. The Trial judge properly considers the issueof income before deal with menses rea (the accounting records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes).

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s. 29(2). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Section 28(2)(a) contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to deal with the secured debtor and does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to dealwith the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The Trial judge found in error. 2) The respondent clearly gave the secured party express authority to deal With the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditors does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 3) The Credit union appeals this judgment. 4) Section 29(1), as contemplated in s. 6 of the P.

The land was not a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act in August of 1992. The homestead provisions of s. 44 of the act had no application in this case. The application adjourned as the court was not comfortable setting an upset price for the sale at $61,000 considering the amount they have invested in the property, unless there is no other choice."
9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied for DNA samples from the male, female and child pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for 3 D.N.A. Warrants. Each alleges that the middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to s 155 of the Code and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA as a condition of granting the warrants do not provide an indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish the adult male is the natural father of the 19- year old female and the baby and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking. DNA Warrants in Support. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised of the procedure. There should be some indication as how theDNA analysis will determine whether the father or mother of the baby is the biological father and how that will affect the negative any idea that the biological parents are 'traangers' or'strangangers' genetic speaking. 1) There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this 19-Year-old female and that her DNA sample is not associated with that relationship. 2) There are no similar registries in existence respecting his 19/year-old mother notwithstanding that she was born in Saskatchewan and the document should be as readily available as was that of the Baby. 3) The proper inference to be drawn from the words of s. 490.05(1)(b) is that a DNA sample may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, blood or like product produced by or carried by the victim at the time of the offence is found at or obtained in conjunction with a crime scene or on anything worn or carried in the victim's body at the moment the child was allegedly conceived. There is no bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incestuous relationships. 4) The natural mother has had no timely association whatever with the alleged offence. Given the naturalmother's allegation as to the birth father of both the 19 and the child and the latter's denial of her paternity, the information, if any, contained in the Registration of Live Birth concerning the birthfather would be of assistance in providing a complete picture for the court.  5) The conclusions have arrived at after analyzing each subparagraph individually are reinforced when s.485"

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to trafficking contraryto s. 267(a) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The evidence obtained after the initial stop was excluded pursuant to s24(2). The Court found that the accused's rights pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all evidence obtained post-stop should be excluded pursuantto s24.(2). There were more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the accused to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the vehicle. The accused's words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. The Court rejected the defence argument that the officer, upon smelling the marijuana, then had reasonable and probable grounds to conduct a warrantless search. The court found that during the course of highway traffic stop the police are authorized to make certain inquiries and need not turn blind eye to matters which legitimately raise their suspicions. The police in performing that duty need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and reasonable grounds. Specifically they are not required to establish a prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest. The S. Charter argument fails."

The court was not able to contact the applicant prior to the hearing date. The applicant's affidavit was also struck as not being served with the Applicant's application and supporting material.

9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","The defendant applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders made by the defendant regarding certain employees of the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff corporation sought to have the orders quashed on the grounds they were related to a Charter issue and related to the employment of union members. The defendant corporation objected to the subpoena and sought the production of documents referred to in the subpoena duces tecum. The parties submitted that the subpoena was unnecessary and unnecessary. The court referred to the portions of the subpoena that represented expert opinion on the meaning of the Trade Union Act s.2(b) and the meaningof the Charter. The defendants objected to a summary of the defendant's application and submission in a written decision. The summary of all the affidavits and the subsequent production orders was rife with opinion and argument. It was not possible, without a review of the transcript, to consider the allegation that the Board abused its subpoena power by permitting the plaintiff to discover and produce documents in contravention of previous rulings that it had used it to order the discovery and production of such documents. The companies' application for a declaration that the plaintiff corporations could not have third party representation in the workplace was also opposed by the plaintiff corporate counsel. The decision was appealed. Allowing the application and ordering the defendant to comply with the subpoenas and the discovery of documents, that a review is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application, and that it must be considered part of the record. The Supreme Court of Canada ordered that the companies comply with these requests and that the court make a written order respecting the discovery or production of the documents in the plaintiff's possession or knowledge of the representative witness within the corporate counsel's jurisdiction. The order also required the plaintiff Corporation to provide written reasons for its decision respecting the use of a subpoena duce tecum and its right to refuse a subpoena if it is otherwise prejudiced by s. 2(d) of the Charter or otherwise infringe its freedoms. The corporate counsel for the plaintiff also objected to certain portions of a previous order by the applicant corporation that related to union members and alleged that the board had abused its power to order production of materials in contravening s.9 of the trade union act. The issues were argued at the Court's hearing and before it, at the Board's hearing. The Court held that the issues were unrelated to the corporate culture of the corporation and focused on communications among management.

9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended. The adjudicator found the appellant's evidence to be more credible than the Crown's and three other witnesses testified to it. The appellant also argued that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, thereby failing to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the appellant and failing to offer the evidence of three other witness, a police officer and a mixed breed dog, who testified that they had seen the appellant get out of the driver's side of the vehicle and rush into the service station. The Crown alleged that the appellant was not the driver of the car because the officer had asked the appellant to move his vehicle away from the pump and refused, saying that he had no license and that he did not have to. The officer testified that he was not in the vehicle, but that he saw the appellant out of it. He said he flipped out and flipped out. The appeal was allowed. The conviction appeal was granted. The Court of Appeal must show great deference to findings of credibility made at trial. In R. v. Ryan, it was held that the trial judge's findings of reliability were not properly addressed. The Appeal Court must also consider whether the Crown was engaged in a critical analysis of the evidence in this case, namely, whether the adjudicating judge engaged in such critical analysis, namely in the analysis of whether the appellant fell victim to the 'either or' test."

The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus.

The defendant claims that the agreement was never reached. The court has no way of accurately determining whether the figure should be $800 or $900 because the plaintiff did not have a copy of the final invoice given to him and he did not bring a copy to Court.

Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert. The owner alleged the quasi-judicial board and the city had refused to grant him an adjournment to prepare his appeal on the basis that the order was biased against him. He sought to have the order set aside on the grounds that the board had not properly received the report on which the Council decision was based and had not acted in a reasonable manner to remedy the underlying problems. He also alleged that the police allowed criminal activity to escalate in the building. The board confirmed the demolition order and suspended the enforcement for 6 months to allow the applicant to remedy his problem. The applicant did not raise any concerns of bias. There was no denial of natural justice with respect to the use and activities of the building as defined by the Nuisance Abatement Bylaw. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The order was set aside. The Board was given the opportunity to bring forward a written proposal to the applicant that would address the issues raised in the demolition. It would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement for six months to enable the applicant, who was not on city council at the time, to bring forth his written proposal. The application was adjourned for an additional six months. The respondent was granted the opportunity, after the appeal had been concluded, to reconsider his decision. The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The Court found that the Board had not shown sufficient restraint in its decision to refuse to grant the applicant an adjourn to remedy these underlying problems and that it had failed to act in a reasonably reasonable manner by failing to provide sufficient notice to the board. The court found that it would be inappropriate to restrict either party in the way it would have decided the application should have been made. The appellant was granted an opportunity to apply for a subpoena or other Order directing the applicant's access to the relevant police files."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The applicant sought to strike the order on the basis that it was an interlocutory appeal from a decision which is part of an application under SCAN. The Chambers judge dismissed the application, but the applicant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules of court and the Court has the right to stay the order in the circumstances of this case. The Director's grounds of appeal are framed in the manner of a procedural order under Queen's B Bench Rule 173 and/or the inherent authority of the court to hear the appeal based on the principles of estoppel and collateral attack. The jurisdiction to decide the appeal of this appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss. 24(e), 25(1)(a) and (2)(b) of The Court of Appeals Act, 2000 and on the same issues as the one dealt with in Danyluk v. Morguard (2000). HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court will not deal with the issue of abuse of processes in this case because of the multiplicity and the application by the Director. The application is in the nature of a Procedural Order under Queen’s Bench Rule173 and/ or the inherent scope of the Supreme Court of Canada to set out the criteria for review and the same procedure as in the case of the Chambers judge’ s. 3(d) and s. 7(e).

The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused, who was related to the complainant, was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent. It was open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raised a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. The evidence of the accused's actions after the incident may be consistent with an absence of consent, they are equally consistent with regret, humiliation and embarrassment caused by the activity being broadcast. The court was satisfied that the evidence supported a reasonable and mistaken belief that consent."

After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Motor Vehicle Act when she knocked on the door of her residence without a permit and while she was in her own home. The accused did not ask the police officer in and as I have said the police officers' accompanying her around the home and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count one. The Court of Appeal affirmed in its summary judgment judgment that the Crown must prove the essential elements of this charge beyond reasonable doubt and that the evidence will be excluded. The evidence will not be excluded from the trial. The Accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The Act is amended to provide for the equitable equitable distribution of the evidence. The Police Department must prove essential elements and this charge is serious. The Crown must establish the essential element of this offence beyond reasonable doubts. The court must also demonstrate that the accused was watching the person to get evidence. This is a critical piece of information in an impaired driving investigation. The police officer was acting in the course of conducting a search when she did not have a permit to do so. The officer's conduct was not unreasonable. However, the Court of Appeals affirmed that the police department has a strong moral and ethical standing. The conviction is upheld on count two."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The court has authority to order an interim spouseal support pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997. 1) The parties were involved in a spousa relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband had a minor child in his care. They separated in July 2015. The wife currently supports herself from two sources of disability for total income in the range of $20,000 for a total income of $74,174. He has one minor child, who has been in his custody and continues to pay $1,100 in child support each month to his former spouse. He also has one adult child in the care. 2) The wife seeks an order in the sum of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. She also suggests that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply. This is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount requested.

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel which reinstated the respondent as an employee as held in December 1994. The panel had found that the respondent's termination was a culminating incident and that the penalty of discharge was excessive, especially when coupled with the respondent grievor's years of seniority and previous disciplinary record. The respondent was reinstated to his employment position immediately. The period from August 1993 to the date that this Award was being treated as a suspension without pay was considered a suspension. The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident, which concluded that the employer was not prepared to accept the respondent being reinstated. The Board rules that the applicant be reinstated immediately. However, the respondent shall receive no compensation. The penalty imposed was a suspension of without pay for 16 months. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The patently unreasonable test is absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of verbal evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the terms of the written document. With respect to oral evidence, the wording of clause 10 of the mutual agreement is very straightforward and would not admit of such an argument. 3)The Paragraphs Rule precludes receipt of oral evidence offered by the applicant for the purposes of adding a range of discipline and qualifying in the word 'dismissal'. The only basis for the receipt evidence with respect to the terms is in the event there is an allegation of intrinsic or extrinsic ambiguity in its terms. 4)The applicant took the position that labour arbitrators are entitled to deference in applying common law principles of interpretation to the provisions of the collective agreement but not to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating event. The sentence imposed was therefore a suspension Without pay for approximately 16 months without pay."

The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered injuries caused by the defendant. HELD: The Court answered the question: Did the motor car accident cause or contribute to any of the plaintiffs injuries or damage?  1)The evidence was conclusive that the defendant had not suffered a serious injury to the plaintiff as a consequence of the collision. 2)The court was unable to accept the defendant expert's opinion as to the cause of the damage. 3)The medical evidence was limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports. 4)The sole expert was not qualified to give an opinion as causation of injury as the cause was not known."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. This is because the debt at the time fixed for payment is conditional upon the vendors being able to make title, and where he has no title the purchase-money never becomes payable. This argument mixes two different streams of the law of garnishment: the law pertaining to 'conditional debts' and the law dealing with the garnishable of notes. In the former, the debt becomes an unconditional liability at the date fixed for payments. Under an agreement of sale, the debts at the point fixed for sale are conditional upon vendors being available to make titles and where, he has had no title, the purchase money never becomes available."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated using average renewals. The contract provided for a two year period in which the compensation was to be paid on the basis of new policies, with the exception of those paid in the winter months, and provided for relocation counselling. Allstate did not seek to justify the termination on the grounds of cause. The sales agent's course of conduct was not unreasonable and did not constitute a failure by him to mitigate his damages."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties and a further order preservingand detaining them. The defendants had filed an application under s. 91(2) of the Builders' Lien Act and s. 48(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules respecting the proceeds of various actions. The applicants sought anorder preserving and releasing certain proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a separate order preserving & detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The respondents filed an affidavit in support of the application. The affidavit indicated that they would be agreeable to lessors' royalties, Crown production taxes and normal operating expenses being deducted but would not agree to gross royalties or environmental reserve costs being deducted. HELD: The applicants failed the first and second tests.  1)The Court had already dealt with the considerably greater inconvenience to the respondents than would be the inconvenience to themselves should the desired order be granted. 2)The applicants failed to meet the third test. The Court held that the applicants' assertion of irreparable harm would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 3)The court was not suggesting that the respondents would lose their lien security as a consequence of the confusion between the applicants and the builders' liens. 4)The application was allowed."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's negligent conduct which caused damage to his vehicle. SGI refused to reimburse the plaintiff for the repair and claimed depreciation. The insurer brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation and a'reinstatement clause' which allowed SGI to recover the damage by sending an appraiser to determine the damage to the vehicle's exhaust system. SGE refused to pay the $1,000 repair fee and instead paid $503 to Crestview. The claim was referred to as an express election. HELD: The claim for reimbursement was dismissed. 1)The statutory scheme is clear. An election to repair is not an election. 2)SGI elected not to reinstate. 3)The parties in this action clearly intended to have the plaintiff's vehicle repaired. 4)The claim was not brought within the statutory limit as it was not an express one. 5)The court would be reluctant to hold that an insurer has exercised an election by conduct unless it was satisfied it had all the information necessary to choose the most advantageous course of action. 6)The Court would be open to the continued continuance of the litigation between SGI and the plaintiff. 7)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the $502.73 deduction for depreciation. 8)The defendant was awarded costs of the repair. 9)The plaintiffs claim that SGI elected to reinstall. 10)The insurer is not responsible for the loss of the vehicle. 11)The test of credibility is based on fact.

The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. The issues raised in the statements of defence were not susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and neither the defence nor the counter-claimed for damages. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The defendants had registered a mortgage against a condominium unit number 14 which was of significant importance to the plaintiffs' claim. 2)The plaintiff registered a condoleum against the defendants pursuant to the Condominium Property Act, R.S.P. and asserted that the sufficiency of the pleadings did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. 3)The issues raised did not appear susceptible of resolution on a summarily resolved basis and certainly not on a a summary or on a basis of the statement of defences. 4)The application was therefore dismissed with Costs to the defendant in any case of thecause."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff, who was the mother of the plaintiff's child, was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital as a result of a sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The doctors who had attended to the plaintiff had initially treated the plaintiff with a pelvic ultrasound, then underwent a hysterectomy. The plaintiff alleges that the hystroctomy was the most likely cause of the bleeding and that the resulting bleeding was caused by retained products of conception. The female surgeon who had initially attended to treated the girl was found to be suffering from a severe and persistent pelvic pain. She was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit where she was treated for three weeks. The hystrectomy and hystremesis were not performed as planned. The plaintiffs claim that the surgical care provided to the girl by the defendant was the only method which could have been performed. The Court takes issue with the conclusions reached by the medical experts, both as a general consensus and as a matter of fact, of the medical evidence. HELD: The Court finds that the medical opinions and the medical files of the Victoria union hospital were biased and in no way support the plaintiff’s position that the hemorrhage was caused exclusively by retained product of conception, even though their opinions and evaluations were strongly supported by the evidence. The court also finds that there was no evidence that the operating room nurses’ notes were fabrications of something that did not happen. The report of operation was realistic and reasonable. The surgical care of the plaintiffs was not based on a prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. The errors of judgment were determined by the Court based on the evidence and the evidence of the other experts."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and two acts of sexual assault contrary to ss.155 and s.155. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was a young person. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred prior to the date of the commission of the offence. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. The matter was remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The accused could apply to a youth judge for an order under s.16 of the Act to determine whether the alleged offences occurred while he was an adult or young person and could then apply to the youth court for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum. The principles applicable to a transfer proceeding under s.(16) of the act were set out.

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children.

The respondent sought an order for the payment of child support by reducing the monthly maintenance payable by reducing it from $250 to $250 and cancelling the arrears of $13,273 and Variation of the access provisions with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. The petitioner sought to vary the 1993 order by cancelling $13 million in maintenance payments accrued under the 1993 Order and by varying the access provision of the 1993 orders by varying them to the amount specified under the Guidelines. HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the 1993 original order. 2)The arrear from the 1993 cancellation was $13.273 and the balance of the arrenars accrued prior to that date was extinguished. 3)The petitioner was not prepared to apply for a further variation of the order. The issues were whether the respondent should have access on a full weekend to the Children or if he should have one half weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday for two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4)Access was not a problem in the past. The court ordered that the respondent be given access on not less than one full weekend per year between 6/30/day to 6/5/day on Friday and 2 weeks prior to Sunday. 5)The court also ordered that upon the payment $5000 on account of the $13 arreARS accrued under that order, the balance thereof shall be extinguished. 6)The mother was not able to apply because she was not made available for the application. 7)The father was not given adequate time to apply. 8)The wife was not allowed to apply either."

It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic.

When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. The doctors had been consultants to the hospital and each had a privileges to practise in the hospital. HELD: The action against the doctors was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence that the hospital entered into the arrangement with the intention that it was legally enforceable. 2)The common characteristics defining a fiduitary relationship were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood and the Supreme Court of Canada at 203. 3)The relationship between the doctors and the hospital was not defined by the standards as a relationship between a doctor and a hospital. The common characteristics of a fiduary relationship are discussed by Crouse and Kirsch in Baskingerville v.(SK CA), [1992] W.W.R. 193 and 'Mominos' at 210. 3. The relationship between all the physicians having privileges to practice in the community would perform on a rotation basis the on call duties required of each of the defendants. 4)The hospital was neither the originator of the on demand arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it. The arrangement was voluntary. 5)Each doctor was entitled to participate in the on/call services provided by the hospital or in some capacity as a party to the arrangement. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs to the plaintiff."

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,FIAT: The applicant applied for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings. The only other claimant who had been asked to regard the action as a test case were the hundreds of other claimants who had already been asked by management pre-trial judge to regard their claim as a matter of the best interest of their claims. HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial. The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by the counsel for the Canada government if the issues are severed are groundless. The plaintiff was stalling in the pursuit of resolution of the issues. He had been subjected to considerable time and effort by the parties to the cross and third parties proceedings.
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner was attending university and the respondent ceased paying child Support for the months of July and August 1999. The respondent ceased providing support for the children in the months when he was working full-time and living at home. HELD: 1)The respondent was not paying child child support when the order was made. The child was attending college and all her needs were met. The table amount of support for child support calculated based on the respondent's income would be $1,153 per month covering both children. 2)The petitioner was paying table amount support for both children based upon his income of approximately $80k per year. The parties' demonstrated ability to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment did not result in resorting to the provisions of s.3(2)(b) of the Guidelines. The amount of child support payable by the respondent in accordance with the Table amount of the support for each child was $1.153 per monthly. It was not appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of the petitioner during the months that he was attending school and all his needs were satisfied. 3)The children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of Nord’S negligence. He shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the date that judgment is payable and his costs to be taxed. The claim against Nordstrom was dismissed. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant and had a business relationship with Mayer, he was intimately familiar with the transaction and would have been aware of the fact that the realization of Mayer’d intent to benefit him was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. Nordstrom’’ failure to take these steps and his inexplicable compliance with the request to designate beneficiary regardless of its efficacy did not reflect the standard of conduct and care one is reasonably entitled to expect of a professional."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident. He was treated at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital by a doctor with an extensive medical knowledge and skills. During the course of the action, the plaintiff suffered a serious neck injury and was unable to move his legs. He came under the care of the doctor who had recently been appointed as a doctor to treat the plaintiff. The medical evidence presented by the doctor and his expert on the plaintiff was of such complexity that it should be assessed by a judge and not jury."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In 1997, the defendant entered into an agreement with the Town to open up the land beside the golf Course for residential development. The defendants later purchased the property from the plaintiff and began operating the course. Over the years, the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course onto their property have entered their property and caused extensive damage to their homes, their vehicles and the property's aesthetics. The plaintiff and their neighbours have suffered extensive damage from golf balls flying into their yards. Their property is now threatened by trespass. The defendant and plaintiff are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years. HELD: The Court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute continuing nuisance. The Court ordered injunctions to prevent the defendants from operating the ninth Hole until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations in the expert's report. The court was not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing on the apartment porch when the police arrived, yelling obscenities and swear at him. The complainant advised that the accused was outside of the apartment banging on the door. The two officers approached the accused and spoke to him. At the time of the arrest the accused's mother lived nearby. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful. The Crown had proved beyonda reasonable doubt beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt the officers' reasonable doubt they were engaged engaged in lawful executionof their duty (Operation Torch) when the person resisted their attempts to arrest them. The Court found that the arrest was lawful. Under s. 52(2) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, the peace officer may arrest any person whom he finds committing an offence under the Act. Under the SummaryOffences Procedure act, the police may arrest anyone whom he find committing an offences under the act."

The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VEH)'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction declared void because the charge was not a nullity. The appeal could not be amended so as to breathe life into something that was nullity, such as an 'offence not known to law' such as the one set out in S.6 of the Traffic Safety Act. 1)The Court found that the charge, so palpley bad, does not give a fair and proper basis to disturb the conviction entered or the fine imposed. 2)The count is a null nullity and is void ab initio. The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges and found that, even if the charge is a correct one, it is not possible to amend the count so as cure the defect.  3)The appeal was permitted and the charge declared void.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of the aggravated assault on the complainant. The Court determined that the accused had a defence of self-defence as he was not acting in the lawful execution of his duty and did not have a duty to intervene to prevent the breach of the peace. The offence was determined to be a violation of the complainant's s. 3(a) defence. The court found that the defence was not available to the accused on the count of aggravated assault as it was not proven that he had actually heard the s. 2(a)(b) defence but that his evidence was sufficiently supported by the facts to warrant a guilty plea.
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.",HELD: The application was granted. The court held that it would disregard the content of the applicant’s affidavit as it was not intended to be a declaration of deference. It ordered that the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation be interpreted to mean that the commercial owners would only be permitted to vote for their own nominees and to exercise their right to see them elected but were not entitled to vote on the election of the remaining four positions on the Board. It also ordered that a declaration be made interpreting the bylaw and that certain provisions of the by-laws be struck out so that the respondents could vote as a class as required by the by laws. The respondent was granted a stay pending the application.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application under s. of the contributory negligence act would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence.

The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs.

The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. The Court must also consider the fact that the respondent has no assets in the amount of $5,000 (unreduced for tax); there are vehicles, bank accounts and RRSPs to be divided; the wife would be responsible for her Mastercard debt; and there are other items in dispute in the family property division.

The accused was acquitted of both counts. The Court found that the accused had not believed the complainant's testimony and that she did not wish to be seen by the public. The complainant’s testimony was not believed by the court and, in light of all the evidence, it was concluded that they had reasonable doubt. The court attributed the credibility of the complainant to K.S. as to what she said in her journal during the trial and attributed her behaviour to being confused by her sister. The defence had attempted to use the same principles in R. v. W.D. in its case. HELD: The Court concluded that the evidence of K.T. was insufficient to support a conviction. The evidence of the accused as to his character was insufficient. The trial judge should have given the jury appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility. The test is to be applied where there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed the offences. The Crown was not able to prove the accused’ s. 1 and 2 convictions.

The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals this acquittal. The respondent was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. For the reasons that follow, the Court would dismiss the appeal. In their view, the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a) of The Criminal Code; the Crown argues that the trial judge erred by applying the incorrect mens rea and actus reus to the offence of dangerous drinking. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The Court of Appeal has a duty to look at the facts and to make its findings as fact. The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of dangerous drive. The jurisprudence currently recognizes four situations in which an error of law can be made. The first is an error in law. The second is an honest mistake. The judge correctly applied the mens rus and actuus. The third is an incorrect interpretation of s.249(1(a). The trial court correctly applied s.253(1) of that Code. In this case, the trial court erred in finding that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because only elements of the offence need to be proven beyond areasonable doubt. The court was not satisfied that the Crown had not corrected the factual issue of the appellant's speed with either the actus or the menses reus."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was brought 4 months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s.35.1. The Director's application was not statute barred and there was no limitations issue. The Court found that s.34.1 is the correct wording to describe the legislation. The legislation is civil not criminal and it is an in rem remedy. The Act does not make expressly retroactive the legislation nor does it provide that the Director has to be charged with a criminal offence for the Director to pursue civil remedies under this statute. The facts are clear and unambiguous. The evidence is not relevant to the search of the defendant's residence. The defendant's application is not statute-barred and there is no limitations issues."

The applicant argued that there were significant areas where the interests of the bank conflicted with interests of the creditors. The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.",This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be creditor of the bankruptcy. The Bank opposed the Trustees application. The applicant sought independent legal advice on the matter. The Respondent Bank declined to object. The Application was Dismissing. The Court found that the conflict of interest between the counsel for each party was so blatant that it demanded the removal of them. The respondents should not be advised by counsel for both the Trust and the Bank.

The existing zoning for the property made the height limit 45 feet from where it was set out in the zoning map ZM-17.

c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers or their maintenance. He suffered a small injury when the nozzle of the paint sprayers plugged and the paint and solvent dribbled out. He was rushed to hospital where surgical procedures were performed to clean and stop the progress of the foreign substance. He sued the defendant for loss of income, past and future. The plaintiff argued that the defendant was duty bound to provide warning to renters of the high pressure in the sprayering. The defendant argued that warning was unnecessary because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for a further six years more expeditiously. The plaintiffs claim loss of earning capacity, past or future. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was awarded for loss in the amount of $10,000. The non-pecuniary damage issue was assessed as being $5,000 rather than $10000. 1)The non-cognisable damage issue existed because the defendant failed to take steps to properly inform the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paint sprayering product. 2)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $18,789.50 plus costs and pre-judgment interest on $10k from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1990. 3)The court found that the plaintiff was negligent in failing to inform the defendant of the risk involved. The waiver was ineffective. 4)The defendant was to assume the share of the loss resulting from the amputation of the finger and the liability for the loss of future income, rent and loss of time. The claim was also considered in relation to the non-pursuant income index for 1989-90. 5)The claim was not subject to inflation because there was no excuse for dragging the matter out for 6 years without a trial or proper maintenance. 6)The plaintiffs claim that the non pungent paint sprayery was dangerous because the dangers associated with placing a finger in front of the nozzle would be well known to ordinary, prudent person. 7)The Non-pecunal Damage issue was not established because the nonpursuit income index was not reasonable. 8)The award of $5k was awarded to the plaintiff for the $10K loss from January 1991 to December 1990."

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married for 35 years and had two children, Chad and Ryan. The respondent was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be employed. The parties were engaged throughout the years and each contributed the income earned to support their family. Chad and the child born in 1976 had a pediatricianate and had a grade school education. One of the parties' primary assets was their police pension plan. The other child was dependant and the parties were often required to make additional contributions. Through the circumstances of the debts and the bankruptcy, the parties had been spending heavily on their police training and the couple had a car available to them. The wife now sought to have the value of her pension transferred to a locked-in RRSP. HELD: 1)The wife was to pay child support of $260 per month for the next 3 years.  2)The parties' pension plan was divided according to the best available valuation. The best valuation would be $150,000. 3)The husband was to either pay lump sum amounts or the commuted value of his pension in the wife's name or an 'if and when' order."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","The chambers judge dismissed the appeal.

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.

The farm expenses were determined as follows: 1.The cost of operating the machinery and the capital cost allowances were adjusted to reflect the 1997 farm income; 2)Whether the expenses for the eldest son's secondary school education were properly excluded. 3)The mother set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses.

The case is also one of the circumstances where bank has restitution against a holder of a certified checeque as a payment did satisfy just a debt. As the defendants in this case had already deposited the replacement, and the certified cheques did not have a just bond, the claim cannot be defeated.

B-4 and codified the consequences of certification. In recognizing exceptions to the irrevable natureof a cheq, the commercial utility of certification at the requested request of a payee is maintained while providing recourse to bank where payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certificque. The claim may succeed where the payee gave no consideration for the payment, and such an action does not satisfy a just Debt. The Court must assume sufficient evidence exists to maintain credibility.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.

A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The Public Trustee, which was under the MDPA, was obliged to seek a certificate of incompetence from the psychiatrist who conducted the initial examination. The Trustee sought costs pursuant to s.38.3 of the Act.

These procedures contemplate medical examinations, requests for medical re-examination, review panels, judicial review as safeguards that person not lose the right to conduct his or her own affairs on the basis of the opinion of one person. Likewise, the criminal law with respect to its provisions on fitness to stand trial requires that such determination only be made following the trial, or on the recommendation of a professional review panel who review any psychiatric evaluations made with respect a person. 2)The court was not aware of any law that might suggest that the Act could be used to permit such an inquiry.

His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The 29 year old farmer was charged with uttering threats to cause death to his wife, mother and children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The wife had recently lost a son who had recently passed away and she and her son had been involved in a very bitter family fight. The accused claimed that his grandmother had told him that if he brought the police out, they would shoot them all and put them in plastic bags. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The application was allowed on the basis that the evidence of prior convictions was not relevant and that there was no evidence that the accused had actually said anything to the wife regarding the alleged threats. The Court found that the statements of the accused and his sister were true and that they were not intended to be threats. As the wife had no memory of what she said during the telephone conversation, she could not have missed hearing the accused say that. The court found that there must be precision as to what was said during a conversation and in what order. The words used and the meaning of those words were important. The evidence was properly explained to the jury."

The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence. Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence. The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.  2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000.

The appellants were ordered to admit new evidence and a new Trial. The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants. The Court also found that the proffered fresh evidence could have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the 'cause of the fire'. The appellant were ordered pay $285,000 plus tax and fees for the trial, to be taxed on double Column and paid on July 15, 2000. The action was dismissed on this ground.

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. 2) The costs were determined based on either whether the plaintiff's first counsel was experience and capable of handling the case, or whether a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. 3) The expert medical evidence introduced by the plaintiff could only be recovered from either party. The costs should not be based on both hardship or the degree of success. The expert's fee is not excessive and is recoverable from the defendant. 4) The medical report charge was not allowed. 5) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file medical practitioners' reports without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters. 6) Expert medical evidence expenses must be reasonable; the witness testimony contribution to the case and relevant to the issues are minor matters. 7) The expense of preparing the plaintiff’s report and attending a number of medical conferences was not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs such as that of a psychiatrist. 8) The claim for pain disorder was not properly advanced. The plaintiff was entitled to recover $1,000 of the fees paid for the expert’ s report and consultations but no part of the payment for locum tenens or his medical report.  9) The fees were not excessive. The medical reports were not entitled to taxation or allowed on a party’d basis.  10) The court reviewed the fees and the applicable tax exemptions."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused indicated that the motor vehicle accident occurred when he was in a motor vehicle. He had participated in a driving without impairment program. HELD: 1) It was not necessary to assess the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the context of whether the evidence is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the accused had committed the offence as alleged. The Court was guided by the principles restated in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1996), 141 Sask. R. 221 (Sask. C.A.) (R. v.) (B.C.A.). 2) The evidence is not sufficient to prove the accused knowingly operated a motor Vehicle while disqualified as alleged and he is not guilty. 3) It is necessary to determine the credibilityof the witnesses, who testified based on whether the accused was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offences as alleged, and to ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do not accept, you are convinced beyond reasonable doubts by that evidence of the guilt of the accused."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The accused brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. He also sought an order pursuant to ss. 119(1)(q) ofthe Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under provisions of the Youth Criminal justice Act, and particulars of the convictions. HELD: The application for change of venues was denied. 1) A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial.  2) Pre-trial publicity is not alone in allowing public bias to prejudge an accused's right to a fair and impartial trial. Pre--trial media reports and postings on social media and other media websites may have referenced the victim. However, no evidence of that would justify a change in venue. The presence of the fund and postings in the internet community may have made it more difficult for an impartial jury to determine the appropriate location. However the Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and found that a properly instructed Jury will be capable of dealing with the matters in the Court's Court on the Day of the Trial and the Court was not persuaded that such a jury could not be properly selected."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."
c_2007skqb355.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also apply for orders require the third parties TO provide further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which may be adduced tending to establish or destroy such a claim. The purpose of the examinations is to determine whether the third party contractor has received sufficient information to answer all questions asked on discovery. HELD: The application for further and greater disclosure of the documents is granted. The third parties are required to provide complete answers to all questions and objections. The plaintiff seeks judgment for the amount paid. 1)Examinations for discovery have been held by all parties. The parties have disclosed some of the information contained in the documents in their possession or control. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that, if necessary, he can be further examined on the responses. 2)The transport industry typically characterizes these relationships as a commercial relationship. The fact that the third Parties are not obligated to answer any questions or provide any further responses to undertakes raises a broad relevance test which requires a party to answer only questions broadly related to the issues in issue. 3)The purpose of this broad relevance Test is to serve in the adversarial litigation procedure. The examination for discoveries is to obtain facts and discover the case to be met. The court will not conduct minute examination of each question to determine its relevancy. The transport industry generally characterizes relationships for discovery as being one of convenience, not interest or convenience. 4)The third parties have not disclosed any of the materials contained in their power or control except for the names of the officers. The documents contained in a PSAC document relating to the use of cement in the performance of their contracts are not privy to the information. 5)The plaintiff seeks orders requiring them to provide full and complete responses to undertaking as provided in the following Queen's Bench Rules. The following Queen’s Bench Rules are relevant to the plaintiff’S application for discovery: 212(1)The governing legislation was The Education and Health Tax Act. The Education Act was replaced by the PST Act. Subsequently, the Education and Highways Act was passed. The TA Act was repealed. The PST Act was also replaced by PST. 6)The defendant was not bound by the terms of the PST."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions and child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines and in the amount of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses. Prior to the 2009 consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the father for increased child maintenance but had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. The mother now applied for a retroactive award of retroactive child support. HELD: The order was granted. The child was to have monthly child maintenance for three years and retroactivity of child maintenance ordered to the date of his separation. The parents were in receipt of approximately $900 per month in child support payments. The payments were made between 2001 and 2007. The current order requires a retroactivity to date of $350 per month. The son is to have weekly child maintenance of $1,000. The parties' income is determined by the father as a share of the child's expenses. The Father is to pay the mother $350 in monthly child support and thereafter $550 in monthly table amount. Subsequently, the father will pay $350 for 10 months for total of $3,500 and an additional $400 for two months at the rate of $400, bringing his yearly contribution to $4,300 and leaving a deficit in the sum of $2,304. The Child Support and Custody Act prohibits the use of the father's income as a proxy for the mother's obligation. The Court found that the father had 'effective notice' that his child support obligation had to be increased from the date the parties separated and that he had not done enough to ensure that the child continued to benefit from the benefits he had received since the separation."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of vehicle registered to the respondent seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for forfeiture of the vehicle registered in the respondent. The Director's decision was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The applicant and the respondent are common-law spouses. The director purchased the vehicle in 2010 with money received from her father's estate. Beginning in January 2013, the accused entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. He pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. He was sentenced to 12 months probation and 80 hours of community service. The Chambers judge was also at pains to emphasize that the Act does not mention matters relating to the deterrence of crime. HELD: The application is dismissed. The Court is not persuaded that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, remove the profit from crime and the need for compensate victims. The Act is a very rare case where a finding that the accused has used the vehicle for unlawful activity is not relevant. The case here was not one where exceptional circumstances were appropriate. The application for leave to appeals should be granted."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s.(23) ofthe Act and an order under ss.37 (1)(b) of that Act granting them custody. The Agency requested the additional information on the foster parents. HELD: The Agency's revised plan is appropriate in the circumstances. Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b)of the Act. As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is not an appropriate solution. The fact that the father has agreed to a long-term order recognising that he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable and nurturing environment to his children is more easily accommodated."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that it could not resolve the custody issue between the parties as it was a matter of factly and expeditiously. The court found that the petitioner was a competent and loving mother. The child was also remarkably resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The petitioner had a traditional residence with two bedrooms, one for the petitioner and one for her children. The respondent was to have one bedroom, one bathroom and one bedroom with an additional bedroom. The parents' relationship was marked by domestic disharmony. The children were exposed to this throughout their lives. The Court found that both parents were capable of providing a stable and nurturing home for the child. The primary residence was in Moose Jaw, which is where the petitioner currently resides. The petitioner described herself as a stay at home mother. She described her role as a parent as being to watch the children while they were in school and to provide support and encouragement to the petitioner in the mother's role. The mother's assessment was high-handed and suggested some considerable negativity existed at the date of separation. The shared parenting regime has worked well while the petitioner is a pre-schooler. However, this coming September Madison will be five years old and will commence school on a regular basis. The inevitable decision as to where Madison will attend school is imminent."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.",FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application is dismissed. SMI is obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants and is entitled to attempt to limit the liability of the plaintiffs. 2) The only way to achieve a conclusion that there was a breach of a contract or a duty to act fairly in good faith is to use the evidence as evidence. 3) The Court found that there is no evidence that SMI was in an adversarial relationship with the plaintiff's insuranceholders. 4) The facts as stated in the policy are plain and obvious that the plaintiff’s statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The Court was not able to determine the substantive adequacy of the claims. 5) The plaintiffs were entitled to rely upon the evidence of the other defendants. 6) The proposed claim against SMI for breach of contract was dismissed.

The Court finds that voluntary early retirement or the choice of a payor to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs for lesser pay do not constitute a material change of circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payOR’s obligation to pay child or spousal support."

The accused argued that the Crown had failed to make proper disclosure contrary to s.7 of the Charter and that the trial judge has misapplied the concept of reasonable doubt.

If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial. 2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event. 3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol and drugs contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. At the opening of argument the appellant abandoned all but the Charter matter and one defence arguing that there was no objection raised at trial over the nondisclosure by the prosecution of the telephone call, which was accepted. The appellant argued that there had been a breach of the Crown's Charter rights by virtue of the fact that the Crown failed to provide disclosure respecting the crucial evidence of impairment to the accused or his counsel after being requested to do so, thereby denied the accused's right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that even if the appeal was allowed, the trial judge could have been convicted on the other evidence he had considered.

d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The applicant sought to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that she would have sole custody of the 7 year old daughter and the respondent would not be removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of their mother since that time. The mother had indicated in her notice of motion that she intended to move to Kelowna to enroll the daughter in a Christian private school and she had discussed the possibility of the applicant buying some of the furniture that she did not need. She also indicated that she was interested in selling the furniture and allowing the applicant to move back into the matrimonial home in exchange for car payments. HELD: The child had a close relationship with both parents and the trial of an issue would be required. The court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community. As the child had no good reason to move, the court was unable to assess her relationship with her extended family. The respondent was a good mother and there was nothing to suggest that her move was either foreseen or would have beenreasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. While there was a possibility of disruption, the Court was not prepared to allow the applicant's move simply because of the timing of the scheduled conference."

The respondent applied for a restraining order restraining the Labour Relations Board from requiring a rectification plan for violation of s43 of The Trade Union act or for making further remedial orders related to the said violation of ss. 43 of the Act. HELD: The Labour Relations board's decision was quashed. The matter was remitted back to the Labour Board to be dealt with having regard to the decision of the Board on the basis that the closure was not a technological change within the Meaning of s 43(1)(c) of the trade union Act.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) of s. Charter to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. Defence counsel took the position that at no point along the way did he waive delay and the delay of approximately 7 months which resulted from his desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged was solely attributable to the Crown. Defence argued the delay was caused by the Crown's application to remove the prosecuting counsel from his position. The Crown argued the postponement of the preliminary inquiry was a reaction to a scheduling conflict and not a reaction by the accused. Defence took the view that the delay would not have affected his ability to make full answer and defence and that his reputation would not be affected. The application was dismissed. There was no evidence as to the cause for the delay or how it affected the accused's reputation.

The board held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act.

The appeal was dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipally, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant. The requirements for service contained in s. 63(6) do not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear a appeal from the Assessment Review Court. Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s63(6(have been enacted) can waive compliance with those provisions.

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a hotel employee who had been employed for ten years as front desk manager for the Delta Sydney hotel. She filed a grievance in February 2000 alleging that her work hours had been reduced due to a change in personnel. The hotel staff member, who had the most seniority of the three employees, went on maternity leave. The management of the hotel advised her that she would be given less hours in the front desk department than they did, and that she should be allowed to work fewer hours. She sought an order of the arbitrator for judicial review. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 is wide enough to encompass the situation. The appeal was granted on the basis of the finding that the interpretation of the clause is patently unreasonable. The court also sought the court's intervention to determine the appropriate costs of the appeal. The appellant alleged that the language used by the arbitrators was patently unrealistic and the court could not intervene simply because it disagreed with the reasoning of the arbitration board or because it would have reached a different conclusion. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed. The Court ordered that the appeal be allowed on the onus of determining the appropriate cost of the appeals and ordered that Article 9.01 be set aside."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.",The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer. The accused was on duty at 2:00 a.m. when the Citizens on Patrol Program personnel were on the lookout for a vehicle that was driving erratically. The police observed the accused use the telephone for a short period of time and then noticed him use the phone for a few minutes. He was asked if he had anything to drink and the officer advised him that he had had a little bit of beer earlier. The officer advised the accused that he should not drink and drive and advised him to watch for any problems. The conversation was short and he did not move towards the door. The refusal was attributed to anxiety attacks. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to reach counsel as was his right under s. 10(b) of the Charter and that the Intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece.

HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and was ordered to purge her contempt by paying the solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying access terms of this order. The application was allowed and the respondent was ordered not to exceed $1k per visit for an extended period. The limited access proposal of the respondent did not succeed because it virtually guaranteed that the petitioner and his parents would never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the mother had been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits.

The October 2003 order of J.C.H. was also vacated. It was held that the court was not in contempt for the August 2002 breach. The defendant was found in contempt because it would bring a significant reduction in the value of the petitioner's assets by significantly reducing the petitioner father's costs by significantly less than the petitioner would have cost him in the present circumstances. Due to the limited access order the respondent will not have to travel significantly to obtain the required level of support that would enable her to exercise access. The costs will be significantly reduced by a significant amount as the child will be able able to exercise some of the time that the parent would otherwise have to exercise in the absence of a significant sum of money. The reduced value of petitioner's own assets will provide a significant lift to the family.

The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.

The defendants sued for breach of contract, general damages and exemplary damages. The plaintiff's application to add or substitute another plaintiff was dismissed. The Court found that the plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for nine years.

The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied pursuant to section 753 to have the accused designated a dangerous or long-term offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long- term offender. HELD: The Court held that on a dangerous offenders application, the Court must now also consider whether the subject of the application might be a long term offender, despite the fact that the requirements of s.753 have been met. The Court proposed to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which interpreted the 1997 amendments differently from the English version. The court found that the statutory requirements for finding a dangerous person are set out in s.730(1) of the code. The sentencing judge may, on application made under this Part following the filing of an assessment report under s.786(2), find the offender to be long-Term offender if it is satisfied that the offence for which the accused has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence. The accused has three children aged thirteen, eleven and nine from three separate relationships. He has recently established contact with an Elder from his home Reserve. The issue is whether the sentencing sanctions available pursuant to the long-form offender provisions are sufficient to reduce the threat of public harm to an acceptable level, despite having been met by the Court of Appeal."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner father sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody with the father. The Court found that the father had failed to provide effective communications with either of the respondents regarding the child's future prospects or the physical aspect of the child. The petitioner’s future was uncertain. The court found that although the father and his wife had been close in age, the child had become more distant and distant from her mother. The respondent’d parents had moved from Nova Scotia to Alberta and the child’ s parents had recently been residing in Alberta. HELD: There was no evidence that either of these parents would be able to provide for the childs future. The child‒s motherd parentshould be awarded custody."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs applied for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogations; an additional order directing the defendant physician to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. The second application was withdrawn. The Court held that special circumstances existed permitting further examination. The plaintiffs were not required to respond either to the initial inquiry nor to any subsequent order. The court ordered that the plaintiffs provide any further particulars of their claim, either as an alternative to punitive damages or in an alternative way, to the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff also sought an order striking out three paragraphs of an amended Amended Statement of Claim for aggravated and punitive damages. HELD: The Court found that the paragraphs should not be struck as either as similar fact evidence or as an exception to privilege.  1)The Court was satisfied that special circumstance exist permitting further investigation and/or interrogatories. The application was adjourned sine die. 2)The plaintiffs sought particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of the defendant in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. The only evidence that would be relevant was the respondent's responses to undertakings.  3)The plaintiff was entitled to respond only to the first six responses provided by the applicant. 4)The application was also adjourned to the trial. The Judge was not able to determine that the application for aggravated or punitive damages was warranted."
d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applied to the plaintiffs’ amended claim. The proposed amendments to the claim were permitted by Queen’s Bench Rule 66 and that leave of the court under s.20 of the Limitations act was not required. The application could be brought on proper notice and supported by relevant evidence. The only issues were whether the plaintiffs required leave to apply for an order striking some or all of the plaintiffs claims on the basis that the pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action. The pleadings were not allowed. The plaintiffs could apply for orders determining that some of the claims are statute barred or, if it does that, an order nunc pro tunc should be granted extending the time in which the plaintiffs may bring their action."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave in June 2005. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the twins were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins arrived in Regina. The applicant resided in Saskatoon and brought an application for joint custody with the children having their primary residence with the respondent. The mother was to have access 12 days per month. The father in October 2005 brought an applications for joint sole custody with his children and payment of child support by him and an order that the respondent provide her three previous years tax returns and notices of assessment. That application resulted in the consent and parenting judgment. The parenting judgment determined the petitioner's income for child support purposes was $77,060. The child support payments were adjusted in the January 2007 parenting judgment based on the respondent's reduced Union dues. The only change was the father's income which had increased by $22,479. The court dismissed the application. HELD: The application to vary is dismissed. 1)There was no material change of circumstance. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that had been followed. The January 2007 judgment contemplated a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order. However, the petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him in this regard. The context of the petitioner’s 2009 income tax return showed that he had increased costs now that he has the children 50% of the time. However the cost of the children’ s care on that occurring was dealt with in the original order. 2)The only change is the father’d income which has increased by.22, which is not a material difference of circumstance as the change of the parent’S income on equal parenting were clearly provided for in the previous child support orders and parenting judgement. 3)The court was unable to retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge, and found that the petitioner had not met the on-us on him in the manner set out in the parenting judgment nor had established a material need for material change.

The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings.

The landlord argued the Hearing officer erred in his decision on the facts. HELD: The Court dismissed the appellant's findings of fact and that they were not credible findings of law. It was not the Court's role to determine the findings of truth of the appellant but to determine their conclusions as to their findings of credibility and whether they should be overturned on appeal. The Court reviewed the facts of the landlord's appeal and found it was not appropriate to overturn the decision of the Hearing Office hearing officer. The Landlord's ground of appeal was that the hearing officer was not responsible to pay all of the utilities that he found the tenants overpaid, $225 which was ordered to be paid as abatement of rent for the tenant's inconvenience of not having water being off and the repeated notes. The Hearing Officer was also in receipt of the tenant’s utilities. The court found the following were the findings as to the appellant’ s finding of fact: the hearing office was not liable to pay for the utilities, the tenant was not jointly or agreeded to pay, the landlord was not to accept all of her evidence, the Hearing was not bound to accept only the evidence of particular witness and not other evidence of that witness and the Hearing wasn't bound to refuse all of its evidence if agreeded.

Counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant agreed to seal the affidavit. The defendant argued that the affidavITS would further the harm done to the plaintiffs by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were involved in a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior student, including them, and that public disclosure of the allegations made by the defendants would exacerbate the harm which had been done to them. The defendants argued that since the plaintiffs were in Grade 9 and not in Grade 10, they were victims of a brutalzing assault.

The affidavits that speak to their effects on the young person and ramifications for others should not be sealed. The affidavit of JR, now in Grade9, was also sealed. J. G. KRAUS, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The public, including fellow students of the young people, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of affidavits speak to this effect. The effects of this assault on them and ramifications are to others since there are a real, serious risk that further harm will be further harm. Hearsay, R. v.

The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him that the officer had not made forthwith an ASD demand and that he was not afforded the right to consult counsel before the demand was made. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The Court found that the accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The Certificate of Analyses would not be excluded. 1) The Court held that once an individual's rights are infringed, the individual's s s. 9 Charter rights are not infringered. The Act is intended to provide a reasonable opportunity for the individual to have a firsthand look at the evidence obtained by the police in the course of his driving.

The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.

No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.",The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions. The appellant argues the Administrative judge exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI for matters wholly unconnected to the action. The Administrative Judge directed the parties to determine how the verification process could be completed without breaching solicitor client privilege. The applicant seeks to have the order struck as a discretionary order. The order is based on the principle that both parties agreed to the verification of the records and that the process is a procedural step to ensure the verification is complete. The administrative judge made no error in requiring MLG provide the information requested. The application for directions is denied. The respondent has not proven that this was a discretionary decision by the Administrative Court. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings.
d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","Liability: 1) The claim was dismissed. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff had indeed received the money as a gift from the defendant as it was a loan by the defendant and not a gift. The plaintiff had also lost $12,000 due to the defendant's inaccurate Record of Employment. 2) The defendant claimed for wages of $1,000. The payback of the loan as set out in the Statement of Claim was never taken from the plaintiff's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. The $5,000 was never paid back as wages. 3) The plaintiff could have made a loan to the plaintiff without documentation. The issue of damages was adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court as there were no damages incurred by the plaintiff if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. If she was unable to obtain the payments that she had lost, the Court would hear evidence on the quantum of damages to be paid by the applicant to the defendants Lilia. 4) The $1 million was never given as wages by the defendants. The statements of claim as to the $5k, $1k, and $5K were never issued. The defendant's counterclaim that she was overpaid for $5000 was not proven. 5) The defendants had the free use of the plaintiff corporation and the plaintiff was granted access to the company's records.  6) The balance of probabilities were not satisfied that the $1 thousand was a Loan as there was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which one would anticipate considering a corporation.  7) The amount of damages owed by the plaintiffs to Lilia was not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from ServiceCanada, the issue of damage to this aspect of the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned. It may be that there are no damages inflicted by the respondent if she can now qualify for payment. If, however, she is unable to get the payments she has lost, Court will hear evidence and argument on the Quantum of damages awarded by the applicants to the applicant Lilia Lilia in the defendant’s action.  8) The applicant was entitled to damages as a result of the $2,000, $5 million and $1K,000 of which $1000 were given as gifts by the Defendant as well as a repayment of advance.  9) The statements filed by the wife"
d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. He had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court meeting despite a previous order to not do so. The accused had sold cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250. The court found that with this not being a violent offence and with the accused having a limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act or (c) a deferred custody and supervision order. The Court also found that the accused had visited Kikinaahk Friendship Centre, a popular gathering place for older children and adolescents, and sold narcotics to undercover police. The police arrested the accused when they approached him for assistance. The Crown had not released the accused on his current probation order. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a 6 month deferred custody order on all three counts. Pursuant to s. 38(1(d), the accused is subject to a custody order. Pursuit of this order, therefore, has failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society. The most aggravating factor is the fact that the youth was only 1 month into a probation order after having been convicted of possessing cocaine. Notwithstanding that probation order, the youth is back in La Ronge, selling cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The aggravating factors are that the Crown failed to show a remorse or accept responsibility for the harm done to the community. The youth has spent the last month in custody. The maximum sentence that can be imposed is a 6 year deferred custody ordered on all 3 counts."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. HELD: 1) The mother's move with the children is an interim basis. She has formed a new relationship with the father and he is currently incarcerated. While the father has been in jail for a number of months, he has not seen the children for the last few months. This is one of handful of cases where an interim decision on mobility is appropriate. 2) The court is of the view that the children's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent and that this be done here. While preserving an access relationship and maximizing contact between the children and both parents are to be fostered in the ordinary course, this situation is far from concluded. This court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's interests. This matter has not gone to trial and is far too concluded. The court's expectation that the mother will do all in her power to ensure the children have this access is not diminished by the incarceration of the father. 3) The move is not for job, nor for any other sort of economic opportunity. But are such economic benefits considered to outweigh the considerations of the formation of a new family? Surely the collective interests of the children should be as important as enhanced career prospects have been in other cases. Here, not only has the mother formed a relationship with a man from Kenaston, she is pregnant. Her ability to act as parent to her two existing children will necessarily be impacted by the arrival of a third. She cannot reasonably be expected not to feel the impact of the move being prevented if her new life partner is not living with her. 4) The Court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two young people visiting their father in jail would benefit. This case is far away and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. The Court's only issue is to determine the childrens best interests, and the focus is certainly not on the rights or interests of either parent."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.

The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta by Fraser- Brace. The trial judge found the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the insurer that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian was therefore not liable. He ordered Hartford to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. The appellant had no obligation to pay the fire loss as Delta was never, never at risk for fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or Fraser-Bace for causing the fire."

The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter transportation. The defendants admitted to having requested the helicopter transportation be provided to the plaintiff but denied that they had actually done so. The plaintiff sought to have the helicopter transport examined as a matter of fact. The defence claimed the claimed privilege was too broad and prevented him from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses. The court found that even though the helicopter was not ordered to be flown over the safe altitude, the information was relevant because it was pertinent to the overall issue of unsafe operation. The case law clearly states that if the defendant, which was in a position to defend its liability for the accident, was in, in fact, in a situation where it was, by providing the safety net to its employees, would be subject to liability for any error. The helicopter was also relevant because its location was at a remote location from which it could be difficult for the plaintiff to orient herself visually. The claim for lost profits was dismissed. The plaintiffs were awarded leave to reapply for direction. The Court found that the theories advanced by the defendants were not relevant to the present situation. The application for discovery was dismissed as there was no evidence that the plaintiff had obtained insurance to cover the costs of the helicopter rental and that the insurance policy was not obtained by the defendant or arranged for the use of it. The defendant corporations were not permitted to answer questions as to insurance policy or whether the insurance policies were obtained through the use or payment of a carrier. The issue of liability was not raised by the pleadings but rather by the evidence."

The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor on the premises. The club was operated under a'special premises liquor licence' which allowed its use within the restricted use of the premises for the purposes of a lounge license. The development officer at the time determined that the lounge license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public. As the club was a private pool hall with a special purpose liquor license, the development officer determined that its use would be a 'change in use' which would result in a change in the liquor license for the club. The application was allowed on the basis that the change in liquor license would only affect the applicant's use of one subcategory of the drinking establishment, a club which served food and drinks and persons of the same age and gender. The license was not for the purpose of a club. It was for a lounge licence. The establishment was a club and the license was a change of use which would have the effect of permitting the establishment of a 'lounge' within the permitted use of that particular zoning area. The proposed change in license would not affect the establishment's use in the sense that it would allow its members to have access to a variety of different types of alcohol. The lounge license would also allow the establishment to display its wares. The only restriction was that the license would be for the sale to members of a particular club only. The liquor license was valid for use in all of the restricted uses within the approved zoning area except for one or more uses. The restriction was lifted when the applicant applied to have a development agreement entered into with the applicant."

This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was hit by a van that had been used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff, now 30, sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His lawyer prepared a Statutory Declaration for the plaintiff which he swore to secrecy and gave to his client. The client, who had obtained a Section 133(14) of the Insurance Act from the plaintiff, admitted that he had no idea who the driver was, but that he assumed that he was the owner of the vehicle. The Court distinguished between the plaintiff's version of events and that of the driver of the van that struck the plaintiff and his own version of the events. The facts were very much in dispute and credibility findings were required. The only clear evidence before the Court on the identity of the defendant was his own. The court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the Van to the plaintiff. Hence, he retained lawyer to prepare a Statute Declaration for him to use as a witness. The Statutory Statement was never produced nor was it given to the client. It was a copy of the original Statutory declaration which was never issued to the court. The Certificate was never obtained nor was there any evidence offered by the client as to its ownership. The defendant's version that he sold the van to the victim was completely unreliable. The fact that the documents were never produced was a significant issue in the trial. The inconsistencies in the defendant's evidence were significant."
e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada. The Bank had been in the business of leasing goods for more than one year. The respondent had made a loan to buy out the Bank's security interest in all of its present and after-acquired personal property and equipment, and had been engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of pothole patching machines. The bank had been paying the Bank security interest for a term of more than 1 year. It had not obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. The applicant had made an assignment in bankruptcy. HELD: The Court found that the Bank was'regularly engaged in' within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it was not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s3. The lease was therefore 'a lease for a more than One year' within that meaning of the meaningof the PPPA and it required registration.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents (defendants), the defendants, and the Village of Bjorkdale. The appellant contended that Justice Rithery had erred in granting the motion to withdrew the case. The action arose out of burns suffered by the appellant while participating in a demolition derby run by the Bjorkton Lions Club with the assistance of the Bjorksdale Fire Department. His right hand and arm were badly burned. He suffered burns when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. Having come to the conclusion that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury, the jury could not rationally have concluded that either caused or materially contributed to this extent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. There was no tenable basis to interfere with the decision of Justice Rostery."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The original custody judgement provided for the joint custody with shared custody with the child being born in 2001. The respondent also applied to have the custody transferred to his current residence in Yukon. The mother opposed the application for sole custody, but maintained that she was willing to work towards joint custody and shared parenting with the father. HELD: 1) The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined in the original judgment and evidence of the new circumstances. The primary reason for moving was because the respondent was looking for employment. The secondary reason was that the child was not well adjusted socially and emotionally. The child was exposed to the world outside of Saskatoon and would be more secure in Whitehorse if the father were allowed to move. The evidence from the trial confirmed the respondent's parenting skills, the strong bond he forged between himself and the child and the desirability of maximizing contact with both parents. The desirable of maximizing the contact between the child's parent and the Child and Access parent was also discussed. 2) The respondent was granted sole custody of his child, with scheduled access to the child. The Custody and Access Order, dated June 8, 2005 provided for interim custody with a specified time. The Original Custody Judgment did not provide for shared parenting. The Joint Custody Order, 2006 provided for that child to remain with the parent whose custody it had become accustomed in the new location. The trial judge proceeded with the trial on June 7, 2005. The father filed a further application on December 8, 2006, seeking an order allowing him to relocate with the Child to Whitehorse for residential purposes. The Child and access parent filed a Notice of Motion in 2006. The Certificate of Custody was issued for Shared Custody. The Father applied to include the child in his custody plan. The Court was satisfied that there had been a material change in the circumstances that would allow the father to move with the children. The Children and Access Act, 2006 s. 282(1) and s. 283(2) of the Code provide for a shared custody order for the child, which provides for the sharing of parenting with a significant financial benefit to the applicant. The Family Law Act, 2004 SKQB 275 states that the Court shall not interfere with a child's access to a third party. The Criminal Code has provided for shared custody since the time the child left Saskatoon. The"
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.",This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member who was involved in the creation and operation of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina but was now pursuing an M.D.(Ph.D.) in Education. He was also involved in planning and organizing a symposium. The decision to withdraw an invitation to the applicant to appear at the symposium did not involve any parties to the collective agreement. The application was dismissed with costs.
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The first access issue was for an order that would enable the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second access issue concerned the child's father's employment schedule. HELD: 1) There was no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The father had worked every day for two weeks then one week off from Saturday to Tuesday. Given the age of the children and the fact that he would be laid off for two months in the spring, his contact with the children should be increased. 2) Access was not a variation of the previous order. It was a variation in the nature of an extrapolation."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective counsel of the complainant. The matter was remitted to a trial judge, who determined that the accused would not be entitled to the assistance of the lawyer assigned to represent him on the assault charge. The court found that because the complainant had not been represented by a lawyer who was not a lawyer and who had raised concerns about the lawyer's representations through the trial, there was no miscarriage ofjustice. The lawyer's lack of ability by itself was not the ground for determining that a miscarriageof justice occurred. The process in this case was developed to determine whether a accused who is represented by an agent who is not a law firm is entitled to that standard of representation. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact. The appeal is dismissed."

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(2.2) of The Criminal Code.

HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","HELD: The Court held that it did not believe that the respondent had the ability to pay child support. It determined that the child support application was adjourned pending reporting by the children's psychologist and that the petitioner had not shown that the father had the means to pay it. The interim child support obligation was increased to retroactive to September 2010, based on the respondent exercising access and having not shown any disability preventing him from working on the pipelines. The mother must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. The father must immediately find employment and find work to support his earning capacity. The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were adjourned for review by the interim order made in August."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused's identity was established on an Appearance Notice and a Notice of Intention to Appear. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible. The Crown did not tender the Certificate of IntENTION to Appearing.

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.",HELD: The Court held that the exhibits were admissibles. The Court found that the accused had not been properly categorized and that the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not a possibility at the time of the trial. The trial resumed with the assistance of the Crown. The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of search of the accused's computer and cellular phone. The issue of exclusion of the evidence pursuant s.24(2)(a) of a Charter breach was not determined at the trial as there had not yet been sufficient evidence presented of either the nature of the information seized nor the location from which it was seized. The determination of admissibility was to await completion of argument on s.25(2).
