Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant.  2)The Information sworn in support of the application failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search.  3)The information was found to be hearsay information from a confidential source and no details were provided in supporting the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information was reliable."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. Subsequent to the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board, the appellant gave birth to a child. The municipality provided assistance since the birth of that child. In defining persons in need, the committee must have regard to s. 19(e) of the Act and s. 1(m) and 2(1)(d) of Municipal Services Code. The respondent's stepfather is the head of family maintaining the home for herself and a dependent child. HELD: Appeal allowed without costs. 1) The appellant's application for assistance was dismissed. 2) The trial judge erred in misapprehending the municipal social assistance scheme and M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5 in particular.  3) The respondent did not qualify under either of the earlier provisions of the social assistance act or the Municipal Social Services Act."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff had disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocable letters of direction dated March 9, 1987 and March 16, 1987. The court found that the plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust on this ground. Allowing the claim and dismissing the claim, that there was no evidence the plaintiff was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by them or purporting to act for them or on their behalf."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.  1)The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably-justified as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice.  2)The Court was satisfied in the circumstances and nature of the case that the picketing ban term of the original order was reasonably justified.
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files, the death of Dr. Leakos and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years. HELD: The application was dismissed and costs were to be re-reserved to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff had not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. That very significant delay is a factor that must consider, but only one."

The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing .

The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","A 12 year old girl was sexually assaulted by two juvenile offenders at a roller skating rink. The defendant Broadcasting Company was responsible for all the news information aired from the station. The station was awarded $12,500.00. The plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed with costs. HELD: The court found that the defendant Broadcasting Co. published the news that it received from the police, which was always a proven reliable source. The court did not find any errors in the information provided by the police or the plaintiff's solicitor."

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.

1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he had consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The appellant's evidentiary burden was not raised. While the trial judge may have been referring to the evidentiary load, he went further and stated that he did not raise that reasonable doubt. With respect that was a fundamental error of law and the appeal was granted. The Court was therefore awarded the appeal and ordered new trial. 2)The trial judge was entitled to rely on the presumption of accuracy."

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant.

1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner. At trial, both parties were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home. The final paragraph of the judgment reads: ""[18] Although this Court has ordered that the petitioner is entitled to exclusive possession, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home.""

The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct.

HELD: The application for leave under s.7 of The Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court is granted. The applicant requires leave of this Court under s7 of the Contributory negligence act to be treated the same. The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as third party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant."
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, the accused requested that the Court enter into a voir dire. HELD: 1) The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest' of the accused, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused considered himself deprived of his liberty to go where he pleases. His continued detention after the alleged 'de facto' arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. There was no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'unarrest'. The accused was not the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his rights under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The Court held that even though the police had made a conscious decision not to arrest the accused on another complaint of disturbance, their treatment of him amounted to a 'dejure' arrest and not an arbitrary detention. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, he was in fact the accused throughout had insisted he was the only person in the apartment who was not in custody at the time of the arrest. The court found that there were several ways to contact Legal Aid by telephone, but there was no actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention, and the former does not need to, and does not, overrule the latter."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. HELD: The accused was guilty as charged. 1) While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a'marked departure' from what is expected for reasonably prudent drivers. 2) The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct. It can be concluded that the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road. 3) The accused's conduct was marked a departure from that standard expected by a reasonable person in the accused's situation."

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The Union applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party or as an amicus curiae, or alternatively as an intervener, and to bring an appeal from orders made on September 23 and October 1, 1999 in proceedings brought by the Union against Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendant(s).

HELD: The Union does not have the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court. The Union also relies upon Rule 8.02(2) of the Judicature Act and Rule 62.35. It is the rule governing interventions to this Court by persons who are interested in an appeal. There are no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as a defendant pursuant to Rule 5.04. Prior to the decision in Adams, applications for intervention at the appeal level, in civil cases, were made under Rule in combination with Rule 7.

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his daughters were entitled.

The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","This was an appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. It involves the question of whether something affixed to a realty is fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial) acquired title to house property and caused to be affixed by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for a wheelchair lift loaned to the Jabours by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for their disabled foster child. The wheelchair lift ceased to operate a few months after San Diego acquired the house property. The Abilities Council said the wheelchair lift belonged to it. The Jabours negotiated a purchase of the lift at a depreciated value for $2,769.29 for which they were awarded judgment. Although it was not a finding of the trial judge the manner in which the Act judge applied, the appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party."
2_2002nspc20.txt,"The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees. A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent pled guilty to 12 counts of failing to comply with the provisions of s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act by failing to remit to the Receiver General of money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of the Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited. The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to s. 238(2) and the imposition of fines in relation to these 12 counts. The respondent operated the company with another investor. HELD: A compliance order fell within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order similar in nature to a fine or restitution order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out in s.178(1)(a) of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Such matters were unaffected by an order under that Act. The court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to the provisions under s.238(2 of the income tax act is unaffected by bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. The matter was adjourned to receive further submissions from counsel for both parties. 1) The Crown's position was that the Crown had jurisdiction to issue a compliance order. 2) The authority of the Court to make such an order was irrelevant. 3) The respondent was relying upon an investor of H.R.P.S. and/or the accountant of that company to make the deductions and necessary remittances. The implicit inference to be drawn from those submissions was that either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more responsible than the respondent for these offences. Expressed in another fashion, the Crown, in light of the guilty pleas, need not establish the existence of the matters set out by s.227(2)."

The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of NsC Diesel Power Inc.

The testimony and documentation presented since the Subpoena was quashed do not provide any basis to compel his attendance. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The defendant has not proven that his Charter rights were violated. 2) The evidence which has been available during subsequent testimony and from the documents which have now been provided does not support those beliefs expressed by the defendant. 3) There is no evidence that the OSB, under the Superintendent, did not pursue investigations into other parties' conduct and deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. 4) There has not been any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of other persons involved in the bankruptcy. 5) The application could be characterized as a request for re-consideration of the decision to quash the subpoena in light of additional information which have been provided. The reasons which provided when giving that decision canvassed the involvement of Mr.Redling and other persons in the OMB in relation to Mr. Black's affairs, and explained the basis upon which determined that Mr Redling was unlikely to be able to provide relevant information concerning issues. The evidence that those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the defendant's attendance."

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs in this proceeding where, after a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties were to share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent was to have access with the children every Tuesday and Wednesday from after school until the end of the school year. In the interim, the parties agreed that the children would remain in the respondent's residential care until further order of the Court. HELD: The Court found that it was in the children's best interests to be in the primary care of their father effective the last day of June 2005. The Court also found that the respondent had demonstrated an indifference to the best interests of his children and that the Court was to consider what appropriate interim order should be made at this time. The court also varied the order for child support payable by the respondent to reflect his current income."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward.

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused, and immediately took steps both to assist the accused by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused did not swear at the officer and did not threaten to sue him and cause him to be fired from his employment. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that the Crown had proved that the driving by the accused was careless. Here, we have a pedestrian crossing road adjacent to a parking lot, and while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, he is struck by that vehicle as it rolls forward into him. As he was crossing the road, he backed up to where the complainant was standing, heard someone holler and then reversed to his position to find out what his concern was. There was no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to stop his vehicle. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the complainant's vehicle, and secondly, his driving forward into the complainant."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, while her breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station.

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.

The appellant's counsel argues that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has not proven that Fleury drove through the stop sign on Highway #11.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds, both 19 years of age, were convicted of robbery with violence.

These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances.  3) The sentences were increased to three months in secure custody, nine months of probation on each charge to be served concurrently and four years concurrent in the amount of time served in a federal penitentiary.  4) The offender's criminal record consists of two robbery convictions, one for robbery with intent to commit an indictable offence under s. 351(2) of the Criminal Code and four months of imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claimed $25,000 for damages for a claim for damages that the disclosure statement did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. HELD: The motion for non-suit was dismissed. The court found that there was insufficient evidence, if believed, to satisfy a reasonable person that the case could be resolved in the appellant's favour.

2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. In all of the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife.

2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The petitioner and the respondent both requested an order to seal their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media requested that the file be sealed to protect their reputation and to allow the Maintenance Enforcement Program to find a payor of spousal or child support or to issue garnishment against wages or income tax refunds or to suspend driving privileges. Both parties requested access to the court file after delivery of written notice of the request for access. The sealing order was granted. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances. The public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. There is a social value to be derived in the expectation of privacy in the context of a court file. There must be some social value or public interest of superordinate importance in order to achieve justice. There are circumstances where the court must be open to public scrutiny to ensure that justice is done. This is one of those circumstances where a public interest must give way to a general interest in confidentiality. The applicant and respondent have both raised one proposition that has been decided: that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected. It is privacy interest. The risk of identity theft is real. The parties themselves have not provided an 'affidavit' with facts supporting the proposition that they have an expectation that their personal identifiers will be provided when necessary but remain undisclosed to the public. The court cannot police the later use of the names of innocent persons. The presumption, however, is in favour of public access and the burden of contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right."

He became unemployed again in 1993. 3)The parties had reached an agreement which reduced the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month, which amount was paid from August 1989 up to 1993. Further agreement was made increasing the monthly maintenance to $554.13 and further increasing the maintenance in January 1994. The quantum of the arrears was determined to be in excess of $55,636.21."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of a child alleged to be of unsound mind. HELD: The order was granted. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, this Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child and she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. In certain jurisdictions Public Trustees have by statute been given specific authority to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However, that does not fully determine the issue. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult and adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act.

3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff commenced an action under the Mechanics' Lien Act for unpaid monies, which in the end consisted primarily of claim for extra or additional work which had to be performed because of alleged undisclosed site conditions. Shortly after commencing the work Turf Masters, by then called Granview, the City, and third party indemnity claim by the City against CBCL which alleged negligence or negligent misrepresentation on the part of CBCL. The plaintiff commenced a quantum meruit against the City alleging breach of the standard of care, negligence on part of the city, and breach of contract or negligence against the third party. The city commenced a second action against the plaintiff, this time against a third party for non-disclosure of site reports, alleging negligence or misrepresentation by the city and that the city had abandoned the idea of an international calibre soccer field and instead proceeded with a recreational park with some playing fields. In this second action, the plaintiff requested certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court found that there was no final decision or judgment on any of the issues alleged by the plaintiff to be the subject of issue estoppel. 2)The court found that the plaintiff should have raised the point now asserted in the second action in early 1993 and well before trial. It appears to have been well aware of the factual basis for the present allegation and that only certain aspects of negligence had been decided by the previous decisions in the first action. It was satisfied that to allow Granview to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept which it considered but did not proceed with would be an abuse of the process."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"This was an appeal of an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant objected to payment of these amounts only because the respondent never consulted him in respect of incurring the expenses. She erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(a). HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under the Guidelines was set aside. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can not see that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s9 of the Guidelines; (b)the appellant's income should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott had no business based in the home."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The Crown argued that the language used by the RCMP was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. HELD: 1) The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner to taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.  2) The words of the individual provisions to be applied to the particular case under consideration are then to be read to be interpreted in their grammatical and ordinary sense in light of the intention of Parliament, the object of the Act and the scheme of the act, and if they are clear, unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law, that is the end of the charge. 3) The police act is a vehicle under the Crown's jurisdiction. The police are responsible for policing when there is an agreement between the province and the federal government. It is not appropriate for the legislature to limit the opportunity for policing of community by making sure fewer police officers are able to act in any particular setting within the province. 4) In reviewing the scheme and object of The RCMP, it is clear that section and section of the RCMP operate to render the police officers part of 'police force for Canada' and peace officers 'for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' 5) The language used in the RCMP Act provides for the protection of the accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by Section of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or detained. 6) There is no good public policy reason for the police officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. 7) The officer was not acting in the lawful execution of his duty if his stopping of the Abrametz vehicle should be regarded as a random stop. 8) The evidence showed that the words “are assigned” refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where a police officer is employed within the Province. 9) The court concluded that the police act was clear-cut, broad- unambiguous, and the words were reasonably capable of bearing that meaning. 10) The Court concluded that there was nothing in the"

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.

The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.

3_2004skca49.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.

HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT: The respondent applied to vary the custody and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. At that time, the respondent was the sole custodian of the 13 year old and the matter never proceeded to trial.

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.",HELD: The accused was found guilty.

The accused admitted that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and that his selection of the accused from the photo ID line-up was from his memory of the person who committed the robbery. There was no other explanation for the request for the false evidence to be given other than the fact that the accused had not been at the club at that time and that he had not seen the robbery victim.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.

The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. 2) The pleadings determine whether or not the insurer has a duty to defend. It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment. The fact that the plaintiff subcontracted with the general contractor for the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit does not, for the purpose of this appeal, change the intentional nature of the acts."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff is making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the defendant's affidavit, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the health of the plaintiff. Judgment is entered against the respondent as to liability for the accident itself and not causation. The driver of the rear car must rebut presumption that the collision occurred as a result of his negligence. The defendant argues there has to be an 'air of realty' to the plaintiff's argument. HELD: The appeal was allowed and set aside. The costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were costs in the cause of the action."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","This application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005. The parties were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in 1993. They entered into an agreement in February 1996 that the biweekly payments would be reduced to $2,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father provided financial support directly to the mother. In July 1996, the respondent requested enforcement of the amount in the original order. She received $10,000 in November and December 2005. In January 2006, maintenance was discontinued. The respondent's monthly expenditures are not excessive. They include the secondary school expense for his children."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). In the alternative, they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: The application to add the plaintiff was denied.  1)The court was not satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. 2)The plaintiff had chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It was their position that the plaintiff has done nothing to prosecute this action since filing the Statement of Claim. The court should not terminate the order or revisit the issues which the parties intended to resolve through that order. The addition of the plaintiff would not create a wholly new proceeding."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The defendant was found two-thirds and one-third responsible for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000, including non-pecuniary loss of pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life, in the amount of $25,000. The defendant contended that the award to the plaintiff was in excess of five years following the accident and was withdrawn less than month later. The court found that the offsetting negligence was negligence that contributed directly to the accident. Although the plaintiff had been successful on her counterclaim, her recovery was less than the doctors had expected. The Court held that the trial judge should have exercised his discretion to adjust the interest rate so that it was not taken into account for a second time."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 was dismissed. The Crown argued that the findings of Klebuc J. did not exonerate the accused, but rather that certain of the express findings of the trial judge raised issues of res judicata or issue estoppel in relation to the matters now alleged against the accused. In these circumstances the Court has power to order that single count be divided where it is satisfied that the ends of justice require it. The application is dismissed.  1) The Crown argues that the facts raised by the application raise substantively the same question as that of whether the Crown would consider a single transaction rule or, alternatively, to order the Crown provide particulars. 2) There was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound, in its proceedings against the applicant, by the findings in the Schafer case. 3) It is important for the Court to examine the extent to which the conclusions of the Court in that case can be said to provide support for the argument, for, on proper reading, the findings are a permissible relaxation of its terms extending to exceptional cases in which number of acts each in itself constituting an offence is capable of being treated as one transaction. 4) The Court is not bound in this proceeding by any factual or legal determinations."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997.

The court found that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent.

5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of motor vehicle and was found to be intoxicated. The Crown appealed the voir dire decision. The accused testified that after the roll-over, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. The defence argued that if the accused was given a police warning, it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. HELD: The Crown conceded that the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of this belief, its admission would render the trial unfair. The evidence obtained though process of self--incrimination will generally be excluded in order to ensure the accused has a fair trial. The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed to look behind the curtain and see what the accused says. In this case, the accused's statements were self- incriminating and conscriptive. He testified that he was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. He did not remember the officer placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. He had no recollection that the officer following up on those excluded statements was also in breach of his section 7 rights.  1) The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused’s s. 7 rights and was self incriminating. 2) It is useful for me to divide the series of statements that were made into groups. Those before the arrest and those given after. Those given after are instructive as to the effect of the continuing belief the accused would not have been obliged to answer the questions under the compulsion of law. 3) The officer was not acting in good faith and was co-operative throughout. Perhaps, that is why he approached the officer in the way he did and was cooperative throughout. However, he had no memory of being placed under arrest and advised that he knew his rights and understood the warning."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","This is an appeal from the Small Claims Court's decision wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants.

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08 on the following grounds: 1) The trial judge ignored evidence that the appellant did not require assistance for her to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser. However, there was evidence provided by the officer that she was smoking a freshly lit cigarette which, in the officer's experience, was a tactic sometimes used by people to hide the smell of something. The officer noted that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow and the appellant pulled over appropriately after being signalled to do so. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol on their breath but out of nervousness or other cause. The judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the appellant's belief that her ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. 2) The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The court dismissed ground one of the appeal on the basis that the appeal court failed to consider whether there was a breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter rights and the standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. The appeal court also dismissed ground two on the ground that it was based on an error of law, failure to consider other cars that had previously turned, and the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant sought a Voices of the Children report in order to ascertain the respondent's wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: The application was to have a formal judgment issued and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, the applicant seeks a Voice of the Child report be prepared. The conflicting affidavit evidence makes it clear that Julie's views are not being reliably communicated to the court. An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the court in determining a custody and access plan that is in the best interests of the respondent."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.",HELD: The Court held that it could not determine whether a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The Court found that the respondent was the only person who could reasonably reasonably conclude that the offer was in writing and that the formalities of the Statute of Frauds had not been satisfied. The court also held that there was no evidence of a breach of the contract.

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances created a reasonable apprehension of bias which resulted in a denial of natural justice. In the conduct and carriage of civil actions the law requires a fair and impartial hearing.","This was an appeal of a Family Court decision which set aside the trial and remitted the matter for a new trial. The appellants sought to have the custody of the two children returned to them to their natural parents. The trial judge, acting pursuant to the Children's Services Act, authorized the appellants to apply for the custody. At the time the trial judge made the ruling, he continued the case and rendered a decision awarding custody to the natural mother and the younger child to her father, the male companion of the mother. All three parties were represented by their own counsel. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although certain conversations were held during the course of trial, they raised a reasonable apprehension that the judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly, would have decided the case before he heard all the evidence."

Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a Chambers decision granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant contended that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge was nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. That may or may not be the case but for the purposes of securing full disclosure in this proceeding which is the one with which we are concerned, it is insufficient reason to limit full disclosure."

The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","HELD: The application was allowed.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There is reasonable apprehension of bias such that the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury has been violated. 2)Challenges for cause are desirable and the court will permit counsel so wish providing that a list of proposed questions is presented to it for it perusal by 930 a.m. Thursday October 1st, 1998. It may be that such an exercise will lead to the discovery that noimpartial jurors can be found but until this exercise is attempted we are left with mere speculation as to the effect of the publicity."

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000. She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000. HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled. The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years. 2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The respondent was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order the respondent had been unemployed by reason of health problems and arrears of child support were constantly accruing. HELD: The respondent was restrained from disposing of any money that he had received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without further order from the Court. The Court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. The court ordered that the respondent's counsel, the Merchant Law Group or any new counsel shall pay the settlement proceeds into Court in accordance with the above."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT. The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. HELD: The application is allowed. The court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The respondent is a bona fide purchaser with no notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation. At the time of the purported reservation of title in favour of the respondent, no subdivision of agricultural land was permitted in respect of an area less than five acres. The person claiming to be the rightful owner of the interest had done nothing for 20 years, both parties to the transaction had died, and the action was between the executors of their respective estates. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue in this matter is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.

The parties are largely agreed the visitor has exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes which are governed by the internal law, policies, and procedures of the university. The University has policies and procedures related to such supernumerary residents directed at ensuring that wealthy students simply not be permitted to 'buy' their way into one of the training programs.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The Crown sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend a pre-sentencing conference scheduled to take place in December 2006. The Crown argued that the conference should not be open to the public and the media. Counsel for the Crown and the young person, who appeared before the Youth Justice Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over the past 14 months. Defence counsel on behalf of the Crown sought to exclude the public from the conference. HELD: The Court held that the public's interest was a broad concept and included the impact of the criminal justice system on youth offenders and the resulting interface between the family and all members of the public. The Court found that the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The court found that, in all but exceptional circumstances, our courts be freely accessible to all. The public and media have a right to attend any court proceedings subject to the discretion of the court to exclude them. This is evidenced by numerous provisions in the Youth Criminal Justice Act which speak to the adequacy of government programs and services for the youth."
7_2006nssc131.txt,"The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed. Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","This was an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on June 27, 2002. The deceased was driving his bicycle on the road when he was struck from behind and killed. The Plaintiff was present although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident, she commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. HELD: The Court concluded that such a result was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.  1) Section 139 of the Insurance Act regulates the insurance coverage which is to be provided by insurers licensed to sell automobile insurance in Nova Scotia. Because it is fact of life that loss and injury occurs as the result of the operation of uninsured motor vehicles or drivers, the Act establishes a scheme for the protection of persons who suffer loss from such an accident to that of physical harm. The impossibility of contemplating the extent of the potential liability constitutes a valid reason for not distinguishing emotional damage resulting from a death of a person insured under the contract.  2) It is instructive and in keeping with the case law that claim for damages surviving under the Fatal Injuries Act does not include claim for emotional distress or psychological injury which might result from the loss of a loved one."

Given that Mr. McLaughlan is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment towards the outstanding maintenance payments.

7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The Crown appeals the acquittal of the charge under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2). The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","HELD: The court found that the respondent was in contempt of court for failing to comply with the court order. The court ordered the respondent to pay $15,000 in contempt costs. The respondent had not complied with the order and the court ordered him to vacate the property and to return the equipment to its proper storage location. It also ordered that he remove any equipment that remained on the property contrary to the Zoning Bylaw and to dispose of any items that remained thereon contrary to it. The order was made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 [Act].

7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.",The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse and friend following a trial before a judge and jury. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning in relation to either witness. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The evidence presented by the Crown and the defence did not support the appellant's argument that a warning should be given. The court found that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to give a warning in respect to the testimony of both witnesses. 2)The appellant's evidence was not corroborated by the evidence at the scene. 3)The evidence was found to be so unreliable that it could not be given to the jury. 4)The Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal. The Court found that a discretionary decision is not warranted.

Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the Board for a rehearing, that the Court found that the decisions of the Board were not patently unreasonable."
8_1999canlii3182.txt,"This was an appeal to determine whether a Provincial Court judge is obliged to advise an accused of his right to a trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada, pursuant to s. 530 of the Code. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that s. 530(3) of the Code is mandatory.",The issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either of the official languages of Canada pursuant to s. 530(1) of the Criminal Code. The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial either in French or English pursuant to Section 530(3). The appellant's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his access to the trial in his own language is not procedural error. The trial judge had no discretion and was obligated to put the appellant the right to be tried in either language.

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The Plaintiffs sought an accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The Court found that the petitioner was mentally competent and completely able to manage her own financial affairs from 1992 until her death in 1999. The only evidence that suggested she was not mentally competent was that of the Plaintiff's mother, Brenda Anne Doherty. The Plaintiff was physically infirmed and unable to easily get back and forth to a bank. The petitioner would cash cheques for her mother or make cash withdrawals at her request and bring the money to her. The Plaintiffs were jointly and severely liable for payment of these costs which may be deducted from their entitlements in the estate."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: The child support order was registered pursuant to The Children's Law Act, 1997 S.S. 1997, c.C-8.2 as am. The Family Maintenance Enforcement Office is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. In the absence of something further I am not prepared to impute income."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) The applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion. The consequences for inaction parallel those of defendant who is noted for default as a result of his failure to file statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. 4) The Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 5) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 6) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding. After an allegation is made, it becomes an enforceable judgment if the proper steps to dispute it are not taken within the specified period of time. In numerous cases wilful blindness has been held to not constitute sufficient reason for the Court to grant an extension."

It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: 1) The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752. The Court found that the accused had less active role and he did not smash windows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. 2) Sentence concurrent with a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by seven month supervision in the community.  3) The Court reviewed the 2008 amendments in R. v. Warawa, 2011 ABCA 294 (CanLII), 278 C.C. (3d) 409 (C.A.). The wording in section 753(1)(a)(i) has changed from'may' to'shall' making the finding that an offender is dangerous mandatory once the statutory criteria are made out. A predicate offence must be'repetitive', one episode of violence will not be enough under the new legislation."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.",HELD: The Court found that the accused were guilty of breaking and entering and committing the offences of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown relied on the information contained in the pre-sentence report as well as the submissions made by the witnesses. The court found that both the accused and the victim of the assault were at medium risk to re-offend. The accused had not filed a victim impact statement with the court and were not overly co-operative with the Crown once they were out of custody.
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Child and Family Services Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for their interests. The court arrived at its conclusion by applying ss. 11(a)(1) and (b). The evidence disclosed that the father had taken no measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues. He resiled from that guilt in his conversations with the children. Nothing has changed with the father."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.",The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act. The respondents also requested an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of the Act. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order of the Court set aside without costs. 1)The respondent's affidavit evidence was admitted on an application for final order by reason of which the matters were based primarily on information and belief and contravene Rule 319 of the Rules of Court. 2)The chambers judge erred in law in granting the respondent standing for the private enforcement of a public right and in finding that the KSS project was development as defined in s2(d). 3)The respondents deposed they were concerned about potential changes to the environment likely to be brought on by the intensive hog operation. All the details of the hog operation were not important for the purposes of this appeal. 4)The court found that the respondent's affidavits were not in breach of the Rule and those portions may not be considered.
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of the respondent's family physician. The respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with E.F. her former counsellor. The Minister sought production of the notes and reports of psychiatrist who had treated the Plaintiff. The Respondent argued the higher standard used in criminal proceedings to determine relevancy should apply to child protection proceedings. While the Supreme Court refused to make a characterization, this 'unique amalgam' impacts on the question whether there should be a different threshold when determining relevance in a child protection proceeding. The criteria for the claim of privilege based on confidentiality are those of a higher standard, namely, that the information is logically probative to an issue at trial or for saving costs and is not injurious to the public interest. HELD: The application of Rule 69 is dismissed. The court found that the order of production requested was absolute or partial, depending on what is required to strike the proper balance between the interest of protecting the communication from disclosure and the interest in proper disposition of the litigation."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources sought orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 but in view of the respondent's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial.

The court ordered that the respondent be placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act and that he be placed with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest (P.S.I.) until his 18th birthday. The petitioner did not oppose the applications in respect of [J.S.] and [E.K.] but sought the return of [C.S.'] to her care. 1) The children have the same biological parents, [T.K.], [J.'S.]. The respondent does not seem hateful toward his parents. He did not seem to be scared of his parents but he did have a habit of rubbing his hands when he was nervous. 2) The respondent is not a person having sufficient interest in the child. 3) The Court ordered the respondent to remain in the care of the Department for a period of 3 months on the following conditions: the respondent shall have generous and flexible access to the children, J.S., (C.s.) and (J.K.) whether they remain in their care or in a Departmental foster home. The child shall have access to his grandmother. 4) The order was made to have the respondent placed with the respondent until age 16 pursuant to the Act."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. He commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. With one exception, the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. HELD: Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal dismissed. Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the Protocol and the Government's related use of the AU code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. Such matters, according to the appellant, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. 2) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. In this case, the Protocol is best characterized, perhaps among other things, as means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. 3) The Protocol is obviously an individualized administrative process. However, do not accept the argument that it is a payment schedule uniquely applicable to the physician."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the accused was not attending school because he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The accused was found not to be in the public interest. Given the circumstances of the offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, the Court was not persuaded that his release would be beneficial. The appellant's release so soon after being sentenced would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged as follows: that between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on two young girls. The Crown requested a sentencing hearing pursuant to section 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. The accused agreed. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that both victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove that digital penetration occurred. The Court was satisfied that these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. 1) The accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. 2) There was no medical evidence and no corroboration of digital penetration. The first aggravating factor was that the accused may well have started by feeling and rubbing the victims over their clothing, and repeated that he was inside her. As the victims got older and the accused became bolder, he went to feeling and touching the victims under their clothing and kissing them hard on the mouth. His penis became erect. He breathed heavily. He touched the victims' breasts under their clothes. He rubbed his erect penis against her vagina. 3) The Crown must prove each of these aggravating factors beyond reasonable doubt."

The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge gave sufficient reasons for her decision and took all of the relevant evidence into consideration.

Dmytryshyn on the charge under s253(2)(b) of The Traffic Safety Act. HELD: The appeal is granted. 1) The trial judge gave sufficient reasons for her decision and took into consideration all of the relevant evidence and the law in reaching her decision. The appellant contends that he was unaware that an accident took place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he did not know had happened prior to returning to the store.  2) There was no palpable or overriding error."

Dismissing the appeal, that the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time within which an application could be made was not one which the prothonotary had power to give. The order of May 19, 1992 conclusively resolved the issue of the timeliness of the appellant's application. It was not disputed that the protheotary did not have jurisdiction to grant the order purporting to extend the time from the date of the sheriff's sale to the amount owing to the plaintiff at that date determined in accordance with the provisions of the order for foreclosure and sale.

He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed. Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.

His automobile was struck in an intersection. Although he was not hospitalized and never required surgery for his injury, he was completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment for which he was suited by education, training or experience.

It was for all of these reasons that the judge rejected the report. 1)The plaintiff's financial records show that he had devoted his life to the farm and the other business ventures which he managed to initiate or develop. He was driving. His wife was front seat passenger. The plaintiff was not injured. 2)The court found that the plaintiff's injuries were so severe that they rendered him permanently disabled from the duties of his employment and for all employment that he was capable of engaging in. 3)The Court rejected the respondent's report. The respondent's evidence was so strong that the Court could easily have engaged his own expert and furnished report long before this. The Court found that it would not be as likely that all of the assets valued could be sold at their market value to a single purchaser."

This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug.

The plaintiff was found to be solely responsible for the accident and was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. There was no evidence of any cause for concern. The evidence of the plaintiff was that the defendant had been travelling at a reasonable speed when the accident occurred and that she had not seen the defendant vehicle from the start of the accident. The defendant had no neck or knee complaints prior to the motor vehicle accident and had no history of low back pain. The only issue was the location of the impact and the speed at which it occurred.

The respondent submits the Constable was not on trial, that the Learned trial Judge's comments dealt with the police in general and not the specific actions of Constable Stiensburg, and that the respondent hoped for and received a fair trial.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal has an obligation to defend. On November 19, 1993, McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether Royal was obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not decide the issue of indemnity when he engaged in determination of which insurer was obligated. The chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy. 2)There was no evidence in the affidavits filed before the chambers judge that the McLeods resided together. 3)The court was in as good a position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act. 4)The Court was not in a position to decide that the duty to defend arises when policy clearly does not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. HELD: A non-custodial sentence was justified. The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional centre. Taking all of the factors of sentencing into account, it was the sentence of the Court that was reduced to an 18 months sentence. The Court was of the view that the accused would never re-offend in the future.  1)The accused had no prior criminal record. The victim lost her job in the community and was ostracized in the town. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the offence. The court was of a view that he would never again offend in any event. 2)On the other hand, the accused referred to the new sections in the Criminal Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-violent sentence. A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. 3)The sentence must be served in a Provincial correctional centre as the accused was a model citizen until the offence occurred."

There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT.

The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.

The respondent shall have access on each Friday that is not attached to his access weekend except when such Friday is the petitioner's earned day off. 1)The petitioner was prepared in the initial stages to be more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact. In the beginning the respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. When the petitioner requested weekend for herself with the children the respondent would agree only if the petitioner gave him more mid-week access in lieu. 2)The respondent was responsible for the breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. 3)The parties were to agree by June of each year on the division of summer holiday period. 4)The court accepted the characterization that these were both very good parents.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","HELD: The application was based primarily on the respondent's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. There was no dispute on the facts that just over 22 months had passed since the date of the first preliminary hearing and the scheduled trial date. The Crown conceded that the delay had been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.

A further oral request for disclosure was made at the first court appearance in May 1998 but was not received until later in the day on May 26 and too late to be reviewed prior to the scheduled court time on January 6, 2000. In the second preliminary hearing in June 1999, the Crown indicated that it would have full disclosure by the end of October but the delay was so severe that it was impossible for the respondent to prepare for the proceeding.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. At various times the plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. The plaintiff agreed to defer payment of his account from the parties until the successful conclusion of the litigation with SCIC, provided he received interest on the amount outstanding to the plaintiff at rate of 12% per annum. HELD: The court found that the respondent was bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The court was also struck with respect to portions of the examination for discovery which placed these statements in context. The respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, have any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was acquitted. The Court held that the Daviault test was not a valid defence to an assault type of charge as the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. It was difficult and sometimes dangerous for the accused to place much reliance on the evidence of witnesses, including complainants and accused persons, who come into court and testify about events that arose from drinking alcohol as beverage or abusing drugs. It would not be satisfied in the rare case in which the ingestion of alcohol or drugs was involuntary, such as by means of spiked drink or forced injection."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in finding the court had lost jurisdiction under s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code as the record is clear that Justice had issued a summons within three months of the loss of jurisdiction, so that jurisdiction over the accused had been maintained; and 2)The Court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued here before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over him in Alberta. The matter was adjourned for hearing."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT.

The StarPhoenix's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD in their sentencing submissions because Mr. Jones entered a guilty plea. Now, the journalists wish to view that evidence. HELD: The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Court of Queen's Bench is the appropriate court to obtain such relief. The Attorney General did not oppose the application. It merely sought the court order to release the CD to the applicant. The court was also advised that it must apply to the appropriate Court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access.  1) Both counsel agree that the presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. 2) The appropriate court is the Queen’s Bench."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT: This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in April 1998. In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendant embarked upon the project but after time ceased the work and the plaintiff abandoned the project. HELD: The plaintiff was ordered to post security for $18,000 for fees and disbursements. The amount of the security was reduced to $1,460,246.10. The court found that the presence of the counterclaim did not impede the plaintiff's ability to defend against the claim. 1) The presence of a counterclaim precludes the plaintiff from exercising its discretion to vacate the action. 2) There is no absolute prohibition on the granting of an order for costs where the claim and counterclaim are related. There is a general rule that 'no security will be awarded where there is a claim or counterclaim is not an absolute bar'. 3) The respondent commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action, long before filing a defence. The counterclaim arose out of the same motor vehicle accident and include all the parties involved in that accident. 4) The plaintiff is called upon to defend the within action brought by the plaintiff. This is case where the plaintiff not only is a non-resident party but there is real likelihood that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful. 538(c) is a factor to be considered, albeit a compelling one. It is not the case that the Court has no jurisdiction to do anything more. The Court has discretion to make a determination based on the facts and evidence in this case. 539(d) is an absolute prohibition."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","Counsel for the respondent was of the view that, even if his conduct constituted a breach of the clause prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.

The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","HELD: Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed and the conviction set aside. The court found that the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the complainant’s home and the search of the premises without a warrant.

The reasons for the appeal are inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter must be remitted.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appeals a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer in finding the tenancy agreement was not a fixed term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act.

Tenancies Act, 2006 in finding that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term and that a one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month tenancy following the end of the fixed term.  2) While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was difficult time to rent the premise, the fact is he did not try, because he had decided it would be better going forward to have a furnished premise for rent. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the fixed position of one year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012."

The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school.

There were numerous photos of boys wearing their beaded jackets, moccasins and beaver mitts in spite of the accusations by some that these were taken away and never returned.

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The landlord claims damages for negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in losses to the tenant's restaurant. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464. The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. Although the evidence shows that a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor."

The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders of FCC approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of The Business Corporations Act. The plan proposed a liquidation and dissolution with provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The Director of Saskatchewan Corporations opposed approval of the plan on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets according to their respective rights on dissolution and s. 220 directs that property distributable to shareholders who have 'proven claims in establishing their status as Shareholders rather than having portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA.' HELD: 1) It is my opinion that s.(186.1) is here being used by FCC for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. 2) The court can exercise its power under s. 210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in ss. 220(m). The context within which this is provided must be considered. It is just and equitable that the court in this case is given the power to override the mandatory directions contained in s220(1) of the CBCA. Given the decision by Saskatchewan and other provinces to pass business corporations' legislation that essentially replicated the BCA, have no difficulty in finding the Supreme Courts analysis in BCE to be equally applicable."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.'s parents for an indefinite period of time. The Minister also suggests a temporary order for custody to be placed with the maternal grandparents as persons of sufficient interest. The issues in this matter are relatively straightforward and can be identified with two questions: 1) Is the child in need of protection? and 2) if so, what is the appropriate order to serve C.R.’s best interests.  2) The evidence was presented through the testimony of six witnesses: the two child protection workers assigned to the case, both of whom are now deceased; the Ministry assigned child protection worker, Ms. R. (who is in her late 50s and has retired from her previous occupations); the Ministry submits that neither of the parents have been able and willing to provide sufficient stability, both in their lifestyle and behaviour, that they would be able to resume parenting. 3) A temporary order was suggested, of up to 1 year, under s.37(7) of CFSA. The Ministry's position was presented primarily through her testimony. Despite the candid admissions that she is in a much more positive way, she expects she will be in position to parent in the near future."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with fishing for or for sustenance in violation of s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, 1995. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused was not guilty of the actus reus charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish for food in any water and at any time he so chooses. The court found that both the accused and the co-op were Treaty Indians and that they had a common law right to sustenance fishing."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court of Appeal held that an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by the commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel, including the totality principle and the Gladue factors, and concluded that the global sentence should be similar to those imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. The Court also considered the three cases where the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim, two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12."

Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.

The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.

c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff had waived its right to a solicitor-client privilege by making voluntary disclosure or consented to disclosure of documents sought by the defendants prior to the discovery of the plaintiff. The documents sought were found to be in the possession of the defendant's former solicitor, Peter Muttart, Q.C. who had represented the plaintiff in the planning and financing of the project. The plaintiff asserted that the documents sought, and indeed all of the defendants' evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor client privilege. In this factual situation, the waiver may be reasonably inferred."

The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances.

The Young Person was unrepresented and he had no prior notice of the application. The Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of the latest decision to make a continuation of custody application. HELD: The application was allowed to continue pending a full hearing. The court found that there was a marked departure, procedurally, from our previous experience under the Young Offenders Act. It was instructive to refer to the relevant portions of the Act, sections 98(4) and s. 99(7) as well as the governing criteria for continuation."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","This case involves a professional negligence claim being advanced by the plaintiff against her former solicitors, Michael Tochor and E. F. Anthony Merchant (as well as a related corporate defendant). The defendants were engaged and retained to represent the plaintiff as her lawyers in respect of four charges laid by the College of Physicians and Surgeons against her; three charges alleging she engaged in the practice of medicine and one charge that she provided medical treatment not being registered under the Medical Professions Act, 1981. She elected trial by judge and jury and to be self-represented. This trial began April 21, 2003. The plaintiff's Statement of Claim alleges various particulars of negligence and unprofessional conduct against the defendant lawyers. Particulars of negligence were set out in paragraph of the claim and the plaintiff sought to support these by the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has presented no evidence upon which the jury could decide whether there is any evidence, if left uncontradicted, to satisfy a reasonable person. 2) The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of the case, applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non-suit. The jury would have to decide whether negligence caused the plaintiff to be convicted on one or more of the charges. 3) There is no expert evidence that has been presented to the jury to provide opinion evidence to assist in the jury's task without some expert opinion to explain what the standard requires and how it applies to the work of these trial lawyers. 4) The court found that the nature of the issue can be decided on the basis of ordinary knowledge possessed by the jury or, on the contrary, the matter requires expert evidence because it is beyond the ken of the average juror."

HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court was presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the petitioner and the respondent. HELD: The application was refused. 1)The terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There was not equality in bargaining positions between the parties. The petitioner was content to receive assets mainly in the value of her car, which represented her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the respondent's share. The respondent was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000. The Court must refuse the application. 2)When, upon the evidence filed, the terms appear to be patently unfair, it is the Court's duty to grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. 3)The parties do not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It is certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of judgment or contract. Another option is to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there is no lawyer prepared to sign certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons."

He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.",HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. Application for fresh evidence was dismissed. The court found that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that procedural orders under appeal should not have been made.

c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","WESTFAIR FOODS, a corporation that was charged in an information that stated the following: 'THAT Westfair Foods Ltd. doing business as Extra Foods on or about the 25th day of August 2003 at or near the City of Melville, did unlawfully furnish a tobacco product, to a young person in a public place, contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act, S.C. 1997, chapter 13. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, the sentence vacated and an acquittal entered. 1) By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.  2) The evidence showed that prior to the incident, Westfair had an established system to prevent the commission of the offence of selling tobacco to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. 3) The trial judge was required to consider what reasonable person would have done in these circumstances to avoid this offence. The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that before the incident on August 25, 2003, before the defendant was operating a grocery store in Melville under the trade name of Extra Foods, the defendant had a system created to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors and that the defendant took all reasonable steps to avoid the offence. 4) The defendant failed to show that the conduct took place without its direction or approval, he implied that Westfair must be able to prove that there was nothing else that could have been done by the company to prevent its employees from selling tobacco. 5) In order to resolve this issue, the appeal is allowed. The conviction is allowed and a verdict of acquittal is entered."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit in the downtown warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. Building permits had not been obtained nor had condominium titles been raised at the time of the sale. The appellant sold the unit to a third party purchaser for $25,000. The Chambers judge found that the appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrarable interest. It is unnecessary to address the issue whether specific performance was available to the appellant. It remains only to consider whether the respondent had not filed a statement of defence at time it made the application, and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings.  2)The appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against a surface parcel owned by the respondent. There was nothing in her order or her reasons which indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. There is nothing flowing from her decision that either expressly, or by necessary implication, disposes of that question."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. The issue was whether the Crown has shown that Chisums requires such a licence. The court found that the process utilized by the defendant was more than simply harvesting as it was defined in the legislation. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The logs delivered to the defendant would be cut as logs used for log homes and are not true tree length. The processing facility was not a retail lumber yard but rather a lumber yard. The Crown did not show that the defendant required such a license."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","This action dealt with the placement of two brothers who were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents. The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The brothers had special needs of some sort, even high needs. The mother of the boys opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. HELD: 1) The Court found that the boys were in the best interests of the children and that they were at the lower end of the scale of outrage. The Court determined that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. Where the Court is of that view, it may make a long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until age 18.  2) It is fair to say that when he was in prison he received extensive counselling and through the three year probation period. He even continued counselling after the three years as he thought he was helping the counsellor with the others in the group. It is not the aim of the court to choose the course which will best provide for the healthy growth, development and education of a child so that he will be equipped to face the problems of life as mature adult....” (para. 70) There was considerable evidence from the family concerning photographs (P-3) and activities he undertook apparently between 1992 and 1999. During that period, he was engaged in a photography business where he would take photos of young women, in various stages of dress and undress, so they could put together modelling portfolio. He would charge no fee. Although he had no social skills and did not know how to play with other children, he did know he was the father of two children. He did not have a criminal record. The photographs were taken in the process of taking those photos. Although his wife was always in attendance, it was he that would attend to that aspect of preparation. The business ended in 1999. 3) The court found that it was incumbent upon the parents to look firstly at s. 37(1) which requires determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with person of sufficient interest, or with the Minister for a temporary period not exceeding 6 months. Although the Court was of the view that the children would improve over time, the Court concluded the Stevens home met the necessary standard. It was not necessary to remind the Court that it has a"
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","FIAT: The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay the required amount for two children based on his income of $140,000 for the months from May 2008 to April 2009. The parties did not define how such a guideline income is to be determined. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. 2) The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father's 2008 income. 3) The parties were working from the husband's income for 2007. At that time the husband was working for Conexus and had gross annual income in the sum of $117,000. The father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. The mother had substantial legal fees to pay as result of the court proceedings in this matter which included an intense pre-trial conference. The severance is included as part of the dad's income. 4) With respect to the capital gain shown on the father’s 2008 income tax return, it is clear that there has been a change in the residency of one of the children of the marriage. It would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in that amount when the evidence is clear he will earn approximately $100,000 less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father must continue to pay support from May 2009 to at least April 2010 based on the actual Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am) (the “Guidelines”) income for the father which income would obviously be determined after income tax returns were exchanged. 5) The mother was requested to establish her 2008 income so that the appropriate recalculation can be made. 6) It is clear on the evidence before me that the father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. The legal obligation on an employer is to give adequate notice of cessation of employment. Severance pay is simply payment in lieu of that notice."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court found that he had at least some recollection of the events and that there was not any possibility that he would be able to participate in his trial in a meaningful way. The court also found that the accused's cognitive capacity might limit his ability to give ongoing instructions to counsel in relation to and in response to the trial.
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: ACS seeks an order from the Court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., within seven days of service of the order compelling production of the shares. HELD: 1) Given the totality of what is before me, I do not consider a valid solicitor's lien to have been made out.  2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if still in possession of them. In this case, the argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained. The claim for lien is not made out in this case.  3) The court ordered the law firm to produce and deliver up to Prince Albert the shares of the plaintiff. It is as creditor that the plaintiff instructed the sheriff, Judicial Centre, to make seizure of his shares in order to collect the outstanding debt."

At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking, possession of cocaine (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana (cocaine) for trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused had a previous drug related record. He was not married, had no children nor was he employed at the time of the offence. HELD: 1) The accused was given credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent on remand. The amount involved was $16,325.98 which was transferred to the accused's legal counsel at his request to pay his legal fees. 2) The Court found that the accused was a compliant prisoner, had minimal disciplinary issues and was qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The Court concluded that the circumstances justify the maximum credit allowed pursuant to s719(3.1). 3) The court gave the accused credit of 1 and 1/2 days.

The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim their damages are $5,975.95 but acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. HELD: 1) The counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs.  2) The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the necessary repairs and $100 for the lost use of tools. The plaintiffs claim the cost of 22 hours of their own time with respect to cleaning, Mr. Harder at rate of $40.00 per hour and Mrs. Evin at rate at $22.00. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs sustained loss of income as a result of their cleaning efforts. In fact, the plaintiffs were paid by their employer for the time they took from work to clean. 3) The defendant was awarded judgment for the $580.00 that was attributable to the counterclaim for the damage to the plaintiff's home caused by the defendant's negligence. The plaintiff's claim is reduced by 10% or $294.00 in the circumstances.  4) The plaintiff was awarded recovery of their cost to hire Country-West Builders to repair the deficiencies in the defendant’s work. They claim their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost to issue the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:(a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or(b) the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. HELD: 1) As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could lead the court on its own to strike. The plaintiff is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. In addition, this is not matter that is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. The delay from May 2006 to May 2010 is a delay from June 2011 until May 2012. The defendant has made its case and ordered those specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed. The stage of litigation is at which it could well go to pre-trial conference. It is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its Own to strike the claim. The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling and it is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. As the defendant is retired and the prejudice he will suffer in mounting his case if the matter goes to trial is not prejudice to him, there must be exceptions to the blanket privilege for settlement communications. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The normal criminal rules of law apply. The usual criminal rule of evidence does not apply. It is not necessary to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 2) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for decision. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. 3) The court found that the usual rule of law applies to this hearing. The court held that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. 4) The Court held that it was not intended that the provincial court judge strictly apply the rules of the evidence. 5) The standard of proof for the trier of fact is correctness on a question of law."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track) supports the Plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the onus is not on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, the Plaintiff has not done so. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus to prove that the defendant had anything to do with putting the substance into the alley or that it came from the defendant's property is on the plaintiff to prove the defendant was responsible. 1)The defendant has access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. The town employee called by the Plaintiff testified that he had used Ally and may have mixed one little strong with one strong strong. There were no similar issues anywhere in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through a back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause of the damage. 2)Having read the report and having heard the evidence of Patrick Frith, am satisfied on balance of probability that the substance, either through run off or leaching from the yard got into the plaintiff's lawn and killed it. Photographs, as well as the evidence given by Wendell and Sandra Charbonneau and David Panasiuk, further support this finding. 3)The onus on the defendant not to establish an alternative source of the offending substance is on him to prove it is the substance that killed their lawn and not the defendant."
d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through nation wide outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. For example, the total revenue from sales for the Atlas agency at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, had declined from $700,000 in the early 1980's to $450,000 during 1983-85. It reached the point where it was no longer independent but had to be combined with Metro. When the appellant conducted an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with regard to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people, the appellant knew from the outset that the franchisee was expected to donate his time for nothing. The trial judge found that the appellant was in possession of figures prepared by Ritchie and his staff. Ritchie had altered the projections of the appellant's staff to reflect the realities of the franchise and the appellant had no concerns of the projections or the viability of the operation."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron contrary to s. 344 of the Criminal Code.

HELD: Leave to appeal permitted, the appeal allowed, sentence set aside and in its place sentence the respondent to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for 1 year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The sentence is not fit. 1)Although there are some mitigating circumstances here they are not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence. 2)The respondent was prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of the respondent's release from imprisonment."
d_1997canlii10919.txt,"FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997. The eldest resided with her mother. Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved the decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. The respondent's 1996 income included the following: Employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was less rosy. She is currently in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits of $318.00 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she can obtain. Her employment with Bartch Building Movers, which yielded her $781.66 per month, was terminated. As her income from casual employment is sporadic it is difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. Now that this payment to her has been terminated, it is reasonable to assume that that amount will revert to the respondent, thereby increasing his receipts from the company over and above his stated income."
d_1998canlii12460.txt,"The plaintiff was for 15 years the Town Clerk of the defendant municipality. He sought indemnity for legal expenses he incurred as a result of charges he faced for violation of s. 368 of the Criminal Code and s. 27 of the Municipal Affairs Act. The criminal charge was dropped when he plead guilty to Municipal Affairs Act charge, of diverting money from the special reserve fund for an unauthorized purpose. The defendant counterclaimed for monies it had already paid to the plaintiff. Awarding the defendant $13,502, and the defendant $5,351 on the counterclaim, that the defendant should not reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the plea of guilty on the Municipal Affairs Act charge, as the plaintiff admitted to his mistake. They should reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the criminal charge, however. In committing his mistake, which was honest and not done for personal gain, he was performing his employment duties.","The plaintiff was an employee of the defendant and over the substantial portion of that employment he acted as Town Clerk and Chief Administrative Officer. In this proceeding, he seeks indemnity for legal fees he paid for legal expenses incurred as a result of charges he faced for alleged violation of s. 368(1)(b) of the Municipal Affairs Act. The defendant counterclaimed for an amount of $11,717.94, which were legal fees remitted to the plaintiff and paid by employees of the plaintiff under an alleged mistake of fact that the plaintiff was acting in the course of his duties when the event which gave rise to the legal fees occurred. HELD: 1)There is no question that any improper or unauthorized or unlawful act was not done for his own personal gain. 2)Every one who, knowing that document is forged, causes or attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act on it, as if the document were genuine is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding sixty days. This was common ground between the parties. The common law doctrine of respondeat superior recognizes an employee as an instrument of his einployer's will. An employee cannot seek indeinnity for expenses from his employer which arose when the employee broke the law. Performing tasks outside the law says the defendant is outside the scope of duty. It is fundainental to the case, defendant counsel argues, that if the employee breaks the law 'he is on his own'. 3)The common law is that an employee acting within the scope and scope of his employment is an instrument. The employee is to be reimbursed for losses, liabilities or expenses incurred when the action arises when the employer broke the Law. 4)The evidence took on this type of directness. There was no question, and I so find, that the unlawful or unauthorized act of any employee was not a done for profit act."

The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","HELD: The Court found that the deceased’s will was found to be in the best interests of the residuary beneficiaries.

He taught law at the University of Nova Scotia. He received a Fulbright scholarship to study medicine in the United States. He had made no reference to the deceased. He lived in a farmhouse in New Haven, Connecticut. For five years after his death he lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, working part-time as a lawyer. He and his wife, who was a nurse, moved to Nova Scotia after completing their doctorate. They lived in Nova Scotia for five years. They had two children. One died in 1997 and the other in 1998.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: The court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 1) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one. 2) The defendant has the right to expect employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called his son, Cory, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, and another fan as witnesses. HELD: The accused was convicted as charged. 1) The first question was answered in the negative. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up from which the bodily harm resulted. 2) Was the assault a contributing cause of bodily harm, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause?  3) The second question was asked in the affirmative. While the assault resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. 4) The Court of Appeal found that the deminimus test of causation did not violate the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice or of being too vague."

The defendant was well aware prior to the commencement of the action that the process used by the plaintiff was clearly a technology licensed to it by Bigquill. 3) The defendant is attempting to assert that it somehow has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles known as ion exchange and crystallization. The fact that the defendant developed its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties and not Big Quills demonstrates that it was not the only source for such technology. 4) The applicant is also seeking an interlocutory injunction to restrain and prohibit the defendant from producing or marketing any potassium-spiculate produced at its plant. 5) Costs of this application.  6) The court reviewed the Affidavit sworn June 29, 2000 in relation to the within application and make the following comments: 1. The applicant has been the President and Director and Shareholder of the defendant for the past 3 years. The plaintiff has not paid any funds whatsoever to the defendant under the terms of the Technology License Agreement and/or the exclusive marketing agreement and as result thereof, the within litigation was commenced in February, 1998. 7) In addition to the Confidentiality Agreement, the defendant has not been able to establish prima facie case that the ion-exchange technology licensed by BigQuill is the technology used to produce potassium- sulphate. The court is also required to pay the fee specified in the Act. 8) The Court is required to determine whether the plaintiff has a contractual or other relationship with the defendant and whether the parties involved in the action have a contractual relationship. 9) The facts of the matter are set out in Exhibit A of the affidavit."

HELD: The appeal is taken from a decision of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998. 1) The appellant is a retired Chief Supervisor of the Nova Scotia School for Boys at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. He was aware of the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that Inquiry. 2) During the course of the investigation, the appellant arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions. The statements were to be signed by all persons interviewed which releases contained consent for use. The review process did not include an opportunity for persons against whom allegations of institutional abuse had been made to respond. 3) Throughout the entire ADR process there was much publicity and media attention. While the claimants were being spared the publicity of public trial and, more importantly, cross-examination by experienced defence counsel as to the validity of their claims, the province's response to the allegations was that of a summary process driven by the applicants/complainants. 4) In many respects as of December 6, 1996, the process may be considered a nightmare for the appellant and other former dedicated employees of the school for boys. This is where the appellant's nightmare began."

On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored.

In her analysis she made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge thereon. The acquittal because of reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.08 at the time of driving. It is inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the judge on those facts, which are his sole province, to say that the appellant did not see any indicia of impairment.

d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis. There was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. Cross applications were filed by the appellant seeking orders to terminate spousal support, to sell the matrimonial home and to return certain personal belongings; and to provide an interim order for the payment of support arrears and a reinstatement of her benefits under his medical insurance plan. The appellant appealed the Chambers judge's decision claiming a reversible error on the part of him to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties. At no time did the appellant quantify the division of property he is looking for, let alone express the view that he is seeking an equal division of all matrimononial assets, or specifically half of the home equity. The facts and history of the case are obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear them."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","HELD: The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the parties to be in custody and that the issue of custody would be heard by the Court first with the financial issues deferred to later date. The respondent was 65 years of age and retired. He drove a taxi from time to time. The parties lived in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately ten minutes walking distance from the children's school. The petitioner had learned to speak English fluently, had obtained a Bachelor of Social Work degree from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and now worked part-time as a social worker. The court found that the petitioner had been primarily responsible for their care throughout most of the marriage. However, there was considerable disagreement between their parents with respect to their living arrangements. Divorce Judgement was issued."

The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive and that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: The evidence was admissible. 1)There was no Charter breach. 2)Evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications was not relevant. 3)If there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4)The accused's application for exclusion was dismissed. 5)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it does not violate s.8. The Crown had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had committed offences under s.271(1) and s.273(2)(c) of the Criminal Code.

The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath. He considered the totality of the evidence and found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand. The appellant's belief was based on the observation the appellant was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night as well as all the indicia of impairment referenced above. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which Cst.

d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The defendant was found not to be a dangerous offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment programming. The evidence established that the defendant vacillated between three positions involving the sexual offences. The court found that during the dangerous offender hearing, the defendant failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender. The defendant appealed.  2)Costs of the sentence were reduced to $300,000."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross-appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The fact that the statements were posted at the Hospital and on the Union's website is not so intimately connected with the process as to justify the extension of the defence of absolute privilege. Furthermore, the extensive publication destroys any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege because the words were published, meaning they were communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. The words expressed by the Union would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. 2) There was no basis for concluding that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error by finding Dr. Rubin had in fact been defamed by the publication of the allegations against him."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (Clarke), to answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. HELD: The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Clarke should not be required to answer the question. 1) It is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages, and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. 2) The court found that when the defendants moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 3) The plaintiff is obliged to provide answers to questions which it believes relate and do not relate to the derailment. 4) There is nothing in Clarke's refusal to provide a response to requested undertaking 38 that is inconsistent with the principles outlined in Rule 5-31. 5) The Court found that it was not obligated to assist the plaintiff to answer questions related to the plaintiff's claim or to the cause of action. It was also not necessary for Clarke to provide responses to undertakings 28, 39 and 40 as it did not have a position on what caused the train derailment and if they had developed a position they would advise the plaintiff. The plaintiff was also required to provide proper responses to all of the undertakings. 6) It was not necessary that Clarke provide answers on the basis of his current knowledge. 7) Given the answers provided at the time of questioning, it is not reasonable to assume that Clarke's documents in respect of which it could have claimed litigation privilege waives any claim of such privilege as regards background information to the document. The Court was also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons the court should not require Clarke to answer."

The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff claimed damages from overhanging trees on his property. The defendant argued that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood was generally in favour of them. The plaintiff argued that debris from trees caused the filtration system in his pool to be clogged lowering its life span and increasing service requirements. HELD: The plaintiff's claim can proceed to trial. The Court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was 'beyond the authority of this Court.' This was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. It was also clear that the plaintiff had no legal right to bring the claim. The court struck out the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendant's property onto the plaintiff's property.

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of pickled whole herring. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services was upheld. 1) The Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. It was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process.  2) The Court of Appeal reviewed the history of the legislation and particularly s. 10(1)(h)(i) and (j) and noted that the exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are produced for sale."

As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT: The Crown applies to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the police and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. When a witness recants, the requirement of necessity and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. HELD: 1)The Crown has satisfied the requirements for substantive use of the statement set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C. (3d) 145. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate any one, but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the jury is not prepared to say that ipso facto the balance of the statements is unreliable. 2)The reliability threshold can be met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. 3)The credibility of the witness's prior statement may be introduced for the substantive truth of its subject matter."

Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a doorman and relief bartender. During the course of the evening there were two minor incidents and exchanges between Baikie, his associates, and the accused, neither of which progressed beyond the verbal stage. The accused punched the complainant over the shoulder and knocked him down. The complainant then punched the accused on the back of the head and face. He was not drinking on the occasion. The Crown witnesses testified that the accused was in a 'inebriated state' and took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating to' to him. HELD: The accused was guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The facts were as stated by the Crown witnesses, with the qualification the accused did indeed attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by the accused. He may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so, but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In his state, he was no threat to the accused and that the 'accused in fact took advantage' of the position to administer several blows to him, either at the beginning of the altercation or at the conclusion of the argument. The evidence was consistent with the accused committing the assault and that he did not commit any other act of self-defence. The Court accepted the accused's defence that he threw the punch but did not accept the defence's argument that he was the one who set the stage for the assault."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, receiving order ought not to have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt submitted that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) An order annulling his assignment was not a dangerous precedent. 2) An annulment of the assignment would result in the creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain builders' liens claimants have already commenced an action. 3) The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthlyfinancial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. 4) The application by the bankrupt for an order to annull his assignment is dismissed. 5) Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application. The bankrupt states that he was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not effect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home. The trustee maintains that the bankrupt received wrong legal advice concerning the effects of a assignment on 'automatic discharge'. He states he 'thought' he was advised that the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself.  6) On those two grounds the bankrupt also asserts that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses.","The parties sought interim custody of their son, who was born October 10, 1997. HELD: Interim custody and primary residence were given to the respondent. The respondent was to have access for the duration of the interim custody order. Access was to be provided for the first year of the child's life and the second year of his life. Child care costs were to be maintained in the respondent's primary residence until the court ordered interim custody.

e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant argued that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid. The plaintiff argued that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it would be obligated to share the proceeds in any sales made by the defendants. The defendants argued that it was the intent of the parties to have the dairy operation continue as family farm in order to continue the tradition established by their parents. HELD: The court found that the defendant was in a conflict position. The agreement only refers to the Fluid milk Quota. It was not the agreement that the brothers and their father had agreed upon. In fact, the agreement was so vague that it became clear that it would not trigger an obligation to share. The court also found that there was a possible conflict of interest between the parties because the defendant and the plaintiff had agreed that Fluid was to be sold separately from the other farm assets and that the value of the farm on going concern basis was about $400,000 less than if the assets were retained."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","HELD: The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement and whether liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The central issue was not the lease but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and a secured party. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value of the paint. The Agreement falls within the ambit of s.55 of the Act and the right is restricted to repossession and sale by s. 46(2). The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that the consent by Mr. Poirier to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. However, consideration of this issue is only necessary in the event that the agreement is lease, and if have correctly interpreted the Agreement to be a conditional sales contract, Case Credit's claim is barred by The Act. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Farm."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' (as they both described the relationship in their respective affidavits) for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. HELD: Appeal allowed; s. 15(1) declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect; declaration suspended for twelve months per reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Roscoe, JA. concurring. 1) The essence of being unmarried of not having contracted marriage in the manner recognized by the state in the sense of the federal Divorce Act of 1968 was not an analogous ground upon which to base a claim of discrimination on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. 2) The definition of a common law spouse is a presumption only, in that the Act also allows judges to make an unequal division in some cases. The right to spousal support arises only at the end of marriage. The individual exercises limited but not exclusive control over the designation. The only exceptions to this are the right to equal possession of the matrimonial home and to veto any sale or mortgage of it. These rights arise at the moment of marriage and continue during the marriage. It is only when death, separation or divorce intervenes that questions of title become important. However, the reality may be otherwise. This is even more so where the traditional relationship was in all ways a traditional and fairly long term relationship. In this context, the intermarriage between the appellant and the respondent is analogous to that which occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. It touches the essential dignity and worth of the individual in the same way as other recognized grounds of discrimination violative of fundamental human rights norms. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, had been revealed as inadequate at both practical and psychological level. Practically speaking, the prevalence of the male-provider/female-dependent model in the postwar period meant that the assumption of an equal opportunity to earn income was meaningless. The separate property model also seemed to be based on a"
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused was charged with second degree murder. The Crown tendered a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents of choking. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge must not invade the province of trier of fact and condition admissibility on hearsay as it may distract members of the jury from their proper focus. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) There is a serious potential for moral prejudice by admitting the same fact evidence as it is presumed to be inadmissible. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice if other hearsay from the same witness with the same content has already been admitted, then the hearsay may not be necessary. 2) The Court found there must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. However, there was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the harm was likely to cause death or was reckless whether death ensued."

The sentencing judge failed to comply with the explicit provisions of s. 737(1) and (6) of the Code. The sentence was varied to include an order requiring the Respondent to pay a $30 surcharge in the amount of $30. The respondent was sentenced to a fine of $200 and placed on probation for 1 year. Among other things, the probation terms require Mr. Yaremko to partake in anger management programming. As he concluded the sentencing, and without any discussion or explanation, the sentencing judge waived the Victim surcharge. The court appealed. HELD: 1) The sentence is varied to reflect an order that the respondent must pay a victim sur charge in $30 to be paid. The Crown must give reasons for the reduction in the surcharge and provide reasons for why it has varied the sentence.  2) It is mandatory subject only to an application under s 737(5) relating to undue hardship.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause in the Union's by-laws. The union resists the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the by-law and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association. Exhausting internal remedies The plaintiff sought guidance from the Court of Appeal in McNairn v. United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry. Rule 485(1) provides that a party may apply with supporting affidavit material either by notice of motion for summary judgment, or application for summary trial. The Court must not lend its process to the Fourth Action as the plaintiff has available to him further internal Union appeals. The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual in nature, and is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the union's By-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making final appeal."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The court also held that the respondent had jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issue was when the respondent received effective notice of the applicant's application for variation of child support. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. There was no arbitrary cut-off point based either on age or scholastic attainment although as a general rule, parents of bona fide student will remain responsible until the child has reached level of education, commensurate with the abilities he or she has demonstrated, which fit the child for entry level employment in an appropriate field."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal.

The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not reach this conclusion on the basis of the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to misapprehend the importance, generally, of a sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties. Nor was the Committee convinced the Assessor had erred in relation to the determination of the fair value of the building. 2) To begin with, the committee did not misconstrue the importance of the Sale Verification Information (SVA) and its information it yielded. To the extent the Committee erred, it misinterpreted and misapplied law in upholding the Board's decision that the sale of the Southland Mall qualified for inclusion in an appropriate MAF. 3) It failed to give effect to the fact that Cadillac Fairview and Ontrea used an unrealistic capitalization rate in allocating $19,000,000 of the portfolio sale price to the mall. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property, did not include any atypical financing terms and conditions, and did not substitute for the sale price the vendor and purchaser had allocated to the purchase of the interest in each of the three shopping malls. It was satisfied no adjustment was required. 4) There was no material error on the part of the Committee."

The court reviewed the jurisprudence from other Canadian jurisdictions which do not have restrictive rule s. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act and found that a cross examination may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in ss6 and 6(1) to the certification application. It is important to the court that the defendant be held accountable.
e_2010skqb464.txt,"The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials. The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and an order that the plaintiff is entitled to a lien under the Builders' Lien Act. HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The procedure at trial would be the procedure for simplified trial as set out in Maisonneuve, supra, Dawson J. states at para. 41 Whether one considers damages for breach of contract or damages in tort, the damages will usually be the reasonable costs of remedying the defects. However, an owner is entitled only to have such defects remedied to such extent as to conform to the requirement of the contract, but not to require additional work or to have work done of higher quality than the work expected to be performed by the owner."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania seeks the respondent's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Romania's submissions as to the deficiencies in the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the respondent are compelling and the risk of non-appearance is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court, he might be able to meet.  2) The respondent's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement displace the limiting effect of its legal obligations under international extradition treaties on level of acceptable risk under the s.679(3)(b) test; or, as he more bluntly put it, when it comes to the assessment of a flight-risk.  3) The court found that the respondent had not met the low threshold on which it must limit the assumption of a risk of his non- reappearance in extradition proceedings.  4) There was no reason to consider the third test under s.623(b)(c).  5) The Court found that it would be 'non-sensical' for the respondent to flee prior to the Minister's decision on surrender as this would, obviously, not stand in his favour.  6) The applicant's ties to the community and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations in this case.  7) Romania’s submissions are well-made in that these facts do serve to elevate the risk.  8) The Crown concedes that the appellant has met this low threshold. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application for extradition."
e_2017skqb265.txt,"The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code. During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of three young flag people. The accused had been driving a semi-trailer at the time of the collision and had been injured in the rear when the truck struck the flag person standing near their vehicle. The flag person had been working as a flag person for the past two years and had just finished driving a group of southbound vehicles through a construction zone when he was struck by the semi-truck driven by the accused. The Crown argued that the accused's unlawful conduct was a result of his lack of sleep and mental health awareness. The defence argued that this was an important factor in his decision to operate the motor vehicle. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to 6 years in federal prison. The Court found that the offences were serious and that the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case were sufficient to warrant a sentence of 6 years plus 1 day in federal institution. The offences were found to be dangerous driving. The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant had ever travelled on Highway No. in the Province of Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and, in particular, had ever driven through the construction zone."
