The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. HELD: An order requiring the bankrupt to pay monthly installments of $500 for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income, he would be remiss if did not offer the court's assistance to educate the bankrupt relating to this obligation.","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to ss.87 and 251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and directing the Registrar of Land Title to issue a new title in their joint names with the right of survivorship. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not in my opinion a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. The title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.  2)The court found that the authorities had narrowly construed the discretion to amend or alter or cancel registrations under The Land Titling Act. The courts must be mindful of the integrity of the Torrens Land Tits System. There must be an obvious mistake which requires rectification.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other."
2,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,The deceased's will was executed in 1997. The deceased's wife had died shortly after receiving her doctorate in medicine from the American College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was the mother of the deceased's three children. The surviving surviving children were his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. HELD: The deceased was found to be the father of the children. He was the sole beneficiary of the estate. The court ordered a single hearing of all issues so that it could avoid repetition of viva voce testimony and duplication of effort.,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance."
3,Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. An appeal to this Court lies on any question relating to the Board's jurisdiction or upon any question of law; s.30(1) of the Utility & Review Board Act, 1992. The Director did not deny that the clerk of the municipality received a copy of the notice of appeal within 30 days from the decision of a Regional Assessment Appeal Court. He took the position that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk. The appeal was dismissed with costs to each respondent in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal."

The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial. HELD: 1) The defendant is entitled to 7 months notice of termination.  2) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The plaintiff's counsel put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months. Taking all factors into account, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."
5,Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats cheering loudly. He never saw the accused approach him. He hit the wall behind him and fell to the concrete floor. The victim was run over and killed by a truck. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty as charged. 1)While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The assault itself might not fall within the confines of Section 267(2) in that being semi-conscious or unconscious, they are closely related in time and otherwise. 2)The Court held that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that the harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 3)Given the circumstances, the Court found that the accused driving was a contributing cause of the bodily injury and not just a'minimal' or 'insignificant' cause. 4)The court held that the jury must conclude that the offence was a contributing cause of an accident. The Court held the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 20 of the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice, or of being too vague. 5)The accused's reaction to the Brown's cheering 'kill him, kill #57' while his son was down on the ice, provocation not being a defence, was more than an insignificant or trivial cause.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm."
6,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. Accordingly, the appellant is essentially asking this court to set aside the judge’ s credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the trial Judge, and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages."

The prothonor opposed the application arguing that the affidavits were inadmissible and that the cross-examination could not be used to determine the merits of the application. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the court found that the court erred in striking the appellant's affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant. The court found the affidavit to be inadmissible and that it did not meet the requirements for an interlocutory recovery order.,"Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order. Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue. Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out."
8,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of a friend of hers. She had no criminal record but was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence on the grounds that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect for deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. The accused appealed. Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was a drug dealer and had a previous criminal record. She did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and she seems to be doing well in all programs in prison. 2)The sentence of the accused was increased by this Court to the equivalent of more than ten years imprisonment on the basis that she had no previous convictions. The Court noted that the accused had a criminal record and had been involved in the beating of the two men. The court noted that 1)the accused had no prior convictions. She was not a party to any of the assaults. She appeared to have had a positive impact on the victims' lives. She appealed the sentence of 2½ year imprisonment. 3)The Crown appealed. The sentencing of the victim was increased to 5 years. The judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate. The victim had no record and was doing well. 4)The Court noted the accused's previous convictions, which had not governed her sentence.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."

The applicant also sought an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the respondent from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any potassium sulfate produced at its plant. HELD: 1) The applicant was granted injunty against the respondent. 2) The respondent had no written client list or other written information about the process used by the applicant. 3) The plaintiff had no business relationship with the defendant. 4) The defendant was not the only source for such information. The defendant had no contractual or other relationship with either of the parties. 5) Although the defendant had a technical knowledge of the material used in marketing the product, it did not have a marketing experience. 6) The court found that the plaintiff had not obtained sufficient assurances that the technology used in the product was efficient enough for its purposes. The court ordered further injunctions.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."

The defendant's claim is that Mr. MacLean's dog ran onto the Conrod Settlement Road in front of the plaintiffts motor vehicle forcing the vehicle into the ditch with resultant damage and that the accident was caused by the plaintiff's negligence in failing to keep his dog under control.

The court found that the defendant had not given any reasons for not filing a defence in this proceeding other than his assertion that the originating notice was not served on him. He did not recall the circumstances of the particular service.","The respondent entered a default judgment against the applicant and issued an Execution Order.

11,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She was driving her vehicle at a high rate of speed when she tripped over a line and collided with another vehicle. The other vehicle veered into the opposite lane and struck the appellant's vehicle. Both occupants of the vehicle were injured. The appellant was found to be intoxicated. The trial judge refused to grant a stay of all charges on the grounds that the appellant’s right to retain and instruct counsel without delay had been violated. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant”s memory of the accident was not impaired by alcohol. 2) There was nothing unusual about the appellant as she was alone in the vehicle. 3) The evidence was that of a member of the RCMP who was in the area where the accident occurred. The RCMP officer who was driving the vehicle at the time did not see the appellant in the first place. The officer who had been driving the car at high speed did not have any recollection of what had happened. 4) The officer testified that he did not observe the appellant drive over the line in front of the other vehicle. He did not notice anything unusual about her. 5) The RCMP Officer testified that the officer did not detect any odour of alcohol during the time that he was with the appellant. He testified that there was nothing suspicious about the driver of the second vehicle.,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal."
12,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation at hand and that the return of the respondent's employee from maternity leave did not result in an indefinite reduction of hours within the department. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the arbitrator's decision was patently unreasonable. The court cannot intervene simply because it disagrees with the reasoning of the arbitration board or because it would have reached different conclusions.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The respondent had been aware of the allegations and was aware that the Province had been delegated the powers granted to and duties vested in the Minister of Justice to the Department of Justice. The delegation of the duty of the head of public body (in this case the Minister) to the Attorney General created an anomalous situation. 2)The applicant had been advised that the Department had delegated certain powers to the Minister and that they were to be exercised by the respondent. 3)The appellant had not been given the opportunity to participate in the ADR process. The respondent had not received the information requested.,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record."

The Provincial Court judge, after trial, had acquitted him of a charge under s.253(b) on the grounds that his ability to concentrate and his judgment were unaffected. However, the appellate court judge made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge thereon. The acquittal because of a reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it a finding by the trial that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.08 at the time of driving. It is inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench judge on those facts, which are his sole province, to say that the respondent did not see any indicia of impairment.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).

He shall report to the court whenever required to do so by the court. 2)The Court was satisfied in all of the circumstances that the continued detention of the accused cannot be justified under the law as laid down by Parliament in s. 515(10). Generally bail is denied only for those who 'pose a substantial likelihood of committing an offence or interfering with the Administration of justice' (R. v. Morales). 3)The court was not satisfied that the detention of accused was necessary for the protection or safety of the public.

The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified. Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds. His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public.

The police officer was not aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example, a hard night of drinking the night before and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle, and he did not provide adequate supply of air in the breathalyser. When the officer asked him if he wanted to call his lawyer, the accused indicated that he did. The second officer asked the accused if he could blow into an Intoxilyzer and he said he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. The third officer asked if he had any other advice and when the accused said he did, he blew long and hard on the Intoxalyzer and nothing registered on it. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The officer's hastiness does not change the fact that the accused's right to counsel was violated. The onus is on the accused person to satisfy the trial judge that he has a reasonable excuse. 2) The admission of the evidence obtained would not bring the administration of justice into a situation where the accused is not being reasonably diligent in the exercise of his rights. 3) The accused's behaviour was misleading in that it was impossible for the officer to satisfy him that he should waive his right to seek medical attention. 4) The police were not given a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel of his choice as was his right under s. 10(b) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed.

The respondent was the owner of the vehicle under a vehicle registration certificate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made Ms. Clayton aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11/2001 to November 14/2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The applicant sought to defeat this security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner of it, had made the payments and was always in possession of it. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. In the special circumstances of this matter, the Court declined to order costs of either motion.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion."

HELD: 1) The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child. He did not make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift.  2) Clause 11 of the Will does not describe a contrary intention. In that clause, J.D. underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. The words should be given the meaning that was intended by him. 3) The gift is to those of the class only who survive him. 4) The Court must ascertain the ordinary meaning of the words used in light of the surrounding circumstances. 5) The distinction is founded on the law of lapse. In the former case there is a gift to all his children, naming them and some of them die in his lifetime, leaving children who survive the testators' lifetime to take their share of the inheritance. 6) The court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of the judge.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."

The only question remaining was whether the court had the jurisdiction to apply the law of the last common habitual residence of the parties.  1)Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, the respondent was entitled to the same relief the English court accorded to the plaintiff. She did so on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered the agreement.

At trial, the Crown brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analyses, such evidence flowing from an approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. HELD: The accused was acquitted of impaired driving. 1)There was no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count. The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the body. 2)The accused admitted to having her last drink approximately one hour before being stopped. In cross-examination it was clear that the threshold was far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of the section, however, was clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist."

Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends.

She had access to the child by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of the child in an unsupervised situation. The paternal grandmother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. HELD: The child was placed in the permanent care and custody of the maternal grandmother and that the matter be dismissed pursuant to s. 42(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. The court found that the mother was able to provide for the child's needs and that she relied on the agency plan. The child would be joined as a party to the proceeding started by the maternal grandparent under the Maintenance and Custody Act.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them."

The plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for some 9 years. 2)Limitation of Actions Act s.3 requires that the action must be commenced within 6 years after any such action arises. 3)This is a contractual matter which, under S.1(e) of the Limitation of Action Act, requires that a lease be executed within six years after it was first executed. 4)The plaintiff's diligence is consistent with s.2(2) of The Limitation Act.

After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

They entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001 and entered into divorce in 2003. The parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the divorce proceeding. In 2003, the petitioner petitioned for divorce on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had not been able to obtain the mortgage they needed to purchase their perspective home. HELD: The Divorce Judgment was granted on the basis that the petitioner was entitled to spousal support retroactively to the date the husband ceased paying the $1,000 per month. The petitioner's application for a stay of the support was dismissed. The court found the petitioner's financial needs did not require such support.","The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.

The respondent had completed grade 12 at Millwood High School and was attending university. She had been a dependent child for some time prior to the accident. The appellant had not withdrawn from the charge of his parents and was now pursuing post-secondary studies. He had made great strides but was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident and was taking a hiatus before continuing his education. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The judge clearly understood that the child may wish to work in order to save for the cost of post-primary education but was not intending to continue his education; the respondent's future ability to 'withdraw from parental charge' was unknown. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. The court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the respondent had not withdraw and was not entitled to withdraw.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."

He testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says his conviction is miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The judge's misapprehendion of evidence was substantial. She ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found inconsistency between the appellant's evidence that he spent three or four hours a day in the children's home and his evidence that the judge asked him never to be left alone with them because he was afraid of being charged with sexual abuse. 3) The evidence bearing on the appellant’s credibility was highly material to that evidence. The appellant”s evidence about being 'good to the children' did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages."

The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."

HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act."

The defendant denied that the transaction was a loan to the plaintiff and her husband, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiffs into the auto broking business. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence that the plaintiff loaned money to the defendant or his company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd. 2)The defendant denied any loan to either of the defendants. 3)The plaintiff did not have a business record. She was not a registered business name of the defendant. She did not own the business. 4)The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was actually a loan was the affidavit filed by the plaintiff in cross-examination. The affidavit did not state that the defendant had a business name. The plaintiff was not the sole beneficiary of the money.","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant."
36,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The Crown appealed a Provincial Court decision quashing a search warrant issued against the respondent. The Crown argued that the judge erred in applying the standard of review upon which he was to review the decision to issue the warrant. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge had erred by failing to place appropriate weight upon the evidence gathered by the confidential informant when determining whether the search warrant was valid. The evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The Court also found that there was no breach of s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."

The husband applied to have his name taken off the mortgage on the home and to be paid spousal support. The wife argued that she was entitled to the spousals of $800 per month and that she would not be able to pay spousa for the remaining month. She also sought an order to have the husband's name off the property and to have it divided equally between the parties. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for rehearing on an expedited basis. 1) The court found no reason why the matter could not be heard again. The facts and history of the case were obviously well known to the court. 2) The fair division of property between the husband and wife should only be decided upon a proper record, with all assets considered and when both parties have been given the opportunity to present their evidence. This should not be done by a judge who has no authority to do something which really doesn't have authority to be done. 3) Findings of credibility were entirely within his province and do not require any comment from this Court.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value."

The defendant was operating a police vehicle at the time of the accident when the plaintiffs' vehicle was struck by another vehicle. The plaintiff was injured in the accident. She testified that she turned on her headlights when she saw the police vehicle approaching the intersection. She said she did not see the vehicle in front of her. She claimed the lights were not in operation when the accident occurred. The plaintiffs claim the headlights of the defendant's vehicle were not operating when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff is contributory negligent. HELD: The plaintiff is found to be contributory to the accident and the plaintiffs are awarded damages of $8,500.00.  1) The evidence of the plaintiff's headlights was not advanced to the conclusion that the lamps were not functioning. The evidence was not presented to the court. 2) There was no evidence that the defendant had any prior knowledge of the lights in operation prior to impact. The court was not able to determine how close the plaintiff came to the vehicle or the extent of attention she paid to it. There was insufficient evidence to establish that the defendants were negligent in failing to observe the vehicle when it was struck. The Court was not satisfied that the evidence was advanced to a conclusion that either the plaintiff’s headlights were on or that the plaintiffs had not been properly trained in the area. It could be described as an erroneous act or even negligent act but accept that the Court was unable to establish the plaintiff was not qualified to express his opinion.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."

The application alleged that the applicant filed fraudulent T4 and created a false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been the basis for the search warrant. The applicant claimed the judge should have recused himself from considering the application to issue a search on the basis of an apprehension of bias. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant's own evidence supported the inference that he would not have pursued a search without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. 2)The application for a search was dismissed on the grounds that the paragraphs were too vague and irrelevant to raise an issue of bias and depriving the applicant of natural justice. 3)The issues were whether there was a reasonable apprehension of prejudice or reasonable apprehension. The facts did not support reasonable apprehension as to bias. The applications for leave to appeal were dismissed.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."
40,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The parties were married for 17 years. They separated in 2004. The parties had four children. The oldest child resided with his mother when she was attending university. The youngest child lived with his father when he was working part-time. The mother was the primary caregiver and the father provided the primary care. The father was employed with the federal government and drove a cab on a part time basis. The wife worked part time as a social worker. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. The husband was employed as a taxi driver. The petitioner lived in her apartment. She worked part- time at daycare. She was also the primary child carer. The court found that the children's responses were not in any way influenced by the proximity of their mother. Divorce judgment was issued. The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the children to be placed in the custody and primary care of the mother.,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors."
41,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The Defence position was that he should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court found the accused to be a dangerous and long- term offender. 1)The Court reviewed the relevant law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which made it clear that the accused might be found to be dangerous. The Court reviewed R. v. R.H.L., which dealt with the issue of whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender is a dangerous or long-time offender. 2)The accused was found to have a history of alcohol and drug abuse. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, with normal parole eligibility, plus a term of community supervision of up to ten years, which term can be reduced in certain circumstances. The result of the 1997 amendments, which did not change the criteria for finding the accused a dangerous, was that some offenders who would previously have been found not be dangerous offenders may now be found, therefore it upheld the dangerous offender designation. 3)There was an overlap in the dates of the offences. The accused had been convicted of two aggravated assaults and one predicate offence. He had been sentenced to 11 months secure custody plus probation for 2 years. The court reviewed the circumstances of the first two convictions and found that the Court was left with a distinct risk of being dismissed. 4)The court reviewed whether there had been a reasonable possibility of control of the risk of harm in the community under the current Criminal Code provisions.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."

HELD: The Court found that the father was the primary caregiver for the child and that the mother's role in the child's life was to be shared with the mother. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the petitioner had ever visited the mother in Nova Scotia. The court ordered that the child be taken care of by the mother, who resided in the city with her father. The child was to spend the next four years in the mother’s care.","Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access."

Application dismissed; the plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages. The court found that the plaintiffs had not shown sufficient competency to defend themselves against the allegations of negligence or breach of duty. The plaintiffs were entitled to responses to questions and inquiries in relation to the plaintiff's care both before and after her discharge from the hospital.,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."
44,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was found in the driver's seat of an idling vehicle. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the passenger's seat. He did not intend to drive the vehicle. The Crown had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the time in question.,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."

The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. The court found that the test of necessity has been met. The evidence supports the inference that the statements made by the complainant are admissible because certain aspects of that statement were independently verified. The Court found that there were sufficient indicia of reliability in any particular case to substitute for the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."

The issues were whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing and whether the landlord could refuse to grant an order for possession when there was an outstanding order. HELD: The matter was remitted for rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The Landlord must prove that it would be just and equitable to grant a writ for possession. 2) There was nothing in the decision that would permit the Rentals to refuse to issue a writ. 3) The Court was not satisfied that the Notice to Terminate was properly served. 4) The issues in this case were whether the Land's assertion that it did not have notice of this hearing was ever considered by the Rentalman. The Rentals were in a position to address these issues on the hearing of the appeal.","This is an appeal by the landlord pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman who, pursuant to s. 47 of the Act dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession. HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman. The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants."

The issue before the court was whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children. HELD: 1) What, if any, interim spousal support should be payable by the father to the Mother.  2) What is the father's share of both childcare costs and Sylvan Learning Centre costs?  3) What if any retroactive support was ordered in this matter? 4) What are the costs of Sylvan learning centre expenses? 5) What percentage of the cost should the father contribute to the tutoring program? 6) The father's proportionate share of the Sylvan costs would be an amount equal to 71% of the total cost.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."

The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the accused to speak. The recording was not conscriptive evidence in the sense described in Stillman. 2) The accused was denied his right to choose his audience. The fact that the police believed they were pursuing an offence under s. 271(1) did not mean that what he said to the complainant was compelled. The evidence ought to be considered to be non-conscriptive. 3) The Court found that the evidence was irrelevant because it was obtained without an authorization. 4) There was no Charter breach and the evidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded. 5) Even if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of manipulation. 6) The seriousness of the breach was minimal and would not affect the administration of justice.","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The amendments were permitted by Queen's B Bench Rule 66 and leave of the court under s.20 of the LIMitations Act was not required. The application was dismissed. The Limitations Amendment Act does not apply to claims of negligence against Saskatchewan, but rather to those arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. The only issues raised by the plaintiffs' application were whether the amendments should be allowed to proceed, if so, and whether the plaintiffs should be required to apply for leave to add Saskatchewan to an existing action.","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court."
50,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator asks that a hearing be ordered to prove his last will and testament in solemn form, for the purpose of determining whether the will was brought about by the exertion of undue influence by the testator. HELD: 1) There is a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089, which says that if a will is prepared in circumstances raising justifiable suspicion that it does not reflect the mind and wish of a testator, then it is for those who propound the will to overcome the suspicion. This is not to say the propounder need prove negative that the testatory was not induced by undue influence to sign the will but the propounding principle is not shifted by suspicion but the court must scrutinize the evidence closely in light of the suspicion to determine whether undue influence ought to be drawn. 2) All the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial of the foregoing issues including the Rules pertaining to disclosure, production of documents, examinations for discovery and pretrial conference. 3) The testator was to bear the burden of establishing the deceased's knowledge and approval of the contents of the will. The applicant shall bear the liability for the alleged undue influence. 4) The question to be tried is whether the testators at the time of execution of the Will was subjected to undue influence, based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law. It is not necessary to have viva voce evidence on this application.","The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator. HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered."

On the same day that the permanent guardianship orders were granted, the respondent became the guardians of the child not in the permanent care of an agency (subject to limited exceptions). HELD: The appeal was allowed and the adoption application was remitted to a judge of the Family Division. The respondent mother's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing was reasonably capable of belief; the steps she took to engage counsel were reasonable in the circumstances and that she acted with dispatch. The court would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the appellant's affidavit and affidavit. It would be appropriate that consider whether such a result would be in the best interests of the children.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing."

The respondent had been employed by the respondent for thirty-one years and contributed to a pension plan valued at $283,237.00. In May 2007, the respondent applied for Grant of Administration. The applicant failed to respond to the notice on the original scheduled date for hearing. She therefore necessitated a second date. The parties were to each bear their respective costs. Order accordingly. The Application must fail. It is clear that the removal of the respondent's personal representative is not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' if the intended lawsuit with Marine Atlantic were feasible. It would only be so if the intention lawsuit with the respondent were feasible, but not if the proposed lawsuit with a Marine Atlantic was feasible.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement."

The child had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. The Minister appealed the order, arguing that, while the judge on appeal had jurisdiction to make an order subject to conditions (see s. 63(4)(c) and 37(5)(a)), this power was not broad enough to permit the judge to make such an order that both returns the child to the custody of the parent and has the child remain in the Minister's care for a temporary period, pursuant to S37(1)(b). HELD: Leave was granted or withheld on considerations of merit and importance. The issue was of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal. The court was satisfied that the issue is of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the court, or to the field of practice or the state of the law, to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

54,Issue | Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director that effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to a month lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the tenant's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord effectively refused to renew for another year. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy had not been converted into a monthly to month lease because the tenant refused to give his reasons for withholding consent. The practical effect of either possible result could work hardship on either party. The court found that the reasons for the refusal to give consent were either arbitrary or unreasonable. The Court allowed the appeal and declared that the lease had been not converted to a monthly. The tenant had the advantage of the landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination and the ability to sublet, if and when he determines that he wants to leave early. In effect, the risk of vacancy falls on the tenant and not the landlord.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."

HELD: 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. 2) The father had been on the methadone program for some time and had been apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requested a six-month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The father was to continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attended to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposed to address his own addiction problems. 3) The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles, and failures to comply with dispositions made with regard to his offences. The evidence also showed that he had a relationship with the Ministry and that the Ministry had a positive screen for opiates and marijuana in the form of a drug screen. The mother indicated that she had never been to the Ministry for any of the parenting classes and that she was concerned about the father's failure to follow through with the parenting services and noncompliance with the PSA's. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the evidence showed the father was not doing well with the program and that he did not have a good working relationship with his children.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them."

The plaintiffs applied for certification. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased the Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The plaintiff sought to have the order for pre- certification served on the plaintiff. Red Seal denied the application. The motion was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff could not rely on s. 14 or s. 24 of the Act to make the pre certification order. The Court found that Red Seal had not shown that it had a conflict of interest and therefore could not proceed with the certification application. It ordered the plaintiff to produce a list of potential class members.,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction."

The respondent argued that the IRBs for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRb calculated for the first 180 days after the accident. HELD: The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. 1) The IRB is calculated on a formula of gross yearly employment income (GEOI) less deductions under the provincial and federal income tax acts, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada), and contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (Canada). 2) Section 198 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of the claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. Because Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality."

Adshead 2004 SKQB 536. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The respondent had made no effort to become self sufficient. The evidence did not establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the court. The court valued the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge."

The petitioner seeks that the parenting judgment be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last parenting order was made. The respondent has provided generous access to the petitioner since the birth of the twins. 2) The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him in this regard and the application should be dismissed.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs."

The landlord also appealed the decision of the hearing officer. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) It is open to the Hearing officer to accept some of the evidence of a particular witness and not other evidence of that witness. The Hearing Officer is not bound to accept all of the information told to her by the witness. 2) The grounds set out in the landlord's appeal relate to the findings of fact made by the Hearing Office. The tenant's appeal relates to the hearing Officer's finding of facts related to her claim for reimbursement of one-half of the utilities. 3) The landlord asserts that the Court was wrong in its decision on the facts. In essence, the landlord asserts the Hearing Hearing Officer did not find the facts as he suggested that he should have. It is also open to that Hearing Officer to accept other evidence if agreed upon.","The applicant landlord appeals from a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office, which ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $787.13.

Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant submits the young persons were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm done to them. HELD: The application was granted. The sealing order was at the top of the hierarchy of protections which the court may afford individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the two young people and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The positive effects of such disclosure would be on the children and their family at a further risk.","The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others."

The court reviewed the matter and found that the purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court was obvious. Nor was this a new or novel proceeding under the Queen’s Bench Rules. The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial was found in Rule 184B of the Queen.,"Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439. The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith."

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence of common assault. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty in this case. The determination of credibility does not involve the Court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the Court must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the accused in that respect.",The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.

The accused was detained for 11 minutes and a breath sample was obtained. The officer placed the accused in the police vehicle because he was investigating a possible drunk driving charge. He indicated he did not have a lawyer and asked when he would like to speak with another lawyer. The police officer indicated that he was unaware of how long he had waited in his vehicle and asked if he wanted to speak to another lawyer, which the accused replied that he did. He was then detained 11 minutes after the officer placed him in the patrol vehicle and a sample of his breath was obtained for him. The Court found the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. HELD: 1) The Court held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his Charter rights.  2) The delay was of a relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel. 3) The accused submits his rights under s. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. 4) The Certificate was not excluded.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The Crown appealed his acquittal on the basis that the trial judge erred in misapprehension of the evidence and misapplied the evidence. HELD: The Crown appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was required to address s.2 of the Criminal Code with respect to the definition of a weapon. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as such. The categories of lay opinion evidence, as with the opinion evidence of experts, are not closed. The weight of evidence is for the trier of fact. 2)The Crown argued that the weapon should have been found by trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. However, the Crown suggested that the Crown required special qualifications that would justify his opinion; that the blade was a decorative copy of the sword and that it likely came from a novelty store. The trial judge concluded that she had a reasonable doubt the sword could be used for a weapon and acquitted the accused of the charge.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed."

The Court found that the appellant had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with a weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation. She was remanded to the Nova Scotia Forensic Hospital for disposition and was granted an absolute discharge with respect to this charge. The respondents' motion to have the appellant pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the Court was granted.

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay.

Had signed a non-compete agreement in 1995. The opening of the new business was imminent. The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. HELD: The Interlocutory Injunction was granted. 1)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the Plaintiff company - the loss of customers, or market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test. 2)The applicant was facing a serious threat to its business and it had reasonable argument that this Court should examine the situation and perhaps intervene.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent."

The respondent had been convicted of four charges of sexual assault and was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime S. 490/012(2). Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. Nothing in this Code suggests a lifetime duration on the part of the judge who interpreted s.485.013 as not applying in circumstances where a sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designated offence' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a 'designation' offence.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).

The trial judge found that the appellant had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of his breath, and the appellant's claim for breach of the Charter was dismissed. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the evidence in totality. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and reasonable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 2) The officer's evidence showed that she was not certain if the appellant was operating his motor vehicle when his ability to do so was impaired. 3) The court found the appellant could not have had reasonable grounds for demand for a breath sample as only minutes before she was uncertain as to whether she did have reasonable or probable grounds. The subjective element in determining whether a person has reasonable and possible grounds to make a demand is not present.","The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts.

The respondents sought to have the judgment set aside pending the disposition of the appeal. The court found that the respondent's application was premature and that it would not appear to be functus officio. The Court of Appeal would have jurisdiction to order a stay of all further proceedings in the action pending the determination of the final judgment.,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.

He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The judge was not bound to accept the experts' assessment of his risk. He gave more than adequate reasons for questioning the foundation the assessments were based upon. The trial judge rejected the argument that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community. The court dismissed the appeal.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal."

The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. The plaintiff appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. 2)The plaintiff was forced to return to her previous position as a fully-tenured faculty member at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The union had worked to ensure that the plaintiff was able to return and that her complaints were entirely unfounded and without substance. 3)There was no basis for concluding that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in finding the plaintiff had in fact been defamed by the publication of the allegations against him. 4)The court found that the court erred in finding that the words in the grievance were not defamed but that they were published in a manner that was not arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith. 5)The Court found that it did not err by finding that there was qualified privilege in the statements made by the plaintiff. The court would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249).","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."

The parties were disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each had made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in failing to require the Federal Representative to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. The applicant failed to establish there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or the field of practice or the state of law, to warrant a determination by the Court of Appeal. The appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court."

The defendant was also entitled to costs. The Court was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the $5,000.00 cheque was a loan as there was no record of it being paid back to the plaintiff. The court found that there were errors in the defendant's testimony as to the amount of money paid back. The plaintiff was entitled in part to the $1,000 cheque. The defendants were the only parties to the claim. The $5k.00 was never paid back as the defendant had the free use of the plaintiff's home and the defendant car whenever they needed it. There was no evidence to support the claim that the payments were not consented to and agreed to by the defendant. The Defendant was awarded $32.32 for the $2,400.00. The balance was therefore not satisfied. The payments were never made to the defendant, as the plaintiff was on salary.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance."
76,Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine. The accused was bound by a youth probation order based on a conviction of possession for the use of cocaine. One of the terms of that probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had the permission of the Court. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Court also placed the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."
77,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,The defendants applied for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendants. The defendants applied to stay the proceedings pending the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the application for certification of the BC Action. Application dismissed; cross-examination of affidavits submitted by the defendants in support of the defendants' application for carriage of the proceedings was not permitted.,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."
78,Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC Document : ,"FIAT: The plaintiff, CN, applied to the Court of Appeal seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc., answer certain questions they refused to answer on discovery. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff of $1,500.00. The court found that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so, and any implied waiver could be restricted to material relating to the formulation of the expressed opinion. The Court found that when an expert takes the stand or the expert's report is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver of information in the expert’s file which is foundational to the opinion.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers."
79,Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT. The parties were married in 2008 and separated in April 2011. The mother wanted to change her residence and that of their two young children. The father was in custody for the duration of his incarceration. He opposed the move. HELD: 1) The mother had unilaterally moved with the children from Nokomis to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. When the father was released from custody, the mother made an application to allow the move and that issue was adjourned pending the receipt of the custody/access report. The court found that the mother had always been the primary caregiver to the children and that it was reasonable to have matters resolved in the father's favour. While the father has been in custody since September 2012, she has not been seen by him for the past nine months. There is nothing suggesting the children have anything other than a close and loving relationship with the mother. The access for the next ten months will be very limited. While there has been a material change of circumstances affecting the children, their mother's reasons for moving were largely self-evident. There was no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. 2) The children had access with their father every three weeks until he was released. There had not been a change in the children's lives. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnancy meant a new sibling would be introduced into their lives. 3) The father had not shown any evidence that the children would be disrupted by the move, even if he were in custody. The children would not be disrupted in terms of their frequency of contact with the father, or with any increased difficulties in exercising access. 4) The court was of the view that the best interests were best served by the mother remaining the primary parent.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time."

The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages.  2) There was no palpable or overriding error on the part of the trial judge as to the extent to which the damage was caused by the defendant's failure to disclose the structural defect. 3) The appellant was self-represented. 4) The court found that the appellant's comments and interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the judge could understand it. 5) In the classic case of R. v. Mohan, the court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. The standard of review in respect to appeals brought pursuant to s. 39 of the Act provides that a party may appeal a judgment made pursuant to that Act to the Court of Queen's Bench within 30 days after the date of the judgment. The appeal is dismissed in the form of an appeal on the record. 6) The Court found that although the appellant had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position that she would have been occupied if the statement had been true, the judge made a palpable and overarching error which affected his assessment of the facts.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation."
81,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court of Appeal dismissed the College's application to hear an appeal from decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The College argued that the Psychologists Act 'confers only a limited right of appeal' within the meaning of s7(2)(a) of the Act. The Court applied to interpret s. 7(3) of The Psychologist Act, 2000 in such a manner that s.7(3)(a)(i) would have no effect and indeed, would overturn such decisions as Borrowman. Section 7(2) is subject to the need to obtain leave with respect to interlocutory decisions and to the two exceptions contained in s. 33 of The Interpretation Act.","HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench."
82,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court held that the plaintiff's amended claim was frivolous or vexatious and that he had no legal right to bring the application. The Court also held that an injunction ordering a fence to be built was beyond the authority of the Court. The court struck out the request for an injunction to be issued ordering the trees to be removed. It found that the plaintiffs had failed to establish what can be regarded as a nuisance, that is an inconvenience interfering with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence, not merely according to elegant or dainty modes and habits of living, but according to community standards.","The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space."
83,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of the charges. The Court ordered a new trial. The Crown had failed to provide sufficient information to defence counsel as to whether the documents were relevant to the trial. It was also ordered that the trial be adjourned. The accused appealed his conviction on the grounds the trial judge erred by refusing to grant an adjournment to allow a proper assessment of the documents. Appeal allowed. 1) The Crown did not conduct any meaningful review of the 1,900 documents listed in the Index and merely relied on the description of each document contained in the index. The trial judge drew the conclusion that the Crown was guilty. 2) The Court was in the position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether they could have affected the verdict. 3) The accused did not take up the Crown's offer to continue to review the documents over the course of the week following the Adjournment Decision. He should have abandoned his application to continue reviewing the documents and he should be precluded from raising the issue before the Court.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."
84,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: Application allowed. 1) The respondent was ordered to pay ongoing spousal support of $10,000 per month and exclusive possession of the family home. The respondent had taken $25,000 from the line of credit after the separation. The court found that the Chambers judge's conclusion that the respondent stopped paying the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities in October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. 2) The appellant was in arrears of $4,476 per month from the time the order was rendered. 3) Even though the appellant was living in the family, there was evidence that the judge was making significant payments with respect to the home to cover the mortgage and insurance costs. 4) The stay was not in effect because the respondent's means were very limited and thus there was a real possibility she would not be able to repay any 'overpayment'.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."

A search warrant was issued and the accused was taken into custody. During the course of his examination-in-chief, the accused went to great length to differentiate the peer-to-peer file sharing network from the centralized server model. The accused requested an opportunity to consult with counsel of his choice. HELD: 1)The accused was not cross-examined. 2)The computer was found to be the exact same file. 3)The court was not satisfied with the evidence presented by the evidence. The court was unable to determine the physical address of the accused.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt."

Appeal allowed. The trial date was set for April 4, 2016.  1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. 2)The Court found the accused guilty of all charges.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable."

The accused did not attempt to call counsel after his arrest and demand for a breath sample. The observation at the detachment was not properly conducted. The police officer did not see the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. The breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol.","HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.

The Court ordered that the Statement of Claim be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant prior to trial commencing. The court found that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was negligent or that the articles were made with malice or calculated to ignore the rights and objections of the plaintiff.","HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages."

The court found that a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid. The plaintiff had received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought. The defendant asked that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a reasonable price. The amount sought was unreasonable.","HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid.

It would be patently unfair for FCC to lull Gillis into a sense of security by renegotiating the deal with the Langille and then, several years later, hold Gillis responsible under the original deal. Quite apart from the question of estopel there are other circumstances which militate against FCC in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is a serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up.

It would be patently unfair for FCC to lull Gillis into a sense of security by renegotiating the deal with the Langille and then, several years later, hold Gillis responsible under the original deal. Quite apart from the question of estopel there are other circumstances which militate against FCC in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is a serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up. These actions were taken without any regard to the impact on the legal rights of Gillis. 2)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the defendants' taxation.","55/45. In an action for professional negligence against a solicitor for failing to obtain specific security requested in written instructions, the plaintiff renegotiated the deal and no longer insisted upon receiving the specific security.

The appellant argued the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. The Minister argued that s19(4) should be applied in a liberal way to allow additional grounds to be argued at this stage. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services was upheld. 1)In order to be eligible for exemption from tax pursuant to clause 10(1)(h) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of the product actually being produced for sale. The function described by the appellant cannot be reasonably said to be fully part of the manufacture or production of its product so as to bring it within, subject to the definition in clause 1(h)(I), the exemption available in s10(1). 2)The appellant argued that it was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process. 3)In this case, the appellant was awarded its costs. 4)The Provincial Tax Commissioner's decision to allow a refund on refrigeration machines was upheld but the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production. 5)The Minister's decision was based on disallowing any exemption for mechanical plumbing and electrical services provided by Germain and by determining that only portion of the refrigerated capacity was used for production purposes. 6)The Court found that the practice of apportionment of this kind has been rejected in Silver Spoons Desserts Enterprises Limited v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), supra, (1989), 89 N.SR. (2d) 363; 227 A.P.R. 363 (S.C.A.D.) which determined there is no power under the Act for the Commissioner to assess tax on a prorated basis based on how the machinery or equipment is used.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."

Later, the hand gun used in the attack was found in the defendant's possession. The defendant pled guilty and was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robberies and one year for the weapons offence to be served consecutively. The judge imposed an order prohibiting the appellant from having firearms, ammunition and explosives for ten years from the date of his release. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentences imposed were consistent with the range that this court has approved in many of its judgments where armed robbery and weapons violations have occurred. These are crimes of violence where strongly deterrent sentences must be imposed.","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The contract allocated the risk for the fire loss to Fraser Brace and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. The appellant issued a builder's risk policy to Fraser- Brace but the policy was never required to carry builder's insurance. The trial judge found that the building was never at the insured's risk and that the policy issued to the insurer was void. He ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire caused the fire. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or Fraser-Bace for causing the loss.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant.

Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.

105,Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The applicant applies for an order that the respondents be prohibited from any further proceedings or actions in relation to a formal complaint against him, dated December 15, 1988, alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor. The court did not deal with a statutory requirement, as is the case before me. This court has the jurisdiction to waive rules but does not have jurisdiction to waiver statutory requirements. Accordingly, the Teskey decision is inapplicable to the matter before it. The powers of the respondents to regulate and discipline its members is conferred by statute and as such, am of the view that the exercise of such powers must be complied with strictly. In Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed. (Sweet Maxwell, London, 1969) at p. 245 the author states: Similarly, statutes dealing with jurisdiction and procedure are, if they relate to the infliction of penalties, strictly construed: compliance with procedural provisions will be stringently exacted from those proceeding against the person liable to be penalised and if there is any ambiguity or doubt it will, as usual, be resolved in his favour. This is so, even though it may enable him to escape upon technicality. Applying s. 27(3) of the Interpretation Act, 1995, conclude that the word'shall' in s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, must be interpreted as imperative. It is mandatory. It was not directory. Disciplinary proceedings expose a member of the Law Society to punishments including suspension of the right to practice and disbarment. The nature of disciplinary proceedings can have devastating effect on the most valuable asset barrister, solicitor and solicitor has his or her reputation. This reinforces my view that s.53(1). must be strictly interpreted. The duty of the Respondents is the protection of the rights not only of members of the public but also the members of Law Society of Saskatchewan. The respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. Leave is given to speak to costs. 1)The Respondents have lost jurisdiction to take further proceedings against the applicant. 2)The respondent's duty is to provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with a decision of the Hearing Committee within 45 days so that disciplinary matters against its members may be dealt with in timely manner. The process must be completed without undue delay and thus protect the member's interest. 3)The applicant may apply to the Court of Appeal for stay pending the decision of his appeal","HELD: The last two sentences were to be substituted by the appeal was dismissed by the SCC on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing."

HELD: 1) The applicant's application was dismissed.  2) The Court found that the actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s. 4, regardless of whether anarrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied. Such payments were consistent with the applicants remaining in possession under a month-to-month tenancy following the expiry of their previous sub- lease in 1997. 3) The applicants have not obeyed the essential requirements of the Act by way of notice of motion. 4) While the applicants established essential requirements for valid renewals of the head lease and their subleases, they failed to agree on its terms. Neither the applicant nor the applicants had initiated an action. Neither had initiated a lease term extending beyond the term of the VIP head lease. 5) The court found that a decision on issue nos. 3 and 4 can dispose of the application and perhaps the issues between the parties. Therefore, the Court will address them. 6) The application was properly before the Court because the arrangements between VIP and the applicants did not constitute an interlocutory motion.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy."

The bankrupt received wrong legal advice concerning the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. The bankrupt argued that he was advised that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors, ie: those relating to the construction of his home.

The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors.

She had exhibited symptoms of ADD and was referred for medical treatment which found there to be ADD. She was placed on medication. The father, after being given safe haven with the Department's assistance for herself and the children, decided after a day or two to go back to and leave the children in the care of his wife.

She remained at home with the child for the first year after his birth. He had only permitted her to see him for four hours on each occasion. 2)S.W.S. had taken steps to deal with her psychological and psychiatric difficulties. She was permitted to see the child on two occasions for eight hours immediately following the alleged attempt at suicide while he was working. 3)The petitioner was to have access for three days each week on the three days he was off work.","The parties were married in September 1996 and subsequently separated in April of 1999. The parties both seek custody of their only child born in October 1997. The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment.

The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother.

The agreement provided that the three brothers would only share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid Milk Quota and not all of the quota sold. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only referred to Fluid milk Quota, and therefore, it was not obligated to share the proceeds of the sale. The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the sale proceeds of any milk quota sold by Lorne Putnam's company, which was to be made up of Fluid and Market Share Quota.

HELD: 1)Questions directed at whether insurance was obtained or paid for the same were not relevant. 2)Questions regarding the number of helicopters on board the helicopters were not obvious to opposing counsel. 3)Questions on the availability of alternative forms of transportation, the cost of such alternatives, the reliability or safety of the alternatives, etc. were proper questions to be asked. Questions relating to the other six theories were clearly irrelevant as they were not raised by the pleadings. 4)The plaintiffs were entitled to discovery of any document or record if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may have either or these consequences.","FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed."

As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments requested.  2) The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. 3) The applicant was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as a plaintiff at the time the action was commenced. The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice by the defendant. Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. The material filed does not establish inexcusable delay. 4) The defendant's claim that it has suffered actual prejudice is not accepted. 5) The application is allowed. The applicants have met s.44(11). As there is no legal obstacle to making amendments requested, as there is, as a starting point, the judge under the new enactment has an unfettered (original emphasis) discretion to grant the application once the twofold threshold onus is met.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause."

The defendant argued that the Agreement was a lease and that liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of the Tariff of Costs. 1) The Agreement was framed as a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. 2) Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by the Saskatchewan farm security Act, the defendant was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance. 3) The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value at the end of the Agreement, in June 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, that value would depend upon market fluctuations. To validate the early repossession in these circumstances would defeat the intention of the legislation to afford protection to farmers against loss of property interests without compliance with legislative provisions by creditors who are governed by the Act. 4) The evidence is clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in does not equal the amount of the advance payments; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9.320). 5) The central issue is whether the agreement is a lease or a security agreement. The parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework of this summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in the circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of a sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest in the spray. The evidence was clear that both parties treated possession and the tradein as an advance payment (but the Agreement does not define it in that way) even though it did not equal that amount of advance payment","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3."

The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the United States and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced, the defendant had not appear and surrender to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court. 2)The Court in Minnesota had jurisdiction because the defendant advertised its business in the state of Minnesota and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address.  3)On an analysis of s. of The Foreign Judgments Act, it could be argued, in my view with some success, that the plaintiff carried on business here. The authorities have quoted support that approach.","The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'."

The Crown had met the necessary burden of proof with respect to the issue of identity. The accused had not testified at the time of the accident and had not been asked how long it had taken him to get out of the truck. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1)The evidence of the driver of the Sunfire was found to be unreliable. 2)There was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of police witnesses during the trial. 3)The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the collision.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

The Crown argued that the accused had not understood or been made aware of what was expected of him and the possible consequences of his failure to appear for trial. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1)The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizee. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware that his creditors were judgment debtors of the Crown. 2)The court found that it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the accused.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence."

In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. HELD: Appeal allowed; s. 15(1) is not an analogous ground upon which to base a claim of discrimination under s.15(1). It is only when death, separation or divorce intervenes that questions of title to property become irrelevant.  1) The concept of a common law spouse is not analogous to discrimination on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. 2) It is not unlike citizenship, recognized as an analogous Ground in Andrews: the individual exercises limited but not exclusive control over the designation. 3) The Court found that the concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, was not discriminatory within the meaning of the Charter. 4) The court found that it was not necessary to make a distinction between the appellant and the respondent because they do not come within the definition in s2(g).","The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter."

The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. She was found guilty of possession of the drug and the other charge against her was stayed. The Crown applied for relief from forfeiture under s. 20(4) of The Controlled Drug Act. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed. 1)The Court found that a person who is charged with a designated substance offence is not entitled to forfeiture. 2)The defendant was found innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offences. 3)The court found that the defendant was not guilty of any of the offences listed in s. 15(3). 4)Section 19(3) does not require a person to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt or on a balance of probabilities that the property is not likely to have been used in the commission of the offence.,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment."
126,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for an order pursuant to Rule 56 in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Halifax Regional School Board to close two schools. All seven applicants were parents of children attending the two schools and none of the applicants had children attending Notting Park. The school was considered for possible permanent closure and the Board recommended that the school be closed. The Board held a special meeting to consider the applicants' application. At that meeting, the Board voted in to close the school and in to ratio to close Notting Park, which was the recommendation of the School Review Committee. The board then held a second meeting to determine whether the school should be closed and if so, whether the decision should be made pursuant to the Closure Policies and Closure Procedures. The applicant raised an issue of standing in relation to the decision to close both schools. The applicants raised concerns about the allocation of scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the mere busybody. HELD: 1) There was no evidence that the applicants were directly affected by the closure of Notting Park or that the Board committed breaches of procedure of such nature as to cause their decisions to be invalid. It was the position of the Board that none of these applicants were aggrieved persons. There was a judicial discretion to find he had public interest standing. There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion.  2) The applicants had not been directly affected. It might be inferred from the documents the enrollment of students in the school would increase but there is no evidence of the extent of any adverse effect on the students in view of the existing vacancies at the school. It is the position that none the applicants are aggrieved individuals. 3) Public interest standing will not normally be granted if it is realistic to expect that the issue in dispute will be determined in another forum or in a different proceeding at the instance of person who would have standing. 4) The applicant had not joined in this application. The Court found that there was not a direct personal interest in the issue before the court to bring him within the general requirement for standing to sue on an injunction to challenge the exercise of statutory power.","The applicants applied for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the school board to close two schools. The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools., application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure. The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue. The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants."

HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the owner had not been in contempt of the order and ordered that he comply with the terms of the Consent Order. The Court ordered that the court issue a contempt order against the owner. The owner was ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $25,000 to the sheriff. The order was also amended to include a prohibition on the use of the property in contravention of the Land Use By-Laws. The plaintiff was also ordered to provide a copy of any written leases or any alternation in the lease or rental of the building.","The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine.

The respondent did not agree to impute income at the pre-trial conference. Without evidence of the earlier gifts there is no means of comparing the present circumstance to the past. The petitioner says the agreement at the trial was not based on gifts but rather what she describes as his true income. The situation is somewhat akin to that where payor, particularly the self-employed, claim his or her income has changed substantially. The onus is on the individual to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children."

The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1) The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injury suffered. 2) The plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. 3) There have been many cases that have found slippery substances such as water or produce on a floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the floors of the produce department. 4) The evidence showed that the defendant met its legal standard for care imposed by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 5) The court found that it was inconsistent with the Court's decision in Bludau-Kugler v. Vancouver Community College (1998), 1997 CanLII 6709 (3d) 74. The plaintiff had met its obligation to the defendant to maintain a clean floor and to ensure that the floors were cleaned at least once per hour. 6) There were many cases in which virtually the same procedures as those followed by the defendant in the case have been previously determined by this Court to have met the standard required. 7) The Court found that there was no adverse inference drawn by virtue of the defendant failing to adduce evidence by Mr. Orban confirming that he had in fact cleaned the floor at 2:52 p.m. and made the entry on the sweep log. 8) There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff's fall occurred some 75 to 90 minutes after the produce floor had been swept.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances."

He appeals his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1)The evidence does not support a guilty verdict for dangerous driving. 2)The trial judge misinterpreted the law with respect to the required elements that must be proven when considering a charge of dangerous. The law doesn't require any longer that the accused's departure be a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those particular circumstances.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition. In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt. The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months. The fine and surcharge were confirmed. 1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred. When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate. 2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law. The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249. Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required. Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient. 3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase. There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses. 4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances. The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct. The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity. It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all. The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea. 5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive. The conduct was at the low end of the continuum. He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living. He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle. Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here."

The premises was located in an area which was subject to the respondent's land use by-laws. The applicant commenced the process whereby it eventually established a private pool hall licensed to sell alcoholic beverages at the above location. The question was whether such a change amounted to a change in use. HELD: The application was granted. The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant did not constitute a change of use. It was clear that initially, the development officers considered the present use of the subject property as a private club to be a non-conforming use. The adverse impact of neighbourhood effects generated by added or modified activities constitutes one of the guiding principles under the common law provinces. The essential issue for consideration is whether the change in a liquor license will constitute a 'change in use' as defined in the By-laws or a development agreement. It is common ground that this operation was conforming to the status quo as it then existed. It stands to reason that the modern regime of land use controls, with their inherent tension between the owner's interest in putting its own property to what it regards as the optimal use and the municipality's interest, should be considered. The fact that the applicant has somewhat modified or extended pre-existing activities within the same general use category does not necessarily mean that the use is conforming.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed."

At trial the Provincial Court Judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the breathalyzer demand. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The findings of the trial judge did not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the appellant had been drinking, had a very slight accident, and failed the SL-2. It was open to him as well on the evidence before him to consider that the accused (a) had bloodshot eyes and (b) had a moderate smell of alcohol on him. In reaching this conclusion, depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result is another conviction.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty. While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds."

The accused had previously been charged with possession of a stolen dog. The court found that the evidence supported the Crown's conclusion that the dog had not been provoked by the accused. The Court also imposed a fine of $200 for the offence committed. HELD: The accused was found guilty of breaking the premises with the assistance of a logging chain affixed to a post.  1)The Court was of the view that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the accused's property. 2)The accused did not take reasonable steps to control the dog. 3)The evidence was not discredited on cross-examination as to what she observed or what she felt. 4)The court accepted the evidence of the complainant's daughter as to the location of the dog in the yard. 5)On the definition of attack, as understand it, the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt the dog does not present a risk to anyone on or off your premises.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns."

In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment."
136,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s.11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to s253(b), s253 and s253 of the Criminal Code. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. The trial was set for December 18, 2003. The length of delay totaled just over 14 months. The court was mindful that the length of the delay was sufficient to raise the issue of reasonableness and the inquiry must turn to the reason why it took 14½ months to bring the accused to trial.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."

HELD: The Court of Appeal chambers judge did not have the authority to make such an order. The father was ordered to pay $600 maintenance for the children. The mother was directed to file her appeal book and factum 15 days after receiving the transcript (which should be March 15, 2004 or shortly thereafter).","This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation."

HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)There was no Charter breach and the Court dismissed the application.  2)The six-month delay was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was not so long as to lead to an inference of prejudice to the accused nor to any potential prejudice to society. 3)The Charter charter breach was founded on the likelihood that if this trial proceeds on the scheduled date then some of the other accused with trials set that date may not be able to have their trial heard.,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence."

The accused was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug contrary to ss.253(a). The evidence of a strong odour of beverage alcohol was not a reliable indicator of impairment. The officer observed the accused drive erratically and erratically. He did not appear to be impaired. The officers observed him smoking marijuana in the vehicle and observed him driving erratically in the daytime. The police stopped the vehicle at approximately 2:30 p.m. and arrested the accused. He was found not guilty of impaired driving. The court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application, and to comment on their relative reliability, it is not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused, who is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face."

He had Cerebral Palsy. He was employed as a truck driver for 12 or 13 years. He claimed that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability. The appellant appealed the decision of the Human Rights Tribunal, arguing that the City had met its duty to accommodate the appellant as an employee of the City. Appeal dismissed; the appellant had not been prejudiced by the considerable time that had elapsed since the complaint took place; the tribunal erred in its interpretation of the concept of 'undue hardship' as it is defined in paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Code; the City and CUPE did not have a duty of accommodating the appellant on the grounds that he made his complaint within the Code's limitation period; the Tribunal erred by failing to find that the city accommodated the appellant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship; the applicant was not guaranteed the right to drive a truck while actually at work. The applicant was awarded a lump sum of $8,902.00 for his injuries.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."
141,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault. The complainant had been drinking and smoking pot at the time of the assault. She testified that the accused backed up the truck and pushed her down and kicked her in the head. She also testified that she fell down and the accused pushed her on the ground. She said she was trying to get her mother into the house when the accused grabbed her and punched her. The accused admitted that he slung her on her back and that he got more aggressive and kicked the complainant on two occasions. The evidence of tire marks on the driveway cannot be accepted as having any impact on the case nor is it suggested by the Crown that they should. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The evidence of the complainant's fall on the concrete driveway raised the issue of whether the accused operated a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the intention of the accused. The Crown has proven the guilt of the guilty on both counts to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Crown has failed to prove the guilty of all counts. The injuries to the complainant were accidental and the result of intervening events. 3)The accused admitted to slunging Bear on his back and in doing so caused her bodily harm. 4)There was no doubt that the injuries to Bear were accidental. There was no evidence that some of the bruises sustained by Bear may have resulted from her fall on a concrete driveway and some may have been occasioned by Darnell when she accidentally stepped on her mother's face. 5)The Court found the accused guilty on all counts except for Count No. 249. The Court found that the Crown had failed in its duty to prove both the mens rea and actus reus of the charge. The offence was not committed in the manner described by the complainant.,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault."

It is not sufficient to merely state that the defendant has good defence upon the merits; the affidavits must show the nature of the defence and set forth facts which will enable the court or judge to decide whether or not there was a matter which would afford defence to the action.,FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated. 1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. 2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002. No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.
143,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an application to vary a corollary relief judgment issued in 1998, varied in 2001, and varied in June 2005. The respondent sought a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. HELD: 1) The respondent was entitled and continues to be entitled by virtue of her continuing inability to become self-sufficient. The court must be mindful of the other factors set out in the Divorce Act as considered by the court. 2) The applicant's income has increased to some extent, in all other respects her circumstances are the same as they were at the time of the granting of the divorce. Although the applicant had some employment since retirement, his income is reduced. She has home and could take in boarders. The extent of the spouse's obligation to meet the other's financial needs depends on the length of the relationship, the ability to pay, any repartnering of the former spouses, and the other obligations of the parties. 3) The court found that the respondent's need for support and the applicant's need to see an end to this obligation were the same.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support."

The complainant was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Court found that the complainant was the victim of a sexual assault and that the accused was the one who had made the comments to her.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her."

The victim was found to be incompetent to testify and so the Crown sought to admit the victim's out of court statement for the truth of her allegations. The Crown alleged that the victim choked him until she thought she was going to die and then sexually assaulted her. HELD: The evidence was admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissibility of similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. 1)The evidence was admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence and its necessity. 2)The trial judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the relevant evidence whose prejudice outweighs any probative value is excluded outweighs the prejudice of its admittance. 3)Hearsay evidence is presumptively admissible, without the need for voir dire, if it falls under an established exception to a hearsay rule because the exceptions all have certain inherent reliability. 4)The court found that the principles of the principled approach apply to the admission of similar facts evidence. 5)The fact that the evidence is admissible in a case where the complainant and the similar fact witness had met prior to the alleged sexual assault and discussed the accused's criminal record, the witness's previous abuse suffered by the accused and the money the witness received from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for the sexual abuse were admissible. The court found there must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."

The plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. He remained in custody until 7:30 a.m. that morning. The police officers arrested the plaintiff and removed him from the lounge for being intoxicated. The events leading up to the arrest involved the police arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for be intoxicated in a public place. HELD: The plaintiff was found guilty of unlawful arrest, assault, and obstruction of police officers. 1) The plaintiff's actions were not in dispute. The actions of the defendants were in dispute and the plaintiff did not require transportation to the hospital. 2) There was no evidence of obstruction by the defendant. The defendant was not physically involved with the arresting officers. The action of the police officers was not directed at the plaintiff. 3) The Court was unable to accept the evidence of the manager as it was at odds with what the other witnesses say and because her evidence did not distinguish between the police officer and the accused as to who did what. 4) The events outside of the lounge were not largely in dispute but vary in minor detail only.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext."

Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares. The plaintiff requested that the affidavit of the defendant be struck, arguing that there was no defence to the action on the merits. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the corporation was insolvent. The Court found that s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act does not prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s.34(2). 2) The Court was of the view that s34(1) did not prevent it from seeking a summary judgment. The application for the summary judgment against the defendant was dismissed on the basis that the defendant had not provided any professional analysis or affidavit evidence in support of their proposition that s33(2)(b) is applicable. 3) There was no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiff’s investment in the defendant. The realizable value of the corporation”s assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and amount that would be required to be paid to other shareholders who had right to be compensated on redemption or in liquidation, rateably with or in priority to the plaintiff. 4) The court was of a view that the Act does nothing to prevent the defendant from seeking the summary relief. The Act does, however, not prevent a plaintiff seeking summary judgement from the court. It does not require the defendant to make any payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs."

The van had broken down in a handicap parking area and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff had joined ING Halifax under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. He claimed to have sold the van to the second individual, who he later identified as the owner of the van. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff was the owner and that the van was not in driveable condition at the time of the incident. The Court concluded that the facts were very much in dispute. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the identity of the vehicle, the owner's identity and whether the driver had the owner’s consent to operate it when the incident occurred.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle."

HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one Sandra Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to her. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. 2) The evidence of the complainant's friend who testified that she bought drugs from the appellant and that she sold them to him was completely inconsistent with her being the owner of the methamphetamine which was found virtually in plain view. 3) The Court found the appellant guilty on the count of possession for sale. 4) The fresh evidence was of no assistance to the accused. The Crown had proven each and every essential ingredient of the charge to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore found the accused guilty on that count.,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered."

HELD: The certification application is dismissed. 1) The plaintiff has no cause of action against any of the defendants by reason of the expanded limitation of liability provisions as contained in the Montreal Convention. The plaintiff is entitled to recover damages against the defendants for negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement. 2) The defendant is liable for the tort of unlawful confinement by refusing to permit the passengers to disembark from the aircraft during the period in question after several passengers requested that they be allowed to leave. 3) There is no question that Flight 361 from Punta Cana, Dominican Republic to Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, was an international flight and thus the provisions of the Montreal convention are applicable. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed exclusively by the Convention, which provides the sole cause and only remedy for all claims arising in relation to Flight 361, including all claims for bodily injury suffered by passengers. The applicant provided the Court with the decision of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd., which involved a claim against a commercial airline and package operator arising from a crash landing. Although the court would have dismissed the certification application on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria set out in s. 6(a) of the Act, for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, the court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext."

The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? The individual items are as follows: non-arm's length salaries; personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses; capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and a capital allowance on personal property owned and leased by the respondent. HELD: 1) The court found that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to a conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The Court found no costs awarded to either party.  2) It was far from certain that the maintenance of $728 previously agreed (which represented an income of $40,000) was categorically wrong. It may well be high or low but adjustment can be made in the account between the parties in due course.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."

HELD: The Court found that the respondent’s right to counsel was violated and in excluding a certificate of analysis, acquitted him. The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that there had been a breach of the respondent and that the breach of his right to be counsel went directly to his right against self-incrimination. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded as it would be unfair to proceed with the trial with it going in, given the circumstances. The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean that the Respondent”s waiver was not valid. The police did not take the opportunity, as required, to give additional information to the accused when he changed his mind about seeking legal counsel.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."

The parties had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. HELD: The Court found that the lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore it was not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of the PPSA. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for more than 1 year' and it required registration. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that the Bank became aware of the equipment lease and granted it an option to purchase the equipment for purchase price of $212,000.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."

HELD: 1) The respondent's application to vary was dismissed. 2) There was no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the part of the petitioner. The respondent had not engaged in bloddy conduct. 3) The petitioner's obligation to pay child support for both children ceased. 4) The court found that the respondent's delay between June 2004 and July 2006 constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. The petitioner had been content to accept the sum of $380 per month as fair level of child support. 5) The Court dismissed the respondent’s application for retroactive child support because the petitioner had not shown that she had breached the agreement.,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed."

The applicant was not precluded from seeking further costs after the discovery of the expert who had provided an affidavit in support of the application.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract.

The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body. His right hand and arm were burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."

The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as a result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)Any claim at this point would have to be made by her daughter, not her as she had no further standing, having legally divested title and not received any less value on the sale of the property in the process. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now used to this effect.  2)The plaintiff's action cannot succeed for the following reasons: a)the Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions were provided to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates a request for final billing. This is not construed to be negligence by the Town nor is it negligence by any of the parties involved. 3)The evidence clearly demonstrated a misunderstanding of what the defendant believed was the proper procedure for disconnection requests.

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her."

The original custody judgment provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The mother failed to notify the father as to the child's whereabouts and prevented the father from exercising the shared parenting. HELD: 1) There was a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible. 2) The mother demonstrated that it would not be in the child’s best interests to move to Whitehorse because it would limit her access because of the distance between Saskatoon and Whitehorse. 3) The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. 4) The threshold test having been met was whether there was a change in circumstances which would allow the father to have sole custody. 5) The child was well adjusted and acts like an average five-year-old. 6) The father was granted sole custody and access. 7) The court was satisfied that there had not been a material difference in the conditions affecting the child. The child had been well cared for by both parents.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly."

The Board of Governors made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. 2) The Board reviewed and then had reference to portions of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Collective Agreement. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test.  3) The decision was reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it is clear the standard of review to be applied in this case is one of reasonablety. 4) The Employer violated the collective agreement and was harassing and intimidating actions against the faculty member in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.

The plaintiff's claim was grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which states that the union is entitled to indemnify its officers for actions done in the course of their office that made them the subject of the plaintiff's, or others, litigation. The union resisted the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the indemnity by-law and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association. Exhausting internal remedies. 1) The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of a high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 2) In the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts, the debate in the fourth action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. 3) In this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified under the terms of the union's by law. The dispute is in its essential character, contractual in nature; namely, is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of the indemnITY clause in the union by-Laws? 4) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of indemnity. In that respect, the contest in this case is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The argument between the plaintiff and Union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. 5) In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, the court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff”s claim and his application for summary judgment.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success."

The bankrupt argues that allowing him a reasonably frugal family lifestyle will not permit him to pay his liabilities under the loan. HELD: The bankrupt is entitled to relief under s 178(2.1). The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. The debt is now approximately $20,000. He has been unable to repay his student loan liabilities for the past several years. He will have to consider bankruptcy to eliminate this liability. He does not have the resources to discharge this liability now nor in the next several years to eliminate it.","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."

He ordered the appellant to pay 73% of the children's extracurricular activities, including day care, orthodontics, music lessons, and children's extraordinary activity costs. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the chambers judge erred in failing to consider and apply the definition of'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. The parties agreed that they would pay 50% of their after tax work related day care costs but that the respondent would be responsible for all of the activities. The respondent applied for specified changes in the parenting arrangement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law. The order did not interfere with the exercise of discretion by the court. 2) The appellant was found to be entitled to pay proportionate share of the extricular activities he listed. 3) The respondent's expenses were ordinary and were not extraordinary. 4) There was no finding that these expenses exceeded what the respondent could reasonably cover taking into account her income and the appellant’s contribution to health care and day care expenses.","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal."

The contract was frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. The plaintiff intended to construct a glass wall sunroom on the back of the home. The defendant refused to supply concrete pilings to be the foundation for the proposed structure. The court found that the contract was beyond the control of the parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of the deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendants counterclaimed for $176.22. The Court found that a just and reasonable resolution demanded the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The damages claim was dismissed.,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."
166,Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"FIAT. The parties had two children, Kayden and Nolan, born February 28, 2003 and December 28, 2004. The respondent was employed as a hotel supervisor and worked two weeks a week for two weeks followed by one week off. The petitioner sought an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the children born of his relationship with the respondent. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. The court ordered that access be provided for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August. The fiat did not address the fact that the petitioner would be laid off for two months in the spring. It was reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. 2) The petitioner's work schedule had not changed. He still works two weeks of 12 hour days (8:00 a.m. 8:00 p.m.) followed by a week off in July. The access schedule as detailed by Ryan-Froslie J. shall remain unchanged. 3) The order in issue here is an interim one. It is more in the nature of an application, not to vary, but to address holiday periods not contemplated or addressed in the February 1, 2007fiat. The affidavits filed show a significant amount of animosity between the parties. It appears unlikely that they will be able to agree on much, if anything. Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time. 4) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order."

The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

He was sentenced immediately following his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the evidence was part of the 'narrative' and that the words were meant to be taken seriously in the context of the case. The evidence was not prejudicial to the trial. The trial judge did not address any of the instances of prejudicial or hearsay evidence that came in through the witness.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."

In 2001 they divorced and Corollary Relief Judgment was granted. They have two children born June 1986 and January 17, 1990. In 2008, the parties separated and the respondent applied for retroactive child support. The respondent argued that he did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The petitioner argued that retroactive support was not justified because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. HELD: 1)The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the petitioner's application to vary retroactive to the date when the respondent received effective notice of his intention to seek an increase in support payments. 2)The respondent did not provide any other significant financial support to their son since April 2008 and could not tell the court how he was meeting his support obligations or inform the court of his financial circumstances generally. The mother's evidence on the subject was speculative and conjecture. 3)Given the issue of the court's jurisdiction it is not necessary for the court to consider whether the respondent is engaging in blameworthy conduct. 4)The parties' relationship as parents was defined by the Corollaries relief judgment in D.B.S. (2009) as a result of which the Court did not exercise jurisdiction to determine the retroactive amount of child support awarded to the petitioner.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father."

The Counterclaim was based on the fact that the trees were at the far edge of the claimants' land and not part of their 'view' from the house. The claim against the Defendant was dismissed. The Court found that the defendant was not jointly or vicariously responsible for the actions of the defendant. The court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. The Claimants were awarded costs of $1,234.90 plus HST for tree removal and $2,000.00 for repairs to the claimant's septic field.","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial."

The company argued that the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact that the sale price of the mall did not amount to an arm's length sale because Ontrea was not a 'willing' buyer. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The sale price satisfied the criteria set out in the Assessment Manual. 2) It was not open to either the Board of Revision or the Committee to have regard for sale verification information to the exclusion of other information before the Board as was relevant and not excluded from consideration by s.172(5) of The Cities Act. 3) The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties and are called upon to make a number of decisions largely on a basis of fact that emerges through this process. Nor was the Committee convinced that the Assessor erred.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed."

The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clements was supported by probative evidence. The trial judge was overly generous to the appellant in even embarking on an analysis of the potential weapon to invalidate the contract.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis."

The plaintiffs were awarded quantum of damages. 6) The defendant was found only 20 responsible for damages sustained. 7) The plaintiff's possession was assessed at $250. The court found that in all the circumstances the defendant was only 20.","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."

He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter too severe. Dismissing his appeals with oral reasons, that the trial judge clearly indicated that it should place special, or indeed any, weight on the appellant's assessment of his credibility. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons. 1) The appellant's evidence as to the identity of the driver of the white Tempo was undercut by numerous considerations. The appellant did not testify at trial. He pointed to the grow-op as his vehicle. He did not say anything about it being dusty at the time of the offence. The trial judge did not call the police officer who was in the patrol car with him. He said nothing about the roadside ditch. The police officer was not operating his cruiser when the Tempo went by. He had stopped the cruiser and engaged the emergency lights. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with an erroneous sense of their significance. It was open to the jury to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver. The judge's caution about changes in physical condition adequately put that issue into a proper perspective.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

In the same judgment, the learned trial judge acquitted the appellant of a second charge of operating a vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in law in his decision to exclude the evidence of the Crown's defence counsel. The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility because he was able to observe the accused and had worked with him on previous occasions and was comparing his observations to the testimony of other witnesses. The evidence as statement of fact was clearly not admissable to prove that the appellant was in fact impaired. 2)The appellant's evidence concerning the appellant's slurred speech was not part of conscripted evidence which would place the administration of justice into disrepute in Charter analysis. The learned judge's findings were inadmissible. 3)The Court was satisfied the appellant had not shown any inherent improbability in his evidence or any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with his findings.","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict."

The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."

The complainant testified that she was assaulted and that the defendant choked her and she grabbed his testicles in defence. The accused claimed that he had punched her in the face and that he threatened to kill her. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. The Crown had proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found the accused guilty of unlawful confinement. The evidence raised the issue of credibility. The court accepted the complainant's testimony about the incidents at the hotel and the defendant's denial that the complainant was the driving force in obtaining the cocaine. However, the Court found that the accused had not acted within the definition of'reasonable doubt' as to whether sexual assault occurred. The defendant was found guilty of the following charges: Sexual assault; Assault Causing Bodily Harm; Intoxication; Intention to cause bodily harm; Intimidation of recognizance. The statements made by the accused were inconsistent and inconsistent. The statement by the complainant that she had been assaulted by the defendant was not supported by the evidence.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial."
186,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault involving a 14 year old girl. The accused had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant for approximately 15 years prior to the alleged incidents. The complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused when she was between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim in a manner that violated the victim's sexual integrity. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all four counts. 1)The accused's credibility was a mixture of their reliability (are they now accurately recalling matters they had proper opportunity to observe and commit to memory in the past?) and impartiality or honesty. The evidence suggested that the complainant was not proved to be living with the accused or in the Road area before the accused moved in with her. 2)There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household lived for what period of time, which has implications for where and when the alleged offences are to have taken place. 3)The evidence of each household member was examined in an objective fashion to determine whether the conduct was of sexual nature or improbable. 4)The Crown's position as to whether the accused committed any of the offences was that of a person under the age of 16 years, and that the evidence was inconsistent with the evidence presented by the Crown.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end."

The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was convicted and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and 10 months probation. He appealed the decision of the Romanian court, which increased his sentence to three years imprisonment, and reduced his probationary term to 5 years. He now resides with his common law partner of four years but offers minimal information about his intended activities upon release. He owns no real property and has identified no significant activities which connect him to the jurisdiction. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for judicial inter alia release in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of a risk of non-appearance more severely than might otherwise be acceptable in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Code.  2)The application is for interim judicial release.  3)It is sufficient that the applicant has met the threshold of a flight-risk. It is not sufficient that he has not met that threshold.  4)In light of the committal order, the accused's status is a 'convention refugee' and his status as an international refugee affords an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should surrender himself into custody given the circumstances.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed."

The accused was sentenced to 18 months secure custody followed by a period of probation concurrent to the probation order. The young person had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence. He was permanently disabled as a result of the assault. The harm to the victim was intentional and foreseeable and the harm to his family was intentional.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required."

The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of impaired driving. The Court found no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analyses was excluded. 1)The Court found that the accused had reasonable grounds for making the demand for breath samples and that the grounds for the demand were objectively reasonable. 2)Any potential violation of the accused's Charter rights would fall toward the lower end of the spectrum. The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect by the officer; what was lacking was a smell of or admission of consumption of alcohol. 3)The accused displayed very significant symptoms of impairment and drove in a fashion indicative of marked departure from the norm. The arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights of his accused were violated. 4)The officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. The only question is whether the accused has reasonable grounds in the face of a breach so created. The Certificate of Analysis should not be excluded given the reasoning of R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded."
190,Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide a breath sample. The accused had been operating a motor vehicle for four and one half years. The issue before the Court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor car as defined by the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The evidence was not conclusive. The evidence did not support the Crown's position that the bike was a vehicle as defined in the Criminal code. 2) The Crown failed to prove that the accused's GiO bike was an electric bike. The Crown had failed to show that the motor vehicle was operating when the accused blew into the approved screening device twice. His second breath registered a fail result. 3) There were some problems with the evidence. The defence did not cross examine the accused. 4) The court was unable to decide whether there were pedals on the bike.,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.

The plaintiff entered into a merger/purchase agreement with MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement in 1999. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The parties entered into an arbitration agreement pursuant to which they were bound by the terms of the merger agreement. The agreement provided that by virtue of clause 2.11 of the agreement, that agreement would prevail if there was a conflict between the agreement and the merged agreement. HELD: The action was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.  1) There are no other provisions in s.8(2) that apply to this situation that may result in refusal to stay the proceedings. There are only provisions in section 19 of the Act that apply. 2) Arbitration at any time while this Agreement and any of the agreements is in force is a question of law and must be determined by the courts and not the arbitrator.","The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act. The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement.

The Court also found that the Court was not satisfied that the draft order provided for trials to be conducted in the manner that best achieved the goals of the joinder of actions.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence.

In his statement of claim the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of the defendant. The defendant responded by seeking an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules striking the within actions on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They also opposed certification of the within proceedings on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Dismissing the application, that the chambers judge erred in law in failing to properly apply the Anns test when determining whether a claim of negligence is a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c). The chambers judge could not be said to have erred by not taking these factors into account when dealing with the Rule 173 application.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act."

He was 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He is looking to retire in the next few years and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support and $249 per month in s. expenses. The court found that in the absence of some special circumstance the respondent should not have paid child support because he did not have the ability to pay it at the time that they were incurred. He did not owe child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 2) The court was unable to find that the respondent did not pay child support. It was not possible to calculate the amount of support owed by the respondent. The respondent's income was varied from year to year. He had a pension income of $109,912 which brought his annual child support obligation to $1.683. 3) The child support owed was reduced by $20,196 and the s. support was $2,988 for a total arrear of $23,184. 4) The Court found that the child was a child of the marriage and therefore the respondent's child support obligations should be calculated using the income he actually earned. 5) There was no undue hardship to either party. The child was not a child born to the respondent until he ceased paying child support in 2001. 6) The father was entitled to child support for life. 7) In the absence a special circumstance, the arsars should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay and will not in the future be able to pay. 8) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse until she upgraded her education. The petitioner is on long-term disability. 9) There were arsages in respect to both orders. The father had not been paid for some time. The arreary was $183,746. The wife was on long term disability. She continued to care for the children for the rest of her life. 10) The wife had no income. She did not earn enough to pay for the child's care. 11) The mother's ars were $186,747.","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."
195,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had a previous record of sexual interference on children. He had two previous convictions for assault, and a persistent problem with alcohol. The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence and imposed a 20 month sentence of imprisonment. 1)The Court found that the accused was at the lower end of the continuum with respect to sexual assaults, and that his record established a pattern of sexual assaults. The offences were of a distinctly sexual nature. Although there was a claim of bruising, the accused indicated that his back problem prevented him from gaining employment. The court found that a conditional sentence order for a'serious personal injury offence' which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. 2)The accused was found guilty of sexually assaulting his 14 year old sister. The Crown argued that the record of the accused establishes a pattern and that the appropriate sentence is a sentence of two years incarceration followed by three years probation. 3)The court also found that sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, at the time of the offences, are of a very low risk to re-offend. Sexual assault is defined as a serious sexual injury offence which carries a maximum sentence of 10 year imprisonment when that case was prosecuted. Sexual assaults involve inappropriate touching, and are of short duration. The violence used against the complainant was minimal, resulting in'redness instead of bruising'. The accused was in a position of trust with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently."

The plaintiff had been advised by the law firm that the terms of the agreement for sale and sale were the same matter and that their continued occupation constituted a trespass to land. The lawyer had not been advised of the relationship between the firm and the former client. The solicitor had been instructed by the Holgates to ensure the purchase of the personal care home was conditional upon the sale of their farm property. The Holgaters had not advised the plaintiff that the agreement was conditional on the sale and that they would have to retain a different lawyer. HELD: 1) The court found that the relationship was not a conflict between the law firms and the parties were not bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against former clients. 2) There was no conflict of interests between the lawyers. 3) The Court found that a solicitor's duty to former clients is simply an adjunct to a lawyer's underlying duty to refrain in using confidential information received from former clients and that requiring them to do so defeats the very purpose the protection was intended to convey.  4) While it is true the parties failed to raise a conflict issue prior to issuance of the plaintiff's statement of claim and that the parties' correspondence was unnecessarily long if the purpose of the meeting was simply to obtain non-contentious, basic facts or contact information to fill in a form-based document, an obvious conflict existed which requires court intervention in the broader administration of justice.  5) Even if the defendants' failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings was relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.
197,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused provided his name and address to the police officer, his licence was suspended and his birthday was September 24, 1990. The officer warned him that if he lied about his identity, he could be charged with obstructing a peace officer. The police officer provided the accused with a Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention to Tender Certificate, which he received on a promise to appear at trial. The Certificate was never tender and the accused was released on an Appearance Notice. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)An in-court identification of the accused is not necessary; it is sufficient that the individual with whom he dealt has surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice and the service on a lawyer may not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. 2)The Certificate of Disclosure or Prohibition is admissible because it is signed by the accused and signed by him. 3)Although there was no 'dock identification' evidence, the Crown relied on the fact that the officer satisfied himself of the identity of the driver by reference to a photograph maintained by government agency. The certificate was not admissible. 4)The Court found that the accused admitted knowledge of his licence disqualification and the dates on which he might become eligible to obtain a driver's licence were not in issue.","The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed."
198,Non_IRC | Issue | Reason | Conclusion | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"The Lawless children were the plaintiffs' parents in an action against the defendant for failing to meet their commitments to the school and whether the school was doing enough to accommodate the eldest child's special educational needs. The Lawless applied for and were granted provisional permission to attend the school in 2013-2014. The Court dismissed the application for an interlocutory injunction and the application to strike out the plaintiffs’ claim. HELD: The Court found that the Lawless family’s failure to live up to their ten commitments was not the real reason for their decision to not renew their provisional permission. The court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school because of the ongoing problems between the parents and the school administration.  1) The Court concluded that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-residents to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion. 2) The court concluded that the lawless family had failed to meet its obligations under s. 42.1 of the Education Act and s. 38(3) of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. It was therefore in their best interests that the children continue to attend. 3) The children must leave the school permanently at the end of this school year because support for their success does not exist in this case. 4) There was no evidence that the CÉF had deliberately interfered with the children’ s. 12(1) commitments or intentionally interfered with their ability to participate in the school process.  5) The parents were unable to explain how the Court concluded the Court was unable to understand the mandate of the school.  6) There were no grounds for the Court to conclude that the Court had not acted in good faith.","Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."

The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge found the accused's suspicion was not reasonable and, in breach of s. and of the Charter, there was no violation of the accused s. rights under s. 24(2). The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out in R. v. Jacques, [1996] SCC 49 (CanLII), [2009] and [2010] R.v. Biniaris. The Court found the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the officer to demand a sample of his breath into an ASD. The court found that the officer relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. The nervousness and lack of desire to explain what he was doing and the time of the incident were not factors that will be taken into account in determining the reasonable grounds of the suspicion.",The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.
200,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the Court set by it. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the reserve bid in judicial sale was granted. The court ordered that the reserve bidder be appointed as selling officer. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. The Court ordered that a solicitor be appointed to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The application to confirm the sale must be brought by notice of application. The only information before the court as to the value of this mortgaged land is a “residential desktop report” appraisal completed January 8, 2014, which appraises the mortgaged property at market value of $85,000 to $125,000. Plaintiff’s counsel states that no one has inspected the house. The reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. Since some of the terms of the draft proposed order nisisi for a judicial sale are matters that have cautioned the plaintiff and the defendants about on previous applications, it is appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs. Plaintiff's counsel may obtain date for the next court proceeding from the local registrar.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful."
201,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court held that it was appropriate to determine the defendants' application for summary judgment. The Court found that the defendants had failed to show a genuine ability to prove one or more factual elements to a class action, and that the plaintiffs' argument set out in their brief had no factual basis. The court found that there was a genuine issue with respect to whether the defendants misled consumers. It held that the Court had jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiffs had been misled by the misleading and deceptive advertising of the defendants.",HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.
202,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant had not been paid in full for the six years since the last bill was rendered. The respondent had not received any written retainer from the respondent. There were no problems with the bill at the time of the application. The court found that the respondent was entitled to the assessment and the time for the assessment was limited to 30 days. The question was whether the respondent could effectively gather together the information on all of the matters he provided legal services in relation to so as to explain each item in an assessment as requested by Cowessess.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated."
203,Conclusion | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC Document : ,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was reinstated. The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in the approach he took to measure the appellant's use of force, and in disregarding the evidence of the complainant. The appeal court judge concluded that the appellant was justified in kicking the complainant in the abdomen, causing him to fall and injure himself. The court found the appellant had not shown that the officer's subjective belief as to the nature of the danger or harm caused him to use less force than was necessary to protect himself or herself.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm."
204,Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of assault and breach of a protective order. The Court concluded that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant’s residence and that apprehension was justified. The court ordered the exclusion of the evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the complainant. The accused was not in hot pursuit of the complainant and had not seen the father of the children. The fact that the mother had directed the accused not to have contact with the children did not alter the situation. The evidence was not conclusive that the child protection worker had breached the protection order.,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
205,Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,HELD: The accused was charged with impaired driving and care or control of a motor vehicle. The Court found that the accused had reasonable suspicion that she had two shots that night and that she did not display multiple signs or indicia of impairment. The delay in arriving at the scene was attributed to the delay in the police officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene until some thirty-five minutes after he arrested the accused. The court found that there was no compelling reason or need to wait for the tow truck. The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there were several businesses around and adjacent to the scene. The police officer made the demand before asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. He failed to articulate the grounds for a reasonable suspicion.,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code."
206,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. The Court ordered a curative discharge based on the following factors: 1) the accused had two prior convictions for drinking and driving; 2) her criminal record; 3) her dedication to the AA program; and 4) the fact that she had been through the program for drinking drivers offered at the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre.,"HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years."

The father was ordered to have access with the children every second weekend for seven years. The grandmother was the primary caregiver for the children and the father was to have supervised access with them. The court ordered that the children be supervised for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend and that the father be supervised by the grandmother. The mother was granted interim custody of the children in January 2016. The parties were to have the children live with the grandmother for a period of approximately two years. In the interim order, the father would have access only with the grandparents for three days in a four-week period. The grandparents were to split the spring and Easter holidays on an equal basis.","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support."

He was sentenced to six years imprisonment plus a fine of $800.00 for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The accused was also sentenced to 10 years probation. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of all of the offences listed in the Criminal Code, including driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood, failing to recognize stopped vehicles in the construction zone and failing to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop.  1) The Court was aware of the pain the families had and were experiencing as a result of the accident. The Court took note of the Gladue information contained within the pre-sentence report filed with the Court.  2) There was no evidence that the accused had ever travelled on Highway No. in Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and in particular, had ever driven through the construction zones south of Spalding, Saskatchewan, within which this fatal accident occurred. 3) There were no Gladue factors listed in s. 718.2(e) of the Code.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code.

The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age.

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend."

The respondent filed an answer and counter petition opposing the petitioner’s claim for shared parenting and an equal division of the family home and property and prohibiting the respondent from removing D.K. from the jurisdiction. The petitioner argued that the respondent’ s.2 credit was inadequate and that he should be paid spousa and child tax in the amounts of $4,250 per month until he retired. The Court also found the respondent to be entitled to child support based on the petitioner and the respondent having a child together. The court found the father to be in breach of the terms of the child support agreement and ordered him to pay $1.5 million in child support and $5.5M spouso. The child was to remain with the petitioner for the duration of his residency. HELD: 1) The Court held that the petitioner was entitled to a portion of his child support for the purposes of the Children’S Health Insurance Program. The father was to receive the rest of his income from the program. 2) The petitioner was not entitled to any other income. The children were to be cared for by the father. 3) The court noted that the father had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and that the nature of his practice is unpredictable.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."

The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded."
