d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","Where an accused is charged with an offence under s. 151, 152, 153, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 346 or 347, the presiding judge or justice may make an order directing that the identity of the complainant or of witness and any information that could disclose the identity shall not be published in any document or broadcast in any way. The appellant appealed his convictions. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence we cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and accordingly the appeal is dismissed. 2)The appellant denied assaulting the complainants. The trial judge sentenced him to nine months imprisonment with respect to the assault on B.J.R. to be followed by two years probation. The sentence on the second count was 1 month consecutive."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10. The plaintiff claims that the October 2006 agreement referred to the wrong parcel of land and seeks rectification on the basis of mutual mistake. The other defendant, Mr. Sterling, is a beneficial owner of all the shares, assets and undertaking of Sterling Farm and was (it is alleged) party to the harvesting contract, along with Sterling Farm. The plaintiffs entered a formal Timber Cutting Agreement and Lease relating to the same property in 2006. While the plaintiff alleged that action was being taken to migrate the title of several properties owned by Sterling Farm, the defendant alleged that the action was preparatory to selling or otherwise encumbering said properties to put the same beyond the reach of his creditors. The defendant argued that the attachment order had hindered or prevented it from resuming operations. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause. The attachment order must be terminated.  The plaintiff was not satisfied that the plaintiff had established any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and the court is satisfied that its existence will hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The officers observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer'. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligram, respectively. HELD: The Certificate of Analysis was dismissed. 1)It is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. The use of certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. It is not possible to know who made the alteration consisting of the striking out of the word and symbol “Breathalyzer®” and the writing in of “3” which bears his initials. While it is probably the same person made the same alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. 2)The certificate is only a shortcut afforded the Crown by virtue of the fact that it is only afforded to it. If the Crown had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the approved instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. There was no evidence that the qualified technician states in the certificate that an approved instrument was employed. If Parliament had intended to change the expression of the year from 19 to 2003, it was bound by it."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, sought joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the parties based their October 2005 verbal agreement for child support on the petitioner's 2004 income and that the respondent refused to allow him parenting time if he '...did not agree to pay her the amount of child support she demanded''. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes.  2) The petitioner was not prepared on an interim basis to deduct the $9,600 from her 2006 income. Given the lack of financial disclosure by the petitioner, am not prepared to vary the terms of that agreement.  3) There was nothing in the evidence before the court sufficient to rebut that presumption. The court must be satisfied additional money is actually available and that it can be paid to the shareholders without endangering the financial viability of the company. The status of the children is of limited assistance. Retained earnings are shareholder's 'equity' in the corporation (its assets less its liabilities). They do not reflect the cash available for distribution. 4) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be in the cause."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the tenant's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy was declared to have not been converted.  1)The Landlord was entitled to make a reasonable business decision and not be second guessed by tenants, Residential Tenancy Officers or Adjudicators simply because they do not agree with the landlord. 2)The tenant had the advantage of the landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009). He would be exposed to the very financial risk that he seeks to avoid.  3)The landlord was directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. In the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT: The applicant sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002. The parties' oldest child, Jasmine, was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and her s. 7(f) expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The child was still a child of the marriage. She was employed full-time and the father was paying child support of $534 per month. 2)The father's income had increased since the May 2002 order. The mother's failure to terminate the father's contribution for her son's extracurricular activities was reprehensible. The father's obligation to contribute for his son's hockey, golf and baseball expenses was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 3)There was no evidence as to the reasonableness of the mother's position as to whether or not the father had received money from the father for this expense when it was not actually incurred. The evidence did not establish that the bingos were not split. 4)The mother was not entitled to the costs of the family law proceeding."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

The issues also relate to some 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. Leave to appeal this ground is denied. The test on such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The Committee did not view the matter as one of assessor discretion but saw it as a matter of professional interpretation of data. The key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure, particularly as it may relate to the general, though not necessarily so confined. Raising issues of that sort only adds to what are often substantively burdensome applications, making it more difficult to knife through to the core and hence more difficult obtain leave. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant."
b_1995canlii3936.txt,"The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property. A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on a young offender following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. For the four offences, the accused escaped lawful custody, escaped custody, stole property valued at more than $1,000, and committed dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) and dangerous driving.

9_1996canlii5086.txt,"The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.",The 21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. The Crown concedes this was 'technically a robbery' and concedes it was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. HELD: The conviction appeal is dismissed and a sentence of 1 year incarceration is imposed along with a 10 year section 100 Order. 1)The Crown concedes the incident was technically a robbery and that what originally would have been a simple shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and appellant. In these circumstances it is appropriate to allow the sentence appeal and to reduce the sentence to one year incarceration with a s.100 order. 2)Sentencing was allowed to continue as scheduled.
c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.",The wife sought a more favourable division of assets. She also sought an entitlement to the appellant's health insurance. The husband cross-appealed. He also sought access by way of an easement over his home property. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without costs. The court found no error in finding the amount owed for the proceeds was approximately half-way between the two claims and then setting off against the amount owing to the respondent for the real property and the vehicles. The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's approach.
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. On the basis that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order was made (Wilson v. Grassick (1994), 1994 CanLII 4709 (SK CA), R.F.L. (4th) 291 (Sask. C.A.) cited with approval in Gordon v. Goertz), the court found that as no material change had been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. The father argued that the order should be changed because the oldest daughter at least wishes it to be changed and because she is a mature and thoughtful child for her age. The mother argued that there was concern from the assessor that at least the oldest child may be expressing wishes and desires that may not necessarily be hers but may be made by her in an attempt to express the mother's wishes or desires. HELD: 1)The court dismissed the application. As no change was demonstrated, it was dismissed with costs. 2)There was no evidence that at the time the court asked to change the child support order, as the mother in her affidavit material confirmed that she had commenced as of June 2007, to pay support based on her new income and as there was agreement between the parties, each from their own affidavit material, that that current support level should be $619 per month. There was no information before the court to suggest that this was no longer in the best interests of the children."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant sued the defendant for breaching a contract whereby the defendant agreed to custom seed some 1,050 acres for the plaintiff in exchange for a fixed price of $19,293.75. The defendant argued that the trial judge was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and had improperly interfered with the plaintiff's cross-examination of Knudsen's witnesses. The appeal judge rejected both lines of argument. He found that the judge's findings of fact had been reasonable and that trial judge had managed the trial fairly, patiently and efficiently. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant. There are some issues which could be issues of law but they are all so lacking in merit as to warrant the attention of the Court. 2)The defendant has a catalogue of complaints about the Queen's Bench. The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged the plaintiff from asking the same question multiple times. 3)The trial judge's language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant sought an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike the affidavits of Sonya Lorette, dated January 22nd, 2007 and February 9th, 2007. The issue was procedural, it was being argued that the reception of the two affidavits into evidence would be inappropriate and contrary to case precedent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The issues were procedural. 2)The applicant had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied. After making that request there was a procedural breakdown between the Council and the Board with respect to how that hearing would proceed, with the Board seeking and being denied, an adjournment. The hearing then was held as scheduled without the participation of the Board. The affidavits were admissable to complete the records. The fairness of doing so was underscored by the fact that on the hearing of the board's application the court will have before it the affidavit of Merks which is to much the same effect as the one raised in Waverley. 3)The issue was whether affidavit evidence is admissible on an application for certiorari."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found that both parties had breached the contract and that the breach entitled the defendant to terminate the contract without notice. The defendant counterclaimed in negligent misstatement and breach of contract, and the trial judge awarded $270,307.05 to the appellant. The appellant argued that the defendant breached its contract by failing to provide the approximate tonnages and that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion of liability provisions in the contract. The court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss of profit and awarded $10,000 damages to Roper. Roper's appeal was directed primarily at the findings of fact. However, the judge did not make any reviewable error with respect to the facts. As for the plaintiff's damages, he dismissed all of them."

The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. Their grounds are that the respondent has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will he is presently an executor and he is refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1)The Court has the jurisdiction to remove an estate executor pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act.  2)The respondent is removed as an executrator in the grant of probate ordered by Gabrielson J. on July 20, 2016 and that Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall continue as executors pursuant to that grant.  3)There is no evidence before the Court that either of Kent or Rodney have acted contrary to their obligations to administer, the estate in accordance with the directions. Further, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly do their duty."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","FIAT: The plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs of $1,598.50. The defendant held funds seized under the enforcement proceedings following the entering of the default judgment, Sollows' counsel undertakes to request the Sheriff to continue to hold those funds pending a further order of the Court. HELD: The default judgment was set aside on the basis that the defendant had entered a judgment that was greater than the amount due. The plaintiff was entitled to apply to set aside that default judgment and seek leave to file a defence in the form of the draft filed with the court July 19, 2018. 1)The plaintiff failed to demonstrate an arguable defence to the claim. The time frame from March 22, 2016 to March 15, 2018 is a total of 723 days, not 725 days. 2)The time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollow's was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after it was entered, this delay in defending might constitute sufficient reason to deny the application. 3)The logic and the law relating to ostensible authority cannot supplant this clear statutory direction as to how and when band councillors are entitled to make decisions. To permit majority of Council to bind the Band on the principle of ostensible power when they have made a decision outside of Council meeting would be permitting a common law principle of contract law to supplant the express direction of Parliament."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as result of seizure of marijuana plants, the respondents alleged that their Charter rights under s. 8, to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure, had been violated. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The admission of the evidence would not affect the fairness of the trial. The evidence was excluded because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. The warrantless search was unreasonable. 2)The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S. 347 when it interpreted the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as providing protection 'of people, not places'. The court found that the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation that the evidence should be excluded because the search was conducted in an area accessible to the public. It is not necessary to determine if the searches were unreasonable and if so, whether the evidence warranted exclusion. 3)The trial judge placed the onus on the Crown to prove the accused were not acting in good faith because they relied on the apparent statutory authority in s. 10 of the narcotic control act and they had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that there were narcotics at the place searched."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at the residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The accused argued that the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict because the date of the offence was not proven, there was an error of law. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. 2)The evidence presented by the Crown was not sufficient to meet the required test, that is, whether there was any evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. 3)Given the circumstances in which the motion was made, including the argument advanced by defence counsel, it is fairly obvious that the defendant had failed to prove that the day of possession of the weapons was May 30, 2003 as alleged in the Information. However, in preliminary discussions with the judge, defence counsel agreed that the Crown must prove all the essential elements. The Crown need not prove elements which are, at most, incidental to the offence. The date of these offences was not an essential element."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The petitioner sought a divorce from the respondent as well as maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married for 10 years and had two children. The petitioner sought custody of the child. The respondent sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits. HELD: The Court granted the divorce on the grounds that the separation agreement was not in effect for a specified period of time and the petitioner was entitled to reasonable access upon reasonable notice.

The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the finding of inordinate and inexcusable delay. The defendant sought an order returning $40,000.00 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid and retained by the latter to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. HELD: The application for dismissal was granted. 1)The delay in advancing the action does not constitute an inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. 2)The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim does not reach the level of'serious prejudice' having regard to the factors considered in the ICC case. 3)The defendant was not entitled to recover the costs of its action."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues which were summarized as follows: 1) Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. He was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2) The Court found the accused was 'in care' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(1)(a). The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care and control of the vehicle. The Court concluded that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The accused failed to demonstrate his s.10(b)(c) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. The court held that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures, including head and neck trauma procedures. 4) The court concluded that there might not well exist circumstances, for instance, in which the accused might not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to a lawyer."

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The onus was on the accused to show cause why his detention was not justified pursuant to s. 520(7)(d) of the Criminal Code.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s. 63 of The Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the ""Group Plan"") is not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The loan agreement creates a significant security interest in favour of Crown Life and the applicant. The provisions of s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply. 2)The taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes the provisions of the Plan Contract; and 3)the contravention of Article 8.03 renders the Loan Agreement illegal and unenforceable."

The parents separated in October of 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move with the respondent from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. HELD: 1) The child's primary residence is with his mother so long as she remains in the City of Saskatoon. If she chooses to relocate, the petitioner will become an access parent and the children will no longer benefit from his co-parenting. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton the child is not in the best interests of the child.

Is it in the children's best interests to relocate to Edmonton? 2) What is an appropriate access schedule for Harley to be with?  3) The children's law act s.6(5) mandates that a child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with the best interest of his or her child and, for that purpose, what is the ideal access schedule.

e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act permanently committing the three children of the Department to the Minister. Since the birth of the oldest child, the Department had been very much involved. The decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The Department had struggled for six years to overcome the dysfunction in this family and the risks to the children, without success. The children had been and accordingly continue to be in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act. The violence and disharmony was another symptom of being unable or unwilling to provide for the needs of the children."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: Custody was granted to the father with access to the mother. Access was to commence January 1, 1998. The mother was adamant that the custody and access assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. 1) The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. 2) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the children's unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. 3) There were numerous conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There was really very little involving the mother directly. The parties were involved in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and having regard in particular to the age and unwavering antagonism of the two eldest children, the father had made only one voluntary payment of $100 in January, 1998 and otherwise ignored the maintenance order until garnishees were implemented by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. He was to have access on his scheduled days off work. 4) There was no evidence that the father was seeking out disagreement, no matter how trivial. Only by hearing the tapes could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","FIRE: The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operationand operated a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant recommended to the petitioner that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. Relying upon the accountant's advice, the petitioner brothers invested in these partnerships. Over the years, the parties have sustained heavy ongoing losses which have resulted in the need for significant injections of capital contributions to the Partnerships. The petitioner's business losses have always been allocated equally among the partners and claimed by each of the partners as personal business losses on an equal basis. As a result, the defaulting partners have obtained the benefits of the partnership (in the form of reduced income taxes resulting from business losses) without paying for them. HELD: 1)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court to refuse to issue the receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. No adequate explanation has been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven.  2)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. As I am satisfied that he has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they have becomedue. It is common ground that the respondent has paid nothing toward the partnership obligations since 1993. The facts relied upon by the Petitioners to prove indebtedness to them comprise the uncontroverted evidence as to the facts described above.  3)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Bankruptcy Court that the petitioner had committed an act of bankruptcy within 6 months prior to the filing of the petition."

It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. It also held that the court could not vary a final order on an interim basis pursuant to s.17. The Court reviewed the jurisprudence of the past 10 years and found that the courts lack the authority to vary final orders on a matter of jurisdiction, especially when it comes to child support orders."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.",HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of the first count of wilful damage to the car contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The second count was dismissed on the basis that the Crown and defence would be allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information which would all be applied over to the other information.
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the complainant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt as to guilt."

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals the decision of Matheson J. confirming the second decision of a Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did.

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.",HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The chambers judge found that the applicant met the burden placed upon him in step one of the two step test and that there was at least a genuine issue that should be left to be determined at trial.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody with the parties to allow them to deal with service issues. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since December 2012 when the petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z. with primary residence and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time. The parties had been locked out for six months."
b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers for the resale of these crops. To secure the product for resale, Johnson Seeds entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. Johnson Seeds attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: There was a valid contract between the plaintiff Seeds and Johnson Seeds. The contract was signed in May 1993 and both parties considered that there was a binding and legally enforceable contract. In addition to the fax, the plaintiff had used the mail to communicate the offer to Johnson Seeds and it should therefore have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully executed copy of the contract. There was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with Calcutt in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that in his view a contract did exist. This as well was confirmed by the defendant. The defendant agreed to pay for the said seed in one of the following ways: The defendant may charge directly to the Producer any excess cleaning charges arising from delivery of Canaryseed containing in excess of 20% foreign material or other seeds which require special cleaning. There is no doubt in the defendant's testimony about these discussions that the defendant verbally reaffirmed that it was very important that payment be received in early January 1994. This was not written into the contract and the defendant was not sufficiently careful to ensure that this term was there in print at the time he executed it."

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.",HELD: The Court found that the negligence and breach of contract claim was based on the defendant's failure to object to the admission of the videotape re-enactment and the opinions given by the R.C.M.P. analyst to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The Court held that the video evidence was not admissible and that the evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.

The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol. 4) The absence of any reference to alcohol being detected on the breath in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues at least. 5) The officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before the court pursuant to s24(2). 6) There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed."
4_1995canlii6069.txt,"The accused was convicted of assault. He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.' HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

The appellant had not persuaded the appeal court judge that he erred in accepting the evidence of this real and unconscripted evidence, the cassette, would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The error of law required to ground jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal is that of the summary conviction appeal Court judge, not that trial judge.

HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.

The issues were whether all tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing, whether the landlord could give notice of termination of tenancy without any cause, and whether the tenant could refuse to grant an order for possession when there was an outstanding order. HELD: The matter was remitted for rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants. There was no order as to costs.  1) The Landlord must prove it would be just and equitable to grant a writ for possession. 2) The issue of service on Ivy and Richie was never considered by the landlord. 3) There was nothing in the notice of hearing that would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service.  4) The tenant did not appear at the hearing nor did the tenant.  5) The rentalsman erred in his adoption and application of Sturgess v.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that it did not find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act or pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act and that the petitioner had not engaged in blameworthy conduct.

Awarding the plaintiff $21,000 for future pecuniary loss, that his employment opportunities were less now than before the accident and he was entitled to lump sum compensation. No weight was given to the plaintiffs actuarial report since there was no history of income and no evidence of projected income from the family hotel business in which the plaintiff was expected to continue.

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded a lump sum of $41,000 for the damage caused by the hip injury and $1,720 for general damages.  1)The plaintiff did not have a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. 2)The injuries were so severe that the plaintiff was unable to walk for several days at a time. 3)The court found that the injuries were separate and apart from the nonpecunia damage. 4)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff. 5)There was no evidence of the plaintiff's projected future income."

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"A low speed collision occurred in the turning lane at this location. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the driver's side and some denting on the trunk lid of the vehicle. The ultimate disagreement centered on the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with no order as to costs to either party.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced. The scales did not weigh persuasively in favour of either party based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. 2)The physical evidence, taken together with diagrams and photographs, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability in this case because it is, at the end of the day, equivocal – i.e. it could support either version of the events related to the court by the plaintiffs and the defendant respectively. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven. On this basis, as a matter of law, the plaintiff’s claim must be and is hereby dismissed.  4)The court was unable to conclude that either version was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contained an equally rational explanation for what transpired on the date in question."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She emphasized that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the court does not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant, they should also conclude that he was the driver of the Tempo. The appellant argued that, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict reached was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It appears that, at the time of the trial, Mr. Holoboff was not in good physical condition. The jury was alerted to them and were advised that the appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was Mr. Horkoff. 3) The Court was not persuaded that the judge's remarks would have unduly or unreasonably influenced the jury's decision to sentence the appellant to consecutive terms."
9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff, a municipal tax payer, paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the ""due dates"" in 1995 and 1996 inclusive. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination, which translated into the overpayment of taxes. Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the disposition of the appeal. The intention can be gained from the very terms or phrases in s41(i)(i) and the Judicator Act, which only apply where there is a proceeding for the recovery of debt or damages and it is a mischaracterization of the various levels of assessment appeals to suggest they are proceedings for recovery of debts or damages. HELD: There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. The date from which interest is calculated in this action to pursue Canada Trust's right to interest on the amount of the over payment is upon completion of the appeals process. Interest could be claimed under s40(i), supra from the time the tax payments were to be paid until disposition.  1)The Judicator's Act does not create debt. The Judicator has no right to refund of overpaid taxes until the end of any appeal of the assessment. It specifically and expressly requires the municipality to refund the amount overpaid and intentionally makes no mention in this or in any other section to paying interest on that overpayment. An appropriate interest claim does exist under s43(i). It does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the assessment payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded.  2)The date of payment for the refund of tax owing to Canada Trust was the date when it could be said to be a 'overpayment of tax' and the date of the payment of the property tax refund could not be determined until the disposition. 3)Canada Trust was under a direct mandatory statutory obligation, pursuant to ss. 90 and s. 90, supra to refund any amount over paid as soon as the appeal concluded."

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.",HELD: The accused was sentenced to eight years and six months in custody. Credit was given for time spent in custody and a credit of 4 years and 9 months. The global sentence was reduced to 8 years and 6 months. There were two separate schemes which were somewhat complex in their execution and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. The accused pleaded guilty. He had been in custody for two years and eleven months at the time of sentencing and had avoided lengthy trial and the consequent expense. He was given credit of four years and nine months and the global sentence reduced accordingly.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band which held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. The purpose of the Act is not to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that the innocent purchaser is protected provided he had no notice, whether the agreement complies with the Bills of Sale Act or not. 2)The assignment as such transferred to the plaintiff no rights in the choses in action which were recognised at common law. Its efficacy was based solely upon principles of equity, with the additional statutory right given to the assignee to bring action in his own name, instead of that of the assignor, against the debtor upon giving notice to the creditor. 3)The Court was of the opinion that under the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act an agreement which is not evidenced by writing and filed in compliance with section is void even against a party having notice (See Edwards v. Furniture Finance Corp., 1930 CanLII 426). 4)The appeal should be dismissed with costs if only on the simple ground that it was never in the contemplation of the parties to the assignment that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between Fagel and the defendant, should be affected by the subsequent assignment of the book debts."

The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire, the defendant moved to another location. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The plaintiff sought production of all documents relating to the second fire. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court awarded costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. The defendant submits the plaintiff has not established the documents are relevant to the present action. Rule 14.01 displaced the former semblance of relevancy test.

This raises the question as to whether she has sufficient resources to care for these children appropriately. Given all the circumstances of this case, it appears that Wright J. was of the view that the judgment roll 'vacates' the order of the judge.

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.

The Court was advised that the blood samples were subsequently analysed and the Crown would be seeking to have a Certificate of Analyst set out the concentration of alcohol and the accused's buttocks to be situated on the driver's side of the vehicle. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The information contained in the information to Obtain largely consists of boiler-plate. This is to be expected in such documents. The standard of review set out in Garofoli was affirmed in many subsequent cases including R. v. Morelli, [2005] S.C.R. 343. 2.The burden of proof rests upon the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize his blood samples was invalid and that there was an infringement of his rights as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter.  2)There was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant.

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Family Court concerning a lump sum payment made under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges has been varied after payment. The issue before the court was whether such an order could be varied. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court. The general principles favouring the claim must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it. The case Gillis v. Soulis was not determinative of the issue as it did not deal with the issue of whether lump sum payments can be varied under the Family Maintenance Act. There is no power in the courts of Nova Scotia to vary such orders. They are unique creations of a particular statute, and the statute must govern. It is possible to arrive at this conclusion merely by considering the scheme of the Children's Unmarried Parent Act. However any lingering doubt is removed by s34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, is the successor legislation, 'this part shall not apply to any punitive father who has fulfilled the terms of any order made against him with respect to the same child under Part 1'."" 2)The court was unable to cite a case other than Ivey v. Muir in which lump sum orders under the old Children's unmarried parents Act have ever been varied before payment."

HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care. The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT. Both parents want sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy has lived alternating weeks with each parent. Both now say this arrangement does not work very well. HELD: 1)The father's obligation shall commence on the first day of the month following the time that the mother makes herself available for full-time parenting of the child. He earns $2,210 per month ($26,520 per year) and his obligation under the Federal Child SupportGuidelines is $226 per month. The mother asks the father to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for horse riding lessons. The father's proportionalshare of $28 per month is $28. 2)The parties had leave to apply for further directions. There was no order for costs."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and re-assessed her release on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Minister of Defence refused to grant her a pension under s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff filed a civil action based in tort against the Minister on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. 88 of the Liability and Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the authorities to amount to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she is now entitled to a pension. HELD: The plaintiff's proceeding was premature. It was impossible for the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. and s.111. It is inconceivable that the appellant is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time.  1)The Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff has never made an application for pension. 2)The court could not see nothing in the Crown Liability & Proceedings Act or any other statute to which we were referred, which would impose upon the appellant the reverse onus for which the Crown now contends. 3)The Court could not read into the legislation concepts that were both unexpressed and unreasonable."

The vessel was purchased in 1988 and used as a charter vessel in Maine and the Carribean. An assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. The respondent argued that the province can only impose direct taxation within the Province and that temporary presence is not sufficient to raise an assessment under s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without costs. 1)There must be some legislative jurisdiction in the air space above it so that the pivotal question is whether the entry into the province of the aircraft and parts in the course of the operations of the airlines previously described constitutes 'bringing' or'sending' them into province or'receiving delivery' of them there. While would not, in the absence of detailed examination, wish to categorize the Act as being solely intended to impose retail tax payable by the ultimate consumer of the goods, there can be no doubt, as mentioned before, that this is its predominant purpose. The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon, 1943 CanLII 372 (UK JCPC), [1943] D.L.R. (4th) 218 the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether the Act applied to the vessel. 2)The Act applies to the aircraft, parts, equipment and rotary spares (hereafter compendiously referred to as 'aircraft and parts') when used in Canada under a customs permit. No customs or excise tax was paid. 3)The provision applies only to aircraft operations and to sales by the airlines of alcoholic beverages which are served to passengers on such flights after the aircraft is airborne and has achieved cruising speed. 4)Whether the Nova Scotia Tax Review Board erred in law by holding there was not sufficient presence of the yacht 'Sarah Kate' in the Province of Nova Scotia for the application of s. 7(1)."""

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The respondent Board denied the applicant's claim for benefits for the death of her husband on the basis that the deceased had not been found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The applicant applied for judicial review by way of mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, certiorari or to quash the respondent Board's decision.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.

The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.

The officer noted that the vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, it did not stray into the other lane of traffic. 3)The officer testified that the accused had only one beer that date and that when he stopped, he braked abruptly. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their relative reliability, it is not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","This was a child protection proceeding in respect of a child who was under the age of six when taken into care. There was a delay in the proceeding for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns were advanced and alleged that the original agency was planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling for the mother. The trial judge, based on the best interests of the child, extended the statutory deadline for the first disposition hearing and then conducted the trial which gave one of the dispositions authorized by Section 42 of the Act which disposition was to be reviewed within the statutory deadlines. Jurisdiction was lost. The court had not lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. It was only in the rarest of situations that the Court could have made an order after the trial wherein that best interest has been determined if that order would operate beyond any given statutory deadline."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","HELD: The court found that an in dock identification was not the most compelling of evidence. The evidence suggested that the accused was simply scared to make an identification and that the person who had been picked up by the police was the one who had committed the robbery. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference, in the absence of anything else, that Mr. Brooks was just wrong. It was reasonable to conclude that the people found in the car when it was stopped were the people who got in the vehicle when it left."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was quashed. The court found that the defendant had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish their business goals. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement [IDSL); (ii) the Software Customization Agreement [ESMA] and (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (ESMA). These contracts each provided, among other things, that any disputes which could not be resolved by a binding arbitration panel would be settled by binding arbitration. HELD: The application was dismissed. The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators' decision, and the application must be dismissed. 1) The language of the agreements, in particular, is so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and the finality of the arbitrator's decision, that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clause of the Agreement is clear, and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. 2) The agreements in place by HAL and SURTek do not provide for a right to appeal on a question of law. The agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. It does not permit the application of a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators’ decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. The scope of appeals permitted by arbitration legislation is narrow, because arbitration is intended to be a complete alternate dispute resolution mechanism, rather than simply an extra layer of litigation. 3) There are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. The question is whether s45(2)(a) permits the application, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements. HAL takes the position that this section provides the ability to obtain leave for cause. The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that 'go without saying' and are necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction. 4) There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of the meaning of the word 'final"

She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when she was hit by a tractor-trailer. She alleged that when the defendant passed her vehicle, a piece of metal came off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her car, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is now well established law that the applicant for summary judgment must meet a threshold test and establish that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to the facts. Once the applicant has succeeded in meeting this test the respondent must then establish that his or her claim is one with real chance of success. 2)The claim in the tort of negligence can only succeed if the plaintiff can show that the defendant owed her duty of care, that he should have observed a standard of care in meeting his duty, and that his breach of duty caused the damage or injury to the plaintiff. 3)There must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a determination of credibility.  4)The plaintiff failed to show that this claim had a genuine chance to succeed."

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her numerous times on her vagina and breasts. In all cases the touching was over top of her clothing. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The complainant was not convinced of the accused’s guilt. She was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in the acts described in the allegations. 2)There was no evidence to support expert testimony. The complainant was convinced the accused was guilty of all of the offences. 3)The evidence of expert testimony was not supported by the evidence. The following evidence would have confirmed the evidence if it had been supported by expert testimony:

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement. The father was the primary caretaker and the mother the primary caregiver. The mother sought joint custody and primary care with the father. The parties had lived together for a very short period of time and there had been significant changes in the children's lives. The Father was to pay child support of $502 per month. The Mother was to seek a reduction in the father's pension benefits. HELD: The court found that the information provided by the mother and her witnesses was credible and that the father was prepared to acknowledge the mother's involvement in parenting. There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The court was not prepared to modify the child support amount where, considering the financial realities of the parents, it would lead to significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they moved from one household to the other."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The Crown opposed release on the grounds that the appellant was a flight risk. The appellant had no prior criminal record, substantial assets, favourable pre-sentence report and had been on bail for 16 months without incident. He proposed that he be released on an undertaking to appear. He alleged the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant's condominium and failed to grant remedy as result. He also argued that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He argued that the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. He contended that his release was necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate. The court ordered the appellant released on a recognizance in the amount of $25,000 with the following conditions: 1) that he surrender his passport. 2) He surrender into custody in accordance with the terms of his release. 3) The Crown did not allege that the grounds of appeal were frivolous. The appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous. It is preferable that no more be said concerning the merits of the appeal."

The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time of their respective legal counsel, as well as retainers with respect to ongoing litigation without such payments violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued February 18, 2010 as Hfx No. 190408 against the defendant judgment debtors to the plaintiff herein, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order which accompanied the notice in the matter of costs. The defendant motion was denied. The Court could only rely upon the affidavit evidence of Ms. Cochrane relating to the third party loans. The affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans came from or if they will reduce the exigible assets of the defendants, available for execution."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was granted.  1)It was obvious that the accused was not entitled to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make. It may be that fairness requires the accused be given some latitude at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial. Otherwise, the Crown and the court are entitled to proceed on the basis that no Charter issue is involved in the case.  2)The court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. The court found that in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. This is different for trial court which hears cases that have been through preliminary inquiry and detailed pretrial, and that regularly assigns trial judges to cases well before the date of trial. 3)In Provincial Court, it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclude is made. This common sense proposition is equally applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence. In a situation where an accused is trying to establish that a constitutionally protected right has been breached, the court ought to give counsel more leeway in cross-examination of the defence's own witness than is ordinarily done."

Although the applicant claimed spousal maintenance in her petition, her counsel indicated she was willing to withdraw her claim if she is awarded an equal share of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent attended the trial without counsel.

A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provides for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The father works for CN Rail as a railway conductor. He is away from home between seven and sixteen nights month, depending upon the runs he is assigned. Problems with transportation eventually lead to Michael spending most of his time at his grandmother's house. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment on the east side, to accommodate what he understood to be Michael's interest in moving in with him and Jerrilyn, Michael's older sister. Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. HELD: 1)The parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 2)The mother was responsible for the father's portion of the child support. 3)The father did not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9.

e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count. The learned judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the central Crown witness as this witness provided exculpatory evidence. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not adduced as evidence of impairment unless an accused has been informed of his right to counsel, the learned judge based his decision upon the evidence that the accused had bloodshot red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. 3)The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility by being able to observe the witness at the time of testimony and compare their observations to the testimony of other witnesses. 4)The appellant was acquitted of a second charge of operating a motor Vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to the Criminal code.

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for just cause.  1) Summary dismissal is warranted for serious misconduct or breaches of fundamental nature that contravene clear and unequivocal policies, procedures or instructions well known to the employee. Where dismissal is for repeated instances of incompetence or unsatisfactory job performance the employers must show that the employer has established reasonable objective standards of performance; the employee has failed to meet those standards; the employer must establish that the employee failed to mitigate her loss. 2) In this case, the plaintiff made a reasonable effort to maintain employment and was dismissed summarily without notice."

The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an “oppression remedy” to the counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The judge granted leave to the appellants to commence derivative action against the defendants for alleged breaches of their fiduciary rights. The appellants applied for leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order in allowing the appellant to amend his defence to withdraw his admissions. There was no temporal connection between the appellant's shareholding and the impugned acts of oppression and the appellant could not be represented by the counsel of their choice."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code, Justice Cromwell issued a written decision granting the release with conditions pending the appellant's appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. The Crown applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code. HELD: The appeal was set aside and the matter returned to the Court of Appeal. The court of appeal ordered that the matter be heard by a panel of judges. It was not ordered to hear the application for judicial interim release under s679 but rather that the chambers judge erred in law in ruling the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that the appellant was not in custody, therefore, the court misinterpreted the definition of custody."
2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of care and custody with no provision for access with respect to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father was residing with the mother and providing care at the time the child was apprehended. He was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of the Child Protection Act and was considered a party to the proceeding. HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody subject to the terms and conditions of the protection finding. She was to have unscheduled access to the agency and the agency with a list of babysitters, all pets be removed from the residence, restrictions on who could reside in the home with the child, instruction from family support worker on child care safety issues and couple counselling if the child were to develop a relationship with the biological father. The child was to be placed in temporary foster care for two years. The agency was concerned that the mother was not prepared to cooperate with the agency in addressing the risk factors which affected the health and safety of their child and were more concerned about their own circumstances than the child's needs."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to sections 253(b), 253(a) and s. 253(p). He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant waived part of it such that the remainder was not unreasonable. 3)The court was asked to infer prejudice on the basis that the length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the legislation was enacted.  4)There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as result of unreasonable delays in their trial."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting a summary judgment on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge committed no error in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries to the defendant. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, s. 62(1) and s. 2(ak). The plaintiff argued that the lease agreement fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner' and that the insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal. The appellants argued that s.62 can be applied so as to impose liability in circumstances such as the one described in Gordon Capital where the plaintiff's claim for vicarious liability against the insurer had a different result. The issue before the Chambers judge was whether the chambers judge correctly cited the test and whether he erred in his application. The court concluded that the issue of whether liability should lie against the employer, rather than obscuring the decision beneath semantic discussions of'scope of employment' and'mode of conduct', was one of the issues to be addressed."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. The trial judge awarded the mother custody of the parties' son to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the regular school year and for one half of major school breaks, with each party to share and assist in the transportation of their son for the purposes of access. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. HELD: The application was granted. 1)It is not possible to conclude that the child can be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time that Mackenzie was essentially abandoned by both parents until he was 10 or 11 years old, both of his grandparents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia. The person who is convinced that Clifton will accommodate Danita's access in the future should he be granted custody, irrespective of his financial situation, is the parent who is better able to understand and facilitate this need in the best interests of the child. 2)Given the facts of this matter, I can foresee no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay is lifted. Given the unfortunate circumstances of Mackenzie to this point, it is imperative that the boy be provided the opportunity to have regular and consistent contact with both his parents. The incentive on the father to perfect his appeal should he still wish to do so is the incentive on him to improve his appeal."

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application by a mother for variation of the judgment in which the father gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born in 1990 and 1986.

The mother applied to vary the judgment by granting mother sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with the father.

The alternative being requested is to move to a completely new community away from extended family and friends. 2)The father's move was not in the best interests of the children since there was no dispute about this since 1990 and indeed friends and neighbours from Melfort filed affidavits stating how much they enjoyed their visits with their mother and how they fitted in with the people of that town and environs, and he has, in addition offeredgenerous access."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They also opposed the certification on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The representative plaintiff applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, s. 491 and Rule 49 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173C application. They raised the following grounds: 4(a) the chambers judge erred in law in failing to find that the full extent of the conversations between the plaintiff and the class members (collectively the 'Respondent') and McMillan did not fall within a category within which existing precedent recognizes a duty to a lawyer to a client; and 5(b) there was no conflict between the affidavits of the Respondent and the respondents and no reason to entertain the supposition that the evidence at trial would be different; and 6(d) the test of policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty on them were essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim.

Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag.

The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. 2)The police must have one of the purposes for a valid search incident to arrest in mind when the search is conducted. Further, the officer's belief that this purpose will be served by the search must be reasonable one. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, it was of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a firearm contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with intent to sell. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. The evidence led by the Crown established that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms and ammunition. The intercepts were also of crucial importance to the firearms trafficking charges. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the interest resided. 2)There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. Reasonable doubt was based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof."
6_2014skqb59.txt,"Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010. She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: The petitioner commenced this family law proceeding by issuing a petition in which she sought divorce and equal division of the family property estate. The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.). Specifically, she did not claim for spousal support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The court found ample authority for the proposition that retroactive support should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application.  2)The respondent was 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The respondent argues that he cannot keep up the pace of working overtime hours as he did in previous years. In assessing support, whether child support or spousa support, the court does not compel a payor to work overtime. The evidence establishes that the respondent's gross income in the year 2013, to his pay period ending December 14, 2013, was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income. [3] The respondent is 61 year old. He earns rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income, after payment of property taxes, yields $8,000 to the respondent. Given his age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. An application to amend the petition, amongst other relief sought, was consented to by the parties on October 17, 2013 and granted October 22, 2013. [4]The petitioner was awarded costs of $1,200.00 payable by the father.  5)The Court found that the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes was $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory support is appropriate.  6)The petitioner is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540 per annum."

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts donot have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the respondent.  1)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. 2)The court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to s.15(1)(b). The court could not find jurisdiction under the Divorce Act as the child was clearly resident in Saskatchewan for the purposes of The Children's Law Act. 3)The Court had jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction under ss.15 and 1. The court was directed to set an early pre-trial conference date.
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The accused was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was also charged with impaired driving. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused's mental state during the time the police officer assumed some control over his situation, imposed upon him the obligations arising from s. 254(3) and (5)of the Code, and read him his s. 10 Charter rights. 2)The officer gave him an honest and reasonable understanding of facts sufficient to constitute proper grounds for a blood demand.  3)There was no evidence of lack of appreciation of the right to counsel. The officer's observations and contradictory evidence of other witnesses was not sufficient to determine whether the officer's belief was real and reasonable. 4)The court concluded that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of each of the following: the reason for the police's attendance at the hospital, (b) the demand, (c) the opportunity which was being given to him to consult with lawyer and (d) that what was being sought, the blood samples related to impaired driving and would put him in legal jeopardy. 5)The police officer's assessment of the accused's ability to comprehend and appreciate the rights of a person who is clearly and fully informed of their rights at the outset, and the standard caution given to detainees was as instructive and clear as possible."

The application is made pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990. HELD: Leave is given to the respondents to take further proceedings against the applicant. 1)The purpose of s. 53(1) of the Legal Profession act, 1990 is to provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with a decision of the Hearing Committee within 45 days so that disciplinary matters against its members may be dealt with in timely manner. The process must be completed without undue delay and thus protect the member's interest. 2)The applicant is a paid-up practising member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, the applicant was granted an inactive membership. He applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave was denied on May 22, 1997. The respondents conceded that no action was taken with respect to the sentencing of the applicant between August 9, 1995 and May 30, 1997 and that they were advised that it would be inappropriate for them to proceed in the face of a challenge to its jurisdiction. The applicant was convicted of one count of theft and two counts of fraud and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation to the victims of his crimes. The Hearing Committee did not have jurisdiction to proceed further against him."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 2)The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on a prosecution of April 8th events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on that date. If this were to be a trial by jury, severance on that basis would be appropriate because of the risk of propensity reasoning by the trier of fact. There is no such risk in having all the counts tried together and further delay would thereby be avoided while he is in custody. 3)Sellance is required in the interest of justice, as per s. 591(3) of the Code. The interests encompass a multiplicity of offences having little legal or factual nexus. The issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and there is no common evidence. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. It is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8 and April 14th but not in respect of the April 15th events. The court may, where it is satisfied, order the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts. 4)While an accused's stated and objectively justifiable intention to testify on some but not all counts is not necessarily determinative of a severance application, it can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests require a joint trial"

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation in the form of damages from the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not, in my opinion, a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. The title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other. The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v.

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and the child shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is that the child has a strong bond with both parents and Lesly's support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. Costs in the cause. 1) There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 2) Lesly had chosen to relocate to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly. She applied as primary parent. She was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing the child and shared other parenting duties. The issue of mobility was clearly unresolved. 3) The respondent was to pay to Lesly for each occasion that the mother travelled to Victoria. She had made choices which resulted in greater expense to insure that the kaira sees both parents. Accordingly, the cost of transporting the child to and from Victoria shall be borne primarily by Lesly and the petitioner. The petitioner was to provide telephone access to the child every second day at 7:00 p.m. Regina time during Lesly’s parenting time and 7:30 a.m Victoria time during her parenting time. 4) Costs to the cause were to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 1996 CanLII 191 (4th) 321, which are well known and which are germane to the case. 5) The status quo was the attachment the child had with the primary parents and that is Lesly but there was a compelling reason for the status quo to be maintained unless there were compelling reasons not to do so."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent while the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while LM. requested the continued intervention of the Agency. During summations, the Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child C.B., but sought the termination of its involvement with K.B. The Agency did not participate at the disposition review, although it had participated in previous hearings. HELD: The court found that the information concerning the children was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency as the documents contained historical references only and related, not to the Agency, but rather to the common law partner. The court ordered an order dismissing the Nova Scotia proceedings."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and she assumed her position in 1999. She testified that she met the accused in the office of the Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court concluded that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. The Court found that the Court believed that allowing the Crown to use the statement to cross-examine the accused was tantamount to allowing the accused to enter the statement as evidence and, in that manner, to allow the Court to split its case."

The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.

The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. If costs are sought shall hear counsel. He is entitled to relief under Subsection 178 of the BIA.  1)The applicant has and will continue to experience financial difficulty to such an extent that he will be unable to pay his liabilities under the student loan. 2)He has a monthly surplus of $170.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.",HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered the trial to be held in Unified Family Court. The Court found that the information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when the information was given.

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. HELD: The certification application was dismissed with the court finding that all of the specific allegations as contained in the amended statement of claim were true. The test to be applied in certification applications is whether or not it is plain and obvious that the applicant's claim does not disclose cause of action.

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.

In the matter before me, the father was unable to make a child support order because the mother did not file enough evidence regarding her circumstances.

The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class. It is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted on October 23, 2002, of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. He appealed the conviction. HELD: The appeal was set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; (i) believing in the existence of photographs enhanced the credibility of the complainant; (ii) the trial judge misapplied the test in determining credibility; and (iii) he failed to apply the appropriate test for a prima facie case of assault. 2)The court found that there were photographs to corroborate the complainant's testimony relating to her injuries. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone. 3)The appellant's testimony when he stated that he did not cause injuries in forcing the complainant to return to the truck did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. Where it varies from the evidence of the accused on these points, do accept the evidence in preference to his evidence. The appellant denied that injuries suffered by the complainant resulted from the manner in which he returned the vehicle. He explained how the complainant could have injured herself when attempting to kick him while they were both seated on the ground. The only evidence presented relating to the defence was that he used force only to protect the complainant from the natural hazards that existed in that location at night. There were no injuries."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant places in issue whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injury suffered by plaintiff. 2)The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. These findings leave only the third of the four ""Maxay"" principles to be addressed. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on her floor of the store. However, some of the injuries appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 4)The plaintiff did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where she fell although it does not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.",The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The essential facts were not in dispute. 2) The respondent was only looking after the child for a couple of hours as opposed to the respondent who was raising four children with developmental and health problems and severe problems of her own. The respondent refused to seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. She did not seek the support of her spouse but the fact that both parents were more concerned about their drug habits than they were about facing the challenges of looking after their children. 3) The sentence imposed was in the low end of the range because of the personal circumstances of the accused. The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offence. The trial judge failed to give adequate weight to both the seriousness and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to address s. 718.01 of the Code. 4) The court was satisfied the appeal should be allowed on the basis of this latter ground. 5) The sentences were tailored to suit the degree of moral fault of the offender.
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused and the surety. HELD: The application for forfeiture was dismissed. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.

In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,"This was an application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue is whether the Court has discretion to refuse having regard to the provisions of s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The youth court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him. The application is all that has been decided in this case. Nothing in this decision should be read as in any way denigrating or casting doubt on the proposition that young people in this province have the right to counsel. 2)There was no evidence that the young person was unable to obtain counsel through Legal Aid initially. It was clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. The young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge his counsel for whatever reason and repeatedly insist on the appointment of substitute counsel."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The appellant sought payment of $5,855 in full compensation for its interest in the expropriated land for widening the Bedford Highway. The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993 and the effective date was September 8, 1993. The solicitor-client account was taxed in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. The notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act and certificates of readiness were filed by counsel and the Board set the matter down for hearing on November 14, 1994. The appellant appealed the decision of the Taxing Master to reduce the solicitor's account from $20,000 to $10,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs confirmed. 1)The appellant was correct that the failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the appellant's offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 2)There was nothing in the decision to suggest that the taxing Master disallowed any services that were actually incurred. He simply concluded that the services, although actually incurred, were not reasonable in all the circumstances.  3)The taxing master was correct in stating that the initial offer made in an 'expropriation' was an initial offer and not necessarily or likely the final position of the appellant. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such interest and he was correct to put even greater weight upon the expert's report recommending an appropriate fee for the legal services."

The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","The appellant was charged with driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or drug and for refusing a Breathalyzer test. At trial the Provincial Court Judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the demand. That decision was not under appeal. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The findings of the learned trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the SL-2. There is, however, an exception to this rule in which the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict. In such circumstances, depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be another conviction."

d_2013skqb348.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues.","The defendants applied for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant in support of their application for carriage of the proceedings. HELD: The applications were dismissed. The court emphasized the importance of providing on certification motion a proper evidentiary record for resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions were whether the affidavits should be examined for cross-examination by third parties or examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross examination."
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appeals from a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009. The hearing officer declared that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and that the hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order of possession of the rental unit. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. Those circumstances do not exist here and conclude that the Hearing Officer did not err in law in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 2) There was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant was not at fault in this situation. He signed a lease in good faith and did not intend to act for his mother. He was acting for himself and asserting that he had that right. 3) The Hearing Officer erred by declaring that the landlord had not provided the tenant with a written agreement that substantially complies with the provisions of the tenancy agreement.  4) The tenant's obligation to pay rent is suspended if the landlord gives notice without the consent of all joint tenants. 5) The landlord may have remedies against the tenant for any damages he has suffered as a result of his dealings with the tenant. 6) The tenancy agreement is not invalid if the tenant fails to provide the information required of the landlord pursuant to s. 7(f)(i) or s. 8(f) of the Act. 7) It is just and equitable for an order to be made pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Code of Conduct. 8) In any situation where one person has so acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person to act on his or her behalf, and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person, it is in the public interest to hold a hearing.

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.

S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings on Robie Street. These one time family homes have been converted into apartment units. In response the respondent repainted the buildings in a haphazard and multi-coloured fashion. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s.24 of the Charter. If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary. 2)The trial judge made no error in law."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of sexual assault. He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended the evidence on this point by failing to give proper effect to it. The judge's reasons for rejecting the accused's testimony and finding that it did not raise reasonable doubt are based on misappreciation of the trial record. 2) There was no other way in which the appellant's evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The evidence bearing on the appellant’s credibility was highly material to that critical issue. 3) The trial judge failed to give a proper effect. The court was not persuaded that the evidence was substantial, material and essential to the conviction."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed for several years by a classification society with rules and regulations for number of functions including construction and design of vessels and offshore platforms. He was given two days written notice of termination without cause.

He alleged that the agreement did not purport to deal with the plaintiff's termination of employment.

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to child support, the agreement provided that spousals would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner sought to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The parties agreed that Melanie remained a child of the marriage and that an equitable sharing of economic consequences would be achieved. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. The court would proceed to a pre-trial conference and trial if necessary on the question of whether the respondent is obliged to pursue work in his field as a computer consultant and whether to impute income.

The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered a guilty plea to one count of driving while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code.

The Court was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities the accused would not drink and drive again, her conduct over the last 18 months suggested that it was probable she would not. The court ordered the accused to continue attending AA two to three times weekly for the next year at a minimum. She was also ordered to continue contact with a professional addictions counsellor."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child together. The applicant claimed that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that following the settlement she felt the need to settle. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed, that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed and the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and there was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The additional income came from investment income and rental income that she received from a tenant who rents a basement apartment in her home as well as rent from boarder. The household expenses that the applicant claimed in relation to her rental income exceeded the actual rental income and there were no adverse tax consequences to receiving those monies. 2)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. 3)It was not necessary for the court to determine the agreement was unconscionable. The court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 4)The parties had signed an agreement in January 2003 that provided for an approximately equal division of matrimonial assets and debts. The assets received by the applicant exceeded in value the amount of her mortgage but that was offset by the respondent's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused was charged with 56 offences set out in eight Informations. Six of the Informations involve co-accused Osman Hassan Mohamed and/or Faysal Abdi Hassan. Most of the offences are alleged to have taken place in Regina, Saskatchewan on or about June and 7, 2012 and involve such charges as: conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime and possession of a counterfeit mark. HELD: The accused was dismissed from the application for a stay of proceedings. 1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time.  2)The Court dismissed the application to stay proceedings on the basis that the accused did not establish on a case-by-case basis that there was an actual breach of the right to a fair trial within reasonable time as guaranteed by s. 11(b).  3)The court found that the individual rights of the accused must be balanced by the interests of society in law enforcement. 4)The respondent had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of the respondent."

When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue is whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse'. This is what happened. The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence. He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment. On the return date the accused did not show up, so the present charge was laid. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse. 2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was eventually stayed by the Crown."

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the contract between the defendants and the City of Regina.

The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order for production of documents by the defendants. The defendants had refused to produce the documents.

The words'shortfalls' and 'deficiencies' do not add much more. It does not follow that because plaintiff is, upon discovery, given access to documents or information that will, of themselves, constitute admissible evidence.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-Mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving the applicant. The Union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion, the union applied for costs of the strike. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal-mart should be dismissed. The affidavits of the former vice-chairperson and his statement of claim have no value. The affidavit is not sworn and as such is not admissible to prove the accuracy or truth of what they contain. The transcript of the radio broadcast is attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests that he prepared the transcript. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript of that broadcast.  1) There is no necessity for their admission. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. The only documents which are properly before the court on a reasonable apprehension of bias against the applicant are the Leader Post article and an article from the Regina Leader-Post newspaper dated May 11, 2006. 2) The affidavit of Walter Matkowski with 39 exhibits is admissible by reason of s. The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S., c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the Legislative Assembly, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Queen's Printer shall be deemed to be authentic and make proof of their contents without other evidence; That provision enables the extracts to be filed to prove what was said, but not as proof that the remarks were true.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the respondent was not fit to stand trial. It held that the trial judge erred in applying the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence."

Defence now wants further disclosure of information for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an inquiry into the facts that relate to those important issues.

[2] To pursue the fishing analogy so often used in the authorities the court should guard against such quests without a real expectation that the outcome would be the same as that of the investigation in this case.

5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and using a weapon to wit a baseball bat. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence of two years is set aside, and a sentence of 2 years less a day imposed in its place. The probation and all other provisions of the sentence are set aside. The sentencing transcript shows that there was essentially consensus between the Crown and defence as to the sentence that should be imposed.

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.

This offence occurred in a particular circumstances and there was no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor was there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. 2) The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record and he had not previously served time in jail. 3) The court found him to be in good standing with the community."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","The parties entered into a joint venture agreement whereby they sought to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of their Participating Interest at any time during the currency of the agreement, the other Parties hereto having a Participating interest in the Program Lands or Project Area affected (hereafter in this Section 14.01 called the 'Purchasers'). The appellant relied on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than any part of its Participatin Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The words in the parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase 'participating interest' in the program lands or project area did not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant. 2)The phrase 'the parties being absolutely prevented from selling or assigning, transfer or otherwise disposed of any other than all of its participating interest' was used to create a complete right of first refusal. The phrase 'ownership' was not used to refer to a broad definition of ownership, nor did it constitute a right of return."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The affidavit of Ms. Scott showed with precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be. The need for “showing” the amount is obvious; (iii) to require the plaintiff or his/her agent to not merely allege that indebtedness is owing but to formally attest to the existence of it and thereby warrant, not only that claim is genuine, but that it is not provisional or contingent; (iv) to identify some third party (garnishee) who is alleged to owe money to the defendant that can be attached and applied to the payment of indebtedness. 2)The plaintiff's claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to ss.3(1), and if it is for an unpaid judgment or alternatively, a claim for a debt or a demand and not an indebtedness that falls outside those limits. 3)There are four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act as outlined by Bayda in Conexus, supra.

5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent's medical condition and his use of marijuana were no risk to his children. The Court believed that concerns relating to the respondent’s medical condition could be managed if the children continued to have regular access with him. The respondent did not consider that his children expressed any concern about his medical condition, his marijuana use or his driving. As a result of the late filing of documentation and review of the allegations contained in that documentation, the respondent was not able to participate in the settlement conference."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.",The justice of the peace made an order granting Dolgopolfrom exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining him from having contact with his wife or daughter during the course of the appeal of the order.

At the time of its making there was no urgency necessitating any extraordinary action. The order will terminate forthwith.
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a subcontractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

5_2013skpc45.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at this business. The defendant continued to monitor those temperatures at the business even with the dispute. Even with this dispute, Gardon continues to monitor the temperature at the premises. That monitoring is done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. As no alarm notification had been received from the defendant, it is equally possible that the reason no alarm was received by the defendant was that none was generated at the company. HELD: The action was dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. 1) Based on the original contract between the parties (Exhibit P-1), and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the onus was on the defendant to prove on a reasonable basis that the breach of the contract was within their control. It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that resulted in no alarm being received by them on August 14, 2010 and no request for repair was ever received from this business after this incident; and the detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon, ensure that there is no breach of their contractual obligation. 2) The monitoring equipment was installed in the cooler and freezer of the business in January 2006 for the sum of $1,190.26 and was monitored by the plaintiff in the months leading up to that day. The plaintiff submits that there were two temperature probes in the walk-in cooler and the freezer that led to no alarm from the plaintiff on the dates in question and that no freezer alarm was actually received from them on that date. 3) The defendant says that the obvious cause of the fact that no alarm (which am satisfied belonged to and was the responsibility of the plaintiff) either failed perhaps from lack of proper maintenance or was adjusted improperly by someone other than an employee of the defendant. Given the exclusion clause in this contract which am satisfied is enforceable (see Fraser Jewelers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) (Ont. C.A.) the issue becomes whether there was cause beyond the defendant's control which resulted in a failure or a failure of monitoring equipment so it could be reported to"
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT. The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001 to expunge child support arrears that had accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support and that, in the absence of a special circumstance, arrear arreages should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay the child support payable in the amount of $9,000.  1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in basic child support, $249 per month in s. expenses and $2,589 in child support costs. 2) There was no undue hardship to the parties as the respondent was putting money away for his retirement. Almost every dollar that was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him was snatched away from him."
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University. He sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant objected to the Crown calling a witness as he raised issues regarding the wording of the charge set out in the indictment and how it is defined by law. The trial judge did not enter into a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence to give. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay?” HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the evidence was part of the “narrative”, giving context to such events as the appellant’s discussions with the professor prior to the email being sent and the fact that the email was written in such a way as to make it clear that the sender intended the message to be taken seriously in line with the authorities relied upon by the Crown."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused is charged with break and enters of homes and is accused of committing them.

He had been sitting in court listening to the other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected on this basis but he also argued that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. HELD: A stay of proceedings is out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence has been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of Whitecap. However, requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate.

He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the YCJA for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention on the basis of two days for each day spent in detention. The accused will be permanently disabled as a result of the assault. 1)The accused was cooperative with police and provided a statement. While in detention, he remained in detention while three reports were prepared and his family was fearful and will continue to suffer. 2)The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. He expressed remorse in light of comments made at a show cause hearing to the effect that he wished he would have killed the victim. The Crown disagrees but is not in a position to take issue with the accused's allegation. 3)A period of custody is necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court has little confidence that the young person would successfully comply with conditions, if probation alone were imposed, given his history of non-compliance."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal is from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal is allowed on the same basis in respect of the 1997 assessment of a shopping centre in Saskatoon called Market Mall. The issues raised by the appellant in this case respecting the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of Market Mall are exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment dealing with a similar assessment of Midtown Plaza. The same reasoning applies in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. As with all enclosed shopping centres, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for Market Mall as if it had been grouped with all other commercial buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City brought an application to review the assessment. The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, identifying that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brings this application to the City. By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week which has a public holiday. The provisions of the agreement are more favourable to the employee than the Act. HELD: The City's application is allowed and the certificate is amended to show that there are no wages due orowing to Albert Morgan. There will be no order as to costs. 1)Nothing in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act affects any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or custom insofar as it ensures to any employee more favourable conditions, more favourable hours of work or more favourable rate of wages than the hours of labour provided for by the Act or by any other Order or regulation. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue. No holiday means no issue. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (the ""agreement"") it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act pay. Thematerials satisfy the Court that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the City paid Morgan 87 hours of pay over the Act's requirements for hours worked in week containing a holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants were charged with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. The Crown brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant's residence which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine was granted and the evidence obtained at the preliminary inquiry relevant to this application was admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. This should not be considered a usurpation of the trial judge's function. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge."

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345.

They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. For the purposes of the application for admission of new evidence, this question does not matter because the amendments set out in the purported Bylaws 2.1993 do not relate to any issue in this matter.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs brought an action for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs had an investment account with the defendant and claimed that the defendant caused them to suffer losses on investments. The defendant counterclaimed that the delay was caused by the death of the plaintiff's solicitor and the difficulty in locating competent counsel to advance the claim after his death. The defendants counterclaimed damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and professional malpractice. HELD: The application to dismiss the action was dismissed. 1)The delay was not inordinate. It was not inexcusable. The delay was entirely due to the negligence of the defendant solicitor and he was blameless. 2)The defendant acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. 3)There was no evidence to support the claim that the plaintiff was personally to blame for the delay. There was no injustice in his bearing the consequences of his own fault. 4)The court found that given the chronology of events and actions by both sides, the delay is inordinate and it is not inordine. 5)The plaintiff was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it is likely to be seriously prejudiced."

Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act directing that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loans. The Bankrupt filed a Consumer Proposal under the BIA. She successfully completed it on March 4, 2005 and received Certificate of Full Performance dated April 13, 2005. The proposal was administered by the Government of Nova Scotia through the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Debtor Assistance.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24-count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in a usable format. The motion has two separate components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, 'the usable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence have been provided. The issue that has arisen in other cases has been whether the method of disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it is provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of an accused to make an answer and a defence. This is a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. HELD: The disclosure provided is appropriate. It is appropriate to provide hard copies of all the police officers' notebooks dealing with their testimony, if printed, would also be provided to defence counsel in preparation for trial.  1) The nature of disclosure provided by police officers in their notebooks was appropriate. 2) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers’ notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. 3) It appears to me that that day will soon come when the ability to operate personal computers and retrieve data stored on computer disks and related media by means of software programs designed for general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving voluminous amounts of data. It appears that that will be a reasonable request."

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had 67 prior convictions, four of them assaulting peace officers. He had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer when he was 16 years old. HELD: The accused was found guilty of a serious personal injury offence. The Court found that the accused exhibited indifference to his own safety and that, given the accused's past actions, it would appear that he did demonstrate such indifference."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. The police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The breathalyzer certificate was excluded. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent waived that right. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper, the evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. 2) An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee, who has previously asserted the right to counsel, indicates that he has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his rights to reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 3) The holding-off requirement flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded such a warning was required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst Lerat. That being so, the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s rights under the Charter. 4) The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed mind about seeking legal counsel. 5) The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean that the Crown has not been advised of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the co-buyer on the purchase agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11/2001 to November 14/2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The Credit Union claimed the claim of the respondent was enforceable. In the special circumstances the Court declined to order costs of either motion."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner sought continuation of the order and supervised daytime access. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The best interests of the child is not simply the right to be free of demonstrable harm. However, if the allegations are based on speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, then the court should reject them. Any other approach invites abuse. 2) The court was unable to conclude from the evidence that there was anything to be taken from this incident that demonstrates any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence before the court was that the respondent was significantly involved in his daughters’ lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments."

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that he would pay her $3,000 per month which included support for their son Michael as well as her. Since then the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,000. Since the petitioner reduced the support to 1,500, even those were irregular and not on time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $2,000 as noted above without at least consulting with the applicant. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received. 2)The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected each party would receive approximately $30,000 in early June when net proceeds were distributed. 3)There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There is the uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income. There was no evidence asto what she will require if she does go touniversity this fall. There are uncertainty as to what the two children are going to do about future education. 4)The applicant sought interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government which when the petitioner and applicant's current income is taken into account indicates that the respondent should pay the applicant around $ 2,400 per month. 5)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of the maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There were no unknown factors in either party's future economic situation. The respondent's future employment was uncertain. The applicant's income exceeded $80,000 annually but it must be noted that the status of his employment is that he is currently suspended with pay. What is going to happen to his employment situation is up in the air and this factor hangs over all of the issues yet to be settled in these proceedings including this application. Should his pay be suspended for a period of time or his job lost then both parties would be required to reassess their respective positions."

While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward.

The plaintiffs sought to convert the application into an action. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court found that the application was not appropriate for an allegation of 'oppression'. 2) It was not satisfied that the initial application of the plaintiffs should be converted to an action at this time. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the defendant's enforcement application.

HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate.

Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The Health Centre was correct to regard itself as successor employer to both of the institutions which served Eastend. This was undisputed. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the Board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in parallel areas for example, property law, begs the real question. The Board is within the purview of the Board to interpret s. 37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. In the circumstances the Board focused on facts they found to be significant. It does not, however, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate.

7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. HELD: The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. That would include not having either cross-examination of the plaintiffs' witness or to present its own case. The court found that the proper interpretation of s. 219(2)(a) of The Business Corporations Act is that the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The dissolved corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the claim. The plaintiff corporation requested that the affidavit of Marilee Fehr be considered by the Court on its behalf. Ms. Fehr was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than two months have now gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year, the plaintiff purchased the property. The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants. 1) The property was not within her means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The plaintiff was not the only one experiencing problems with her home. The defendant's realtor also misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home and in answers that she gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. They failed to tell her the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. In so doing, it is alleged by the plaintiff that they breached the terms of the PCDS."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The Crown appealed. It argued that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the warrant. The court found that the search warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. The evidence obtained as result of the warrant was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same."

The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.",This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01.

The defendant argued there was an 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. HELD: The application was allowed. The court was satisfied any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here).

The accused was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession of the drug and the other charge was stayed. Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Crown argued that s. 20(4) does not require the accused to prove either beyond reasonable doubt or on balance of probabilities her innocence of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence.

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the appellant father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.",HELD: The Court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The appellants wished to add as ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security. This point was raised before the chambers judge in the Supreme Court and is referred to in his reasons. The amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. Any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor which may result if the amended ground is found to be without merit is not attributable to the fact that the ground is advanced by way of amendment as opposed to having been included in the original notice. There is no suggestion of any prejudice in that sense resulting from the amendment."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge and described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. A conditional sentence would not best deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child pornography. A sentence of 10 months imprisonment would be appropriate."

A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.",HELD: The application was granted and the defendant was ordered to return the claims to the Court of Queen's Bench within two weeks. The court did not issue a summons as requested. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating.

He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.

HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

In the past he had been diagnosed as being of sound mind and able to manage his own affairs. In any event, in 1987 he qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provided his basic income of $580.00 a month. When you factor in the G.S.T. rebate his total monthly income is $630. At present he lives with a friend and buys the food for both of them. This cannot continue indefinitely. There is another source of revenue and that is the farm land which is rented out. He has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. On that amount, the respondent's total annual income would be $23,560. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate payment of $442.00. Any order as contemplated will not jeopardize the welfare of the children."

The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.

e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused are how his actions ought to be characterized. 1) The accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is legally irrelevant whose shanks caused which injuries. 2) The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding a principal to commit an offence; and 3) self-defence is not available to the accused. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. To “aid” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or help the actor. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour."
c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter. It is for this reason and as result of my observations of the accused while he was testifying that prefer the testimony of the officer over that of the police officer where there is discrepancy. 2)The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply a sample as directed by the officer. He gave his evidence in a forthright manner and accepted it without reservation.
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. Allowing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant."
