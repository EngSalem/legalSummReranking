c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.

The process was not an insignificant process, nor was it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of the forest lands. HELD: The court found the defendant guilty of the following: 1) The definition of'manufacture' is extremely broad as it says'means any step taken'. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the defendant to fell, de-limb and deliver the logs to the yard. These steps may not be significant but the process is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The Crown's interpretation creates an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing licence for any processing facility that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. 2) The defendant did not have a Forest Products Management Act (FPMA) licence. The court concluded that the defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. The Court found that the defendants were guilty of violating the FMA. 3) The evidence was tendered by agreement. It was not the end of the matter. The evidence clearly established the defendant had taken steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in log home packages.

It was not difficult to find the evidence on the evidence presented by the forester of P & E Logging, which included cutting the logs specifically for the logging industry. 6) The Court was satisfied the petitioner had a processed facility licence. 7) It is presumed that legislation is not intended to produce absurd consequences.

I have therefore concluded that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. CONCLUSION [29] I therefore find Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and Garry Varga guilty of violating s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.",0.29629629629629634,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue was whether the Crown has shown that Chisums requires such a licence. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. 1) The defendant had already taken steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in the log home packages. The process was not an insignificant process, nor is it process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land. 2) The process utilized by the defendant was more than simply harvesting as it was defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. The Crown's interpretation would create an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing license for any processing of a product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. 3) The Crown failed to show that the defendant requires a processing Facility licence. 4) The evidence was tendered by agreement. 5) The court was satisfied that the petitioner's company was involved in the manufacture of a log home product for the log-home industry. It was not difficult to find the evidence on the evidence presented by the forester of P & E Logging, which included cutting the logs specifically for the logging industry. 6) The Court was satisfied the petitioner had a processed facility licence. 7) It is presumed that legislation is not intended to produce absurd consequences. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. 8) The issue in this case is whether the court has shown the Crown requires a permit.","[1] The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (referred to as “Chisum”) and Garry Varga (referred to as “Varga”) are charged as follows:

Information 37262946: Count 1: between the 7th day of August, 2007 and the 8th day of September, 2007, did operate a processing facility without a licence, contrary to section 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that Chisum requires such a licence. These steps may not be significant but I am satisfied that the process utilized by P & E is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. I am also satisfied that Chisum took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. I find that paragraph 5 of P-1 clearly establishes the steps taken by Chisum, including debarking, were steps taken in the manufacturing of a forest product for market.

The decision of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator of the Department of Justice was taken. The appellant appealed the denial of access to information pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Act. The respondent had been aware of the allegations and was aware that the RCMP had been involved in a number of investigations into institutional abuse in the provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. During the course of the inquiry, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements from former residents of the institutions which outlined certain allegations of institutional abuse. The summary of the alleged abuse was made available to the public and the respondent made undertakings of confidentiality to the individuals who gave the statements. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of Community Services became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Justice Minister. 2) The respondent was not the only respondent to be denied access to the information requested. He was also the respondent to the respondent's application for access to a third party's records.  3) In the event the province did not accept a claim method of review was established, the review process did not include an opportunity for persons against whom allegations had been made to respond. 4) In many respects as of December 1996, the ADR process may be considered anew.","[1] This is an appeal by Lee Keating (Keating) pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.5 (the Act).

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.

The evidence did not support the defendant's conclusion that the impact was head-on, but rather that the damage was so severe that it was beyond the range of reasonable doubt that it would have been fatal if the impact had been head on. 3) The court was unable to conclude any contributory negligence as the plaintiff had not been properly trained in the area of the accident, nor was there sufficient evidence to establish a contributory relationship between the defendant and the collision.","Mr. Gibbs is a 46 year old married man.

Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","HELD: The onus was on the defendant to establish negligence on the plaintiff to the extent that the plaintiff's inattention rendered her solely responsible for the accident and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. 1) The defendant was 46 years old and had three previous motor vehicle accidents. The most recent accident occurred at approximately 1:00 a.m. with no interference in visibility, clear, bright sunny day with no precipitation. There was no evidence of any radiation of pain. 2) The evidence was that the defendant had been travelling at a high rate of speed (70 km/hr) when the accident occurred. The defendant had no neck or left knee complaints prior to the accident. The only issue was whether there was a fracture in the driver's side of the vehicle. The evidence did not support the defendant's conclusion that the impact was head-on, but rather that the damage was so severe that it was beyond the range of reasonable doubt that it would have been fatal if the impact had been head on. 3) The court was unable to conclude any contributory negligence as the plaintiff had not been properly trained in the area of the accident, nor was there sufficient evidence to establish a contributory relationship between the defendant and the collision.","Mr. Gibbs is a 46 year old married man. I conclude that Ms. Archibald's inattention, coupled with a probable higher rate of speed than she estimates, renders her solely responsible for this accident, and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. I conclude in this case a reasonable award for the permanent hearing impairment suffered by Mr. Gibbs which will continue to be a source of concern, irritation and aggravation but where there is no evidence that it will lead to a total loss of hearing in his left ear or any acceleration of further loss of hearing in the left ear is the amount of $8,500.00. For past, present, and future limited pain suffering inconvenience interference with the amenities previously enjoyed by Mr. Gibbs I assess damages at $2,500.00. I conclude for nonpecuniary damages under this heading for his past, present and future pain and suffering, loss of amenities, interference with his active lifestyle et cetera a reasonable award of general damages is $31,500.00.

c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has been unable to enforce the writ due to the position taken by Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum. The process of the court has been thwarted. HELD: 1) The solicitor has no right to refuse production and delivery of documents on which he has lien. 2) There is nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the solicitor is not the owner of the shares in question. They are his and his alone. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. 3) Given the totality of what is before me, I do not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been made out.  4) The only claim against his shares within the company is the claim, as creditor. It is as creditor that the plaintiff instructed the sheriff, Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, to make seizure of his shares in Jen-Sim.","[1] ACS seeks an order from this court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex and Canada Life commenced this action. The plaintiff argued that Canada Life acted on appraisals negligently prepared, mishandled the advances on the mortgage and failed to abide by its contract with the plaintiff. HELD: The court found that the plaintiff had waived the privilege by interposing the affirmative defense of good faith reliance on the government's regulations and communications. The documents sought were not privileged. They were found to be in the possession of a former solicitor to the defendants. The examination was to proceed on a question-by-question basis and apparently would be subject to specific objections by the plaintiff's counsel. In this factual situation the waiver may be reasonably inferred.",0.07084468664850135

The plaintiff was not a person insured under the contract but was a cousin of the deceased. She commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It was admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the nervous shock from the Defendant. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident, the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was being defended by the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia.  1)The emotional harm suffered by plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The impossibility of contemplating the extent of the potential liability constitutes a valid reason for not distinguishing emotional damage resulting from such an accident to that of physical harm.  2)The plaintiff's Section Coverage did not extend to her claim.","1.

HELD: The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.  1) Section 139 of the Insurance Act regulates the insurance coverage which is to be provided by insurers licensed to sell automobile insurance in Nova Scotia. Because it is fact of life that loss and injury occurs as the result of the operation of uninsured motor vehicles or drivers, it is not the result that a person insured under the Act would be entitled to recover for mental shock. 2) The Section D provisions of the M/V Insurance policy issued by Wawanesa extend to protect the Plaintiff, who suffered a psychic injury as a result of a 'injury or death' of Jonathan Hartling, an 'insured person' under the policy?  3) It is instructive and in keeping with the case law that claim for damages surviving under the Fatal Injuries Act does not include claim for emotional distress or psychological injury which might result from the loss of a loved one. It is an independent tort and must be founded upon a different basis.  4) The Court concluded that such a result would be impossible for the Plaintiff to conclude.

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.

There is nothing in the evidence which would indicate that the Back-Track September 2006 bill was intended to be an interim bill.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The trial judge held that the police entry and search of the respondent's home were justified. He did not discuss s. 24(2) of the Charter. The evidence heard on that Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. The court found that the respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that there were controlled substances or precursors at the residence and that the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded. The voir dire decision did not breach s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure.,"The appellant was found guilty of several drug offences. Result: Leave to appeal granted, the appeal allowed, and the conviction set aside. In the circumstances, although the call was not a 911 call, or made by the alleged victim or from the home of the appellant, it was reasonable for the police to search for her, to go to the appellant’s home, and not to simply leave once the daughter told them at the door that she was fine. However, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and bedroom, and the search of the home, all without a warrant.

Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed.

Contrary to the terms of the contract it did not construct and deliver to Genex a hog barn that was suitable for the purposes intended.

The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 2) The amount we will pay for compensatory damages is limited as described in SECTION III—LIMITS OF INSURANCE; Exclusions This insurance does not apply to: b. “bodily injury” or “property damage” which occurs during the policy period.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents (Zurich and Sovereign) are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against Westridge and others by Genex Swine Group Inc.

The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against them in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 2) The amount we will pay for compensatory damages is limited as described in SECTION III—LIMITS OF INSURANCE; Exclusions This insurance does not apply to: b. “bodily injury” or “property damage” which occurs during the policy period. The claims for loss of use of other tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from: (i) delay in or lack of performance by or on behalf of the Named Insured after such products or work have been put to use by any person other than an Insured. 3) Occurrence “Occurrence” includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insurer.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect.

The appellant refers to both the reasons given orally at the conclusion of the case, as well as the document entitled 'Supplementary Reasons'. 5)There will be prejudicial effect in the sense of an injury to the case for the Crown if the trier of fact forms an opinion of, or is biased against, the complainant as result of her sexual reputation or as to her sexual activity. 6)There is a presumption that a trial judge, in furnishing the Court of Appeal with a report, must be vigilant to avoid simply expanding upon reasons or rulings previously given or providing reasons where none were given at trial.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752.1 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment pursuant to S. 753.1. It also ordered that he be sentenced to a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offences followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. 1)The Court held that the first application to label someone dangerous offender was accomplished within the application of the criteria in the legislation to the offender's circumstances. The court determined that Parliament, through its amendment, determined that those offenders who fall within the criteria enumerated are, by definition, the worst of the worst and deserving of the dangerous offender designation. This issue is of particular significance to the accused because review of his big picture, including his family circumstances, his employment record, his conviction record and previous sentences, would not obviously label him as the worst kind of criminal society. 2)There was no evidence of violence or threats to others.","[1] On November 9, 2010 after trial, I found the accused, Michael Gamble, guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown then applied to have Mr. Gamble declared a dangerous offender. [17] In my judgment of November 9, 2010 reported as R. v. Gamble, 2010 SKQB 414 (CanLII), 363 Sask. R. 311 (Q.B.), I found that Mr. Gamble stabbed the victim, Wesley Delaronde, several times on the right side of his mid-section with a knife. [18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation. Sentence twelve months custody followed by six months supervision in the community. Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community. [59] The similarities of the violent offences are as follows:
1) He had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time;


2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;
3) While carrying out the violent offences, he used or had in his possession a knife;
4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a) To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
b) To an order under s. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release;",0.16272965879265092,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.

The Crown then applied to have Mr. Gamble declared a dangerous offender. [17] In my judgment of November 9, 2010 reported as R. v. Gamble, 2010 SKQB 414 (CanLII), 363 Sask. R. 311 (Q.B.), I found that Mr. Gamble stabbed the victim, Wesley Delaronde, several times on the right side of his mid-section with a knife. [18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation. Sentence twelve months custody followed by six months supervision in the community. Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community. [59] The similarities of the violent offences are as follows:
1) He had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time;


2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;
3) While carrying out the violent offences, he used or had in his possession a knife;
4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a) To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
b) To an order under s. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release;",0.15926493108728942,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and aggravated assault with a knife. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code. The Court ordered that the accused be remanded for an assessment pursuant to s752. The court found the accused had less active role and he did not smash windows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray.

The court determined that Parliament, through its amendment, determined that those offenders who fall within the criteria enumerated are, by definition, the worst of the worst and deserving of the dangerous offender designation. This issue is of particular significance to the accused because review of his big picture, including his family circumstances, his employment record, his conviction record and previous sentences, would not obviously label him as the worst kind of criminal society. 2)There was no evidence of violence or threats to others.",0.1802575107296137

7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase money security interests in two reefer trailers be given priority over the security interests of the respondent in them. The court found that the respondent did not have constructive possession of the trailers prior to December 19, 1997 when the respondent verbally arranged the acquisition of special equipment from GJ Bell International Ltd. (GJ Bell). The respondent was awarded a security interest in the trailers pursuant to a security agreement granted to it by Lake Air in May 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in January 1998 to specifically include the trailers. The respondent argued that the term 'possession' in these sections is not equivalent to bare physical possession. The issue to be determined is what is meant by the term possession in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of these trailers within the meaning of the priority section. Humboldt was awarded costs from the respondent. Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(1) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which I will discuss later.","[1] Associates applies under s. 63 of The Personal
Property Security Act, 1993 for an order declaring the
priority of competing security interests held by Associates
and Humboldt in two reefer trailers. The Issue [5] The issue to be determined is what is meant by the
term ""possession"" in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in the
circumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession or
constructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of
s. 34(2)(a). [19] In my view, a person is not in constructive
possession of collateral within s. 34(2)(a) unless that person
is a ""debtor"" as defined, unless the collateral is
""collateral"" as defined, and unless another person ""obtained""
physical possession of the collateral ""at the request of ""
that debtor. Such a clause is
inconsistent with the submission that Lake Air had actual or
constructive possession at an earlier date. [22] I also conclude that Lake Air did not have

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","HELD: The Court accepted the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. It found that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The Court also accepted the respondent’s statement that he was not prepared to accept the $625,000 bid on the subject quarters. The court also held that the respondent was not responsible for verifying the bid or for ensuring the deal closed.","[34] The court must determine whether a contract was created between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola respecting the Subject Quarters. Looking to the words exchanged and the context of the bidding process following Mr. Petrie’s conversation with Jennifer Petrie, the court finds that a misunderstanding could readily and objectively characterize the nature of the telephone conversations so that no consensus ad idem was ever reached between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola. Conclusion [58] Mr. Ziola has not established on a balance of probabilities that he and Mr. Petrie were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale respecting the Subject Quarters.

The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.",HELD: The Court held that it could not determine whether a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the subject quarters. The Court found that the respondent had not made any errors in his bid and that the offer was in writing. The court also held that there was no evidence of a breach of the contract.

The court also held that the respondent had not shown sufficient interest in living independently with his partner. The respondent argued that the court had jurisdiction to determine the period for which retroactive support if any will be calculated for the younger child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Section (1) of the Divorce Act provides that a child is a dependent child of a marriage when there is a material change in circumstances. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. However, an oral decision was delivered October 2, 2009 and addressed the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retroactive parent support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution Mr. Munro must make to section expenses. HELD: 1) The Court held that jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child was prerequisite. 2) The court did not consider the issue of the respondent's application for a variation of child support and a readjustment of claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties’ older child, nor did it consider the alternative issue of recalculation of all child support. The Court found that it will not always be possible for court to enforce an unfulfilled child support obligation. There is no attempt to distinguish between basic table amounts and s. expenses. 3) The respondent’s evidence on the matter was speculative and conjecture. 4) It was clear from the various authorities cited by the court that courts recognize jurisdiction under s. 2(1) to hold parents responsible for children over sixteen during their period of dependency. The evidence establishes that the child wrote his last exam at Queens University on April 19, 2008. On April 25, 2008 he and his girlfriend took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The lease is dated April 23, 2008 and had term of 15 months, requiring the parties to pay $1,575 as rent each month.

The respondent argued that the court had jurisdiction to determine the period for which retroactive support if any will be calculated for the younger child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Section (1) of the Divorce Act provides that a child is a dependent child of a marriage when there is a material change in circumstances. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. However, an oral decision was delivered October 2, 2009 and addressed the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retroactive parent support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution Mr. Munro must make to section expenses. HELD: 1) The Court held that jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child was prerequisite. 2) The court did not consider the issue of the respondent's application for a variation of child support and a readjustment of claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties’ older child, nor did it consider the alternative issue of recalculation of all child support. The Court found that it will not always be possible for court to enforce an unfulfilled child support obligation. There is no attempt to distinguish between basic table amounts and s. expenses. 3) The respondent’s evidence on the matter was speculative and conjecture. 4) It was clear from the various authorities cited by the court that courts recognize jurisdiction under s. 2(1) to hold parents responsible for children over sixteen during their period of dependency. The evidence establishes that the child wrote his last exam at Queens University on April 19, 2008. On April 25, 2008 he and his girlfriend took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The lease is dated April 23, 2008 and had term of 15 months, requiring the parties to pay $1,575 as rent each month. As a consequence the recalculation should be three years prior to July 2004 i.e. to 2001. 5) Although originally scheduled for argument on May 20, 2009, the judge did not hear the preliminary motion until August 19, 2009. He allowed for a different result where the respondent was guilty of blameworthy conduct.","He argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. On April 25, 2008 he and his girlfriend/common law partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. [13] The subject child commenced full-time employment on May 12, 2008 earning a starting salary of $25,000 plus commissions and benefits. [19] I am satisfied the court does not have jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties’ older child. As a consequence the recalculation should be three years prior to July 2004 i.e. to 2001. I am satisfied that Mr. Munro did not engage in blameworthy conduct during this period. On the unusual facts of this case I have concluded that communication that represented effective notice in 2004 was voided by the delays of the recipient parent and her failure to prosecute the matter. In my view, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of Mr. Munro, given the passage of several years since effective notice was first received; the significant level of support he was providing; his reasonable belief that he was meeting his obligations; the efforts he made to determine Ms. Niles claim, to respond to it and to settle it. Conclusion [75] In light of the foregoing conclusion on the issue of blameworthy conduct, the appropriate period of retroactive reassessment should be three years before formal notice, this being the maximum recommended retroactive period absent , in this case, blameworthy conduct.",0.267425320056899,"HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to grant retroactive child support or s.7 expenses for the parties' older child.

7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","Dr. Pearlman was enrolled in an orthopedic surgery residency program at the University of Saskatchewan as of September 1997. He was suspended in March 2000. Since then, there have been a number of legal proceedings between the College of Medicine and the University, both internally and externally. In September 2004, an appeal committee of the University recommended that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency program on probationary terms. This decision was not yet implemented. In May 2005, the College requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: The College's secondary concerns for not considering an exception to the policy on the facts in this case are identified as concerns for possible breaches of provincial labour standard laws, or Immigration Canada requirements. The applicant should not have accepted the continuation of his salary during the period of his suspension. Raising these issues as an impediment to the implementation of the appeal committee decision reflects an extreme level of self-interest on the part of the College, without any recognition for the interests of the applicant who had no control over the College's decision, which was agreed to by the College and PAIRS, and breaching provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The College considers this condition necessary to maintain the integrity of its supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies and potential financial implications for itself if it should make an exception.","[2] At issue in this matter is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed the damages at $25,000. The parties to the grievance argued that the trial judge erred by failing to find that the publications were protected by absolute privilege. The court found that the words were capable of bearing defamatory meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted were more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271). [2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000. [48] Based on my review of the authorities, I conclude that the trial judge did not give sufficient effect to: (i) the wording of the defamatory expressions; (ii) the circumstances under which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; (iii) the persons to whom the words were published; and (iv) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to that specific occasion.  In any event, I am satisfied that in the whole of the circumstances, which I have reviewed extensively in connection with the Respondents’ claim for qualified privilege, $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of the damages in this case. [82] Having regard for the same factors that caused me to conclude that $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of general damages, including what was said, how it was published and the effect on Dr. Rubin, I conclude that general damages should be fixed in this case at $100,000. In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin. [85] Having regard for all of the above facts and factors, I have concluded that an award of $100,000 provides sufficient compensation and appropriately balances the positions of the parties.

with respect to the issue raised in the cross-appeal, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to dismiss it without costs.",0.20031796502384738,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.

The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271). [2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000. [48] Based on my review of the authorities, I conclude that the trial judge did not give sufficient effect to: (i) the wording of the defamatory expressions; (ii) the circumstances under which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; (iii) the persons to whom the words were published; and (iv) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to that specific occasion.  In any event, I am satisfied that in the whole of the circumstances, which I have reviewed extensively in connection with the Respondents’ claim for qualified privilege, $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of the damages in this case. [82] Having regard for the same factors that caused me to conclude that $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of general damages, including what was said, how it was published and the effect on Dr. Rubin, I conclude that general damages should be fixed in this case at $100,000. In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin. [85] Having regard for all of the above facts and factors, I have concluded that an award of $100,000 provides sufficient compensation and appropriately balances the positions of the parties.

e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact the City Assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the interest in a shopping mall as required by the Assessment Manual. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property and did not include any non-realty items. The assessment was made on the basis of the sale of three shopping malls, one located in the City of Regina and one in the Town of Normanview Mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. The appellant company appealed its 2003 assessment under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89 c.C.11. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The assessment of the Normanview mall was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. It was not open to either the Board of Revision or the Committee to have regard for the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information. 2)The sale of the mall did not require adjustment pursuant to s.173(5) of The Cities Act. 3)While the Committee sought and obtained information from the parties to the transaction for the three-fold purpose of putting him in position to determine the value of the property, the Committee did not reach the conclusion on the sales of the three malls. Rather, it reached the conclusion that the sale, contrary to what the Committee made of it, did not amount to an arm's length sale because Ontrea was not a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated, and knowledgeable' buyer. 4)The Committee did err in upholding the Committee's conclusions to the effect (a) it relied excessively on sale verification and the information it yielded, ascribing more importance to this information than is warranted by the assessment manual or (c) the Assessment Appeals Committee. It did not find any material error on the part of the Committee regarding the sale. 5)The committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of s.171 and (2) of the Cities Act and its information contained. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties. As for the sales pertaining to the Southland and Victoria Square Malls, the committee was not convinced the Committee had erred. 6)It was in reliance on the provisions in s.172(1)(c) and (d)","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property, the relationship between the parties, the nature of the financing associated with the sale, and the relationships between the purchaser and the purchaser. 3) It failed to establish that there was a presumption in favour of the correctness of the assessment and that the Committee was open to having regard for the sale sale price to the extent that it could have been substituted for any other information before it was relevant and not excluded from consideration by the Committee.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. On the first ground, which is a factual one, the test is whether the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter]. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that the appellant had, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. While the appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision, it must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of a trial judge, especially in matters involving findings of credibility. The extent to which an appeal court may assess or review the findings of a fact by the judge has been well defined in number of decisions, including R. v. Shepherd, [2009] S.C.R. 353, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII) at para. 20; R. vs. Biniaris, [2000] SCC 15 (3d) 571 [Luong] and [2010] Sask. R.I.P. (4 and half years of experience at the time of the offence] were sufficient to justify the decision to stop the appellant's vehicle for a breath sample. 2) There was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that she was impaired by alcohol. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is correctness. 3) On the factual and legal grounds, the standard of review is based on a factual and/or evidentiary foundation which forms the basis for the judge's decision to determine whether there was a s. 10(b) Charter breach. 4) The appellant's subjective belief that she had personally and honestly formed the opinion that she could walk and enter a vehicle to determine if the driver was affected by alcohol was not the only basis upon which the judge formed his decision that the accused was impaired.","[1] Chantelle Drake [Ms. Drake] appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over .08, on the following grounds:

b) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of the s. 10(b) Charter giving everyone the right on arrest or detention the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The alleged errors of fact are listed as follows:
a) The trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; [31] The trial judge, in attributing four and half years’ experience to the officer when in fact the officer had only three years’ experience at the time of the offence, did not commit material error.

Conclusion [62] For the reasons previously stated, Ms. Drake’s appeal is dismissed in its entirety.",0.4348925410872313,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the officer ignored evidence that the appellant did not require assistance for her to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser. However, there was evidence provided by Cst. Schmidt that he observed the appellant walking with wide stance that he perceived as the appellant's attempt to maintain her balance while walking.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The appellant contended that the trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer’s contention that she was impaired by alcohol. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high.  2) The court found that the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s. 9(b)(c) Charter right. The court dismissed ground one of the appeal on the basis that the appeal court did not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of the trial Judge, especially in matters involving findings of credibility. There was no evidence upon which a reasonable person would have believed the appellant was impaired if she had been given the opportunity to make that finding of fact. 3) The appeal court found there was not a material error in law in attributing four and half years' experience to the officer when in fact the officer was only three years’ experience at the time of the incident and the police may not obtain evidence from the suspect until that opportunity has been given.","[1] Chantelle Drake [Ms. Drake] appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over .08, on the following grounds:

Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.

c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me is whether it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred between the dates of October 1986 and 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. The accused was born on October 22, 1968 so that he ceased to be a 'young person' within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act on the first date specified in the indictment. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that she could not remember her age or date of the offences. HELD: 1)The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction respecting offences committed by persons while under the age of 18 years. The case before me has not come to me by way of transfer from the Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding is pending in Youth Court respecting these same events. The Facts Neither the complainant nor the accused are particularly credible as witnesses, each having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each has spent considerable time in jail. 2)Although the complainant was more credible as a witness than the accused, she did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to do so. Nor did his testimony leave me with any reasonable doubt the accused forced sexual intercourse with the complainant in the fashion she described and that he touched her on her vagina on one or 2 subsequent occasions. There is however no convincing evidence before me that any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on or after October 1986, the date he became an adult. The determination of the specific dates of multiple sexual assaults of children over period of time is not usually of critical importance, but it is in this rather unique case. Under s.486(3) of the Criminal Code, Youth Court Judges have exclusive jurisdiction over offences committed while under 18 years of age. The Court of Queens Bench accordingly has jurisdiction only when such matter is transferred to it pursuant to s. of the Act. 3)The only issue before the court is whether the sexual assault alleged occurred on the date that the accused became an Adult. The only issue is whether there was sufficient evidence before the Court to establish that any such incidents occurred. 4)The Crown could not find any dates beyond October 1986 when the accused moved out of Saskatoon.","The accused is charged with sexually assaulting the

The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.

Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described.

In essence, it is alleged that the accused operated an overweight vehicle on a road to which the Minister\'s weight restriction applied. 6 The Crown tendered a copy of a document entitled ""Order for Road Restriction on Provincial Highway #332"" and the documents purports to be issued under section 35 of The Highway Traffic Act, 1997. 9 The defence argues the following:

a) the document is not proof of the Minister\'s order according to law, and
b) even if the document is proof, the order is a ""regulation"" under the provisions of The Interpretation Act and so the provisions of The Regulations Act applies to it. I can only conclude that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.

In essence, it is alleged that the accused operated an overweight vehicle on a road to which the Minister\'s weight restriction applied. 6 The Crown tendered a copy of a document entitled ""Order for Road Restriction on Provincial Highway #332"" and the documents purports to be issued under section 35 of The Highway Traffic Act, 1997. 9 The defence argues the following:

a) the document is not proof of the Minister\'s order according to law, and
b) even if the document is proof, the order is a ""regulation"" under the provisions of The Interpretation Act and so the provisions of The Regulations Act applies to it. I can only conclude that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.

The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced [section 7(a) SEA] and it was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen\'s Printer [section 7(b) SEA].

No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.

As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.

Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.

The point is not that the degree of similarity in such a case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. 3) Logistical problems may be compounded by the lapse of time, surprise and the collateral issue rule. 4) The practical realities of the trial process reinforce the prejudice inherent in the poisonous nature of the propensity evidence itself.","[1] The accused has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the Beauval Indian Residential School between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967.

(a) that the plaintiff’s action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or
(b) that the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. On March 7, 2000, Mr. Kozak suffered a fire at his farm. On May 7, 2001, Mr. Kozak issued a statement of claim against one James Neigum, his tenant, and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company under Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001 in the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon. I find that the delay was inordinate. [8] As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. [10] The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. [11] The only reason offered by counsel for the plaintiff for the delay in responding to the undertakings was a busy schedule and determination was to be made about which undertakings could be answered and which were not answerable pursuant to the Rules. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery in this case. SUMMARY [20] Regarding the application to strike the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution, I find that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. With regard to the period of time June 2010 to May 2012 I find the period of delay not to be inordinate but even if inordinate and inexcusable, I would find that having regard to the principles set down by the Court of Appeal in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson that I would not strike the plaintiff’s claim. [21] With regard to the disclosure of settlement amounts I find that the defendant has made its case and order those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed.",0.3869047619047619,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative of having the plaintiff's action dismissed for want of prosecution or requiring the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance.

However, he appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. 4) Given the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding maintenance payments.","1) The applicant, Bradley McLaughlan, applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act, S.S. 2002, c.

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.

He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving.

Nor did the trial judge himself place any weight on the questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused. The issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or the complainant who was the driver of the truck at the time of the accident. 3)The appellant raised a number of valid objections on the veracity of the witnesses. 4)The defence argued that the appellant's cross-examination was improper and that his admission was more prejudicial than probative. 5)The Court was not satisfied the appellant had any effect on the trial.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed Smith J.A.

The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone.

The parties subsequently entered into an agreement in 1992 whereby the parties agreed the agreed rate would be greater. 5) The court was cognizant of the fact the petitioner had agreed in 1992 to pay at a rate that is greater than the legal obligation in 1992 and in 1992 he did not agree to the agreed to terms. 6) In the event of a delay in enforcement of the order, the maintenance enforcement office would be sitting in maintenance office as a result of an intercept.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears.

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.

Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: In the absence of something further I am not prepared to impute income. 1) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. 2) The respondent is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. 3) There is money sitting in the Maintenance Enforcement Office as result of a federal intercept. In terms of the payor’s ability, he says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his income the table amount would be approximately one-half of the $300.00 per month non-taxable that the respondent agreed to pay back in 1992.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least.

[37] I conclude that this Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant’s request, on a director appeal, because it is not a “true appeal” that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, this Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the defendant/employer’s application to open up of a noting for default should be granted. The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening up of a noting for default. It logically follows, therefore, that where a judgment is filed in this Court that this Court would be able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. [44] Accordingly, I find that it is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant’s request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals. [53] The applicant has failed to satisfy me that the third prong of the four-pronged test has been met and, accordingly, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of setting aside the Director’s certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.",0.3957055214723926,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) Has the applicant satisfied the criteria necessary to grant an extension of time in which to bring an appeal? 4) The Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross-appeal dismissed. The court found that the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code were invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate the plaintiff’s pattern of practice. The principles of the Protocol were not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. The Protocol was designed to facilitate the payment of physician services through the use of AU codes. The evidence at trial indicated that physicians had the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health care plan, billing patients directly or submitting accounts directly for payment. However, the fact he was not paid does not mean the AU coding caused that result. By marking service “AU”, the Government was simply asking for more information. It was not denying payment.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed/Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Carlos Huerto and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.

Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were in the best interests of their four children and that it would be in their best interests to have them in the custody and primary care of their mother.

The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The Act has since been significantly amended. This is a judicial proceeding where the legislation does not provide much by way of procedural requirements and the practice of counsel is to accommodate the deficiencies of the Act. The applicant protests that this is a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Commissioner or the Minister, and is not proper consideration on appeal. Section 19 deals with the right of appeal from the decision of Minister and the powers of the court on appeal are provided in 19(4); (4) The Minister and Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. It was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is used in any degree in the manufacturing process.","This is an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 126 in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA).

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.

Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.

This was the inevitable result of the trial judge's decision that the certificate of analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (the 'Charter'), the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) of The Charter, the admission of the certificate would bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: A new trial must therefore be held and ordered. 1)The appellant appealed the acquittal and the conviction set aside. 2)The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can at the scene it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the appellant had consumed alcohol within 15 minutes prior to the roadside test. 3)The Court of Appeal compared the facts in Einarson, supra, to those dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bernshaw, supra and at paragraph 22 concluded: 22 There are several factual similarities between the two cases. In both cases, the officers had proper grounds and the evidence was there for them. 4)The court found that the respondent was not required to wait 15 minutes on the grounds that he consumed alcohol in the previous 15 minutes. 5)The respondent's statement was not what he told to the officer. Having seen the two patrol cars pass him on the highway some five minutes earlier, it is also possible that he drove onto the grid road to dispose of an open can.","[1] On August 9, 2006 Mr. Lundrigan was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.

The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.

The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.

The first category is whether production by CN of document in respect of which it could have claimed litigation privilege waives any claim of privilege as regards background information to the document.

The plaintiff argues that the approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. HELD: 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. The statutory regime the Court must be sensitive to is the Trade Union Act. That legislation provides the Labour Relations Board with an exclusive domain on many matters dealing with industrial relations. 2) In this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to indemnity under the by-law. Rather, it is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of an indemnity by the Union by-laws. In that respect, the contest in this case is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. 3) In addition to clamorous debates at Union meetings and the three civil actions, there was a second front opened against the Union. The Union counterclaimed that the plaintiff was paying for the cost not only of the defence of the First Action but also the counterclaim contained in the Second Action. 4) The union counterclaim against the union was not supported by the evidence in the first action. 5) The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen’s Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment.

[39] The sentence that I have imposed on each of these offenders takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the City of Regina, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.

The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for nearly 10 months. HELD: 1) The sentence was increased to two years less a day for the appeal. 2) The Court of Appeal increased the sentence to two-years-less-a-day for the date of appeal.  3) The sentences were based on the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence, the defendant's lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offences, the violence against the victim, the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances.  4) The accused's criminal record consisted of two robbery convictions and four armed robbery convictions. 5) The Crown appealed the sentence.

The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.",The accused was charged with four counts of impaired driving. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in when she read the breathalyzer demand and that she was not feeling the effects of the alcohol until she arrived at the police station. The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. HELD: The accused was not guilty of the two charges. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and 9 Charter Rights of her. It should be excluded under s24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. There was no expert evidence called by either side. The certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breath test demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable.,"Count #3 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. Count #4 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in her blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 253(b) and Section 255(1) of the Criminal Code. [2] As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty of those two charges. [26] I conclude that the demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable and consequently, her rights under sections 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights were breached.

They each held a dairy operation with a total of 47,000 cows and a trailer park and a farm operation. The dairy operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, beef operation, trailer park, and a gravel pit operation. In the years since 1987 the evidence establishes that these two quotas separated in that it became possible to sell only MSQ. In fact, an exchange for the sale of MSQ was set up by the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission in November 1987 to do just that. The defendants sold the assets and the proceeds of the sale were divided in three ways. Gene Putnam testified that he was asked by his father to draft the agreements. He was not aware that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale and not all quota sold. He said he was not involved in any of the discussions with his uncles about the agreements covering the division of assets. HELD: The Court held that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of its milk quota prior to December 3lst, 2003, it would be obligated to divide the proceeds in the manner described in the agreement. The Court also held that there was no conflict of interest between the parties.","I find that all the parties to the agreement signed in March 1988 intended that the milk quota owned by A.A. Putnam & Sons Limited would be shared by all three if sold within fifteen years of that date. I would therefore rectify that agreement to read milk quota, which I find includes Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota. Based on that rectification I find that the plaintiffs are entitled to their respective shares of all the sales of quota made after March 1988.",0.10937500000000001,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought a rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant argued that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid. The plaintiff argued that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, the shares would have to be retained by the parent company and not all quota sold. HELD: The court found that the defendant was in a conflict of interest position. The agreement was not binding on the plaintiff.

e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 235 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence was admitted as admissible under the principled approach. 1)The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2)The evidence was presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 3)The accused was only charged with second degree murder.

2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months.

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract.

Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. Although an action on a foreign contract debt is sustainable at common law, the Adjudicator determined Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction.

The Adjudicator erred in finding that Eastside did not attorn to the jurisdiction of Alberta.","[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Small Claims Court Adjudicator wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants. [10] The Appellant appeals the findings of the Adjudicator on the grounds that he committed errors in law in interpreting the relevant sections of the Small Claims Court Act and in his finding that Eastside did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction. [16] I find the Adjudicator’s interpretation of Section 15 represents an error in law. I find the Adjudicator erred in finding that Eastside did not attorn to the jurisdiction of Alberta as there was no evidence on this issue and therefore, no basis to support this conclusion. [24] Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court’s jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment.

The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial although he and his girlfriend were cohabiting. He was served with the notice of the application, and the trial notice. HELD: The respondent was found not in need of protection. The court found that the respondent was in the best interests of the children and that he did not want them to be separated.","[1] The Department of Community Resources (“DCR”) seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2 (the “Act”) placing [C.S.] with the Department until age 18 pursuant to subsection 37(2); and [J.S.] with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest (“P.S.I.”) pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). [2] The children have the same biological parents, [T.K.] and [K.S.]. [T.K.] does not oppose the applications in respect of [J.S.] and [E.K.], but seeks the return of [C.S.] to her care. In addition, I am satisfied the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, [T.K.] and [K.S.] vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at [S.K.]’s apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, I am not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children’s needs. [106] Based on the circumstances at the time of the apprehension and currently, I am satisfied that the children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. [111] I am satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time, and that changes have already occurred. ORDERS [118] I find that [J.S.] is in need of protection and that he shall be placed with [S.K.] for an indefinite period. [J.S.] shall not be returned to live with [T.K.] or [K.S.] by [S.K.] without a further order of the Court. [119] I find that [C.S.] is in need of protection and that she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of three months. During that time [T.K.] and [K.S.] shall work co-operatively with and communicate with DCR to develop a case plan for [C.S.]’s return. [T.K.] will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR or by her family doctor and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional.",0.17898832684824903,"The Department of Community Resources sought orders pursuant to the Child and Family Services Act placing the children with the Department until age 18 and placing the grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The children had the same biological parents. The father was 13 years of age and the younger children were 13 years old. The mother was concerned about the hitting and the fighting between the father and the children and sought the return of the children to her care. HELD: The court found that the children were in need of protection and ordered that they remain in the care of the Minister until their 16th birthday. The court ordered that the father be placed in the custody of his grandmother until the age of 18. 1) The children did not attend the pre-trial or the trial.  2) The Court ordered the removal of the father from his current residence. He was served with the notice of the application and notice of trial. 3) An order placing the father until his 18th birthday did not constitute an order for custody. The Court found that it was appropriate to place the father with the Minister. 4) The Children were placed with their biological parents, [T.K.] and [E.K.'

He had been in foster care for three years and was living with the mother for three months.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.

1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. Although he has referred to his Charter rights in his application, he acknowledges that the required notice has not been given and that he is not seeking a Charter remedy. He declines an adjournment to bring a Charter application and with the co-operation of the Crown, copies of the record were produced and filed with the court to enable the accused's review hearing under s. 520 of the Code to proceed. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. 1)The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably justified as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood he would commit a criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice. 2)The accused indicated that he wants to continue to pick or carry placards pending his trial. He stated that if the desired amendment was made he will restrict his picketing to lawful activity. Yet he maintains the picketing he did, which resulted in the charges on which he now has been released pending trial, was lawful.","The accused applicant applies for a review of the
terms of his judicial interim release. I am satisfied in the circumstances and nature of
this case, that the picketing prohibition term imposed by the
justice with the consent of the accused, was reasonably
justified as a condition of the release of the accused from
custody. I am also satisfied that if the amendment is
granted as sought by the accused, there still remains a

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release.

The accused has not established that he is the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter. 3) The Court found that there was an actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention which was transformed into an arrest.

The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy.

(3d) 15 (Ont. S.C.) Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application for annulment of an assignment. There is likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. It also appears from the facts that the vast majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit. 3)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt because he has not yet filed a monthly financial statement and has been unable to make payments. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. It should also be mentioned that prior to bankruptcy the bankrupt attempted to deal with his financial problem through the orderly payment of debts. He also considered proposal post-bankruptcy but found out on an informal basis that it would be defeated. 4)The majority of secured creditors would benefit from the bankrupt`s request being granted. 5)If, as the bankrupt states, an annulments of his assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take.","The bankrupt has applied to annul his bankruptcy.

c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in a warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant did not file a statement of defence and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. The appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a notional claim to rights in 'common property' because the appellant will never be successful in obtaining from this Court the remedy of specific performance. The registration of miscellaneous interest is analogous to the registration of caveat protecting an interest under the former Land Titles Act.[3] Under that Act, the case law was well settled that an applicant seeking an order continuing a caveat was required to establish that he or she had an interest against the land against which the caveat was registered. In light of subsequent developments, the Court found nothing in the reasons of the Chambers judge which indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The chambers judge framed the issues in this manner: The preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. For the purposes of s.50 of The Land Tittles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under the Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest for a 'interest in land'. The appellant appealed. Title to Unit was transferred to the third party purchaser on October 9, 2007.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed (Orally) [1] On the hearing of this appeal, we dismissed the appeal with costs, with full reasons to follow.

5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was arrested for impaired operation of motor vehicle, read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and Demand for Blood and was cooperative throughout. However, he had no recollection of the officer ever placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. HELD: The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins. The Crown concedes that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly and if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires me to exclude those statements. The concession made by the Crown is correct. The officer was not acting in good faith. Indeed, he did not know the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. He was interrogating the accused after he had been arrested, explained what he was doing, explained his rights, his rights to counsel and further warned him that he was not obligated to say anything further to the officer. The accused responded by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The police officer concluded that the evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of his section rights, must now determine if the evidence so gathered must be excluded from the trial pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter. This is a more difficult decision.","[1] This is a decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused called out to him and said; “Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.” [10] The Crown concedes that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and if I find that the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires me to exclude those statements. [11] I find in this case that the accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. The Crown contends that if I accept that he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. [14] The Defence also argues that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence that was obtained by breach of the accused’s section 7 rights and was self- incriminating, I should find that the arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. Does is it not follow that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused’s section 7 rights? I believe so.

The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was in a rollover accident and was intoxicated. The Crown appealed the decision following a voir dire on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused testified that after the rollover, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. The defence argued that if the accused was given a warning, it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. HELD: The Crown conceded that the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of this belief, its admission would render the trial unfair. The evidence obtained though process of self--incrimination will generally be excluded in order to ensure the accused has fair trial. The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed not to make statements that are so dire as to result in a violation of the accused's s. 7 rights. In this case, the arrest was illegal and the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. The arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by breach of s.7 rights and were self- incriminating and were therefore inadmissible.

7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse following a trial before a judge and jury. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years. The pivotal evidence implicating the defendant came from the testimony of two former common law spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. Defence counsel initially argued that Vetrovec warning was mandatory and that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to caution the jury about the untrustworthiness of both the complainant and his friend. The trial judge did not give a warning in relation to either witness. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge must carefully assess the trustworthiness of Crown witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown. That said, the prosecution and my own counsel failed to appreciate the limitations on the inferences which could properly be drawn from the expert evidence. The jury should not place reliance upon the evidence of the Crown's witnesses without guidance from the judge as to dangers inherent in their testimony. The judge must give guidance to the jury as to the acknowledged wisdom of looking for independent supporting evidence when the witness in question had potential motive to lie under oath.  2)The defendant's credibility was inherently suspect and the importance of that witness's testimony to the Crown’s case were the main or prominent considerations.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

a. The judge fell into error in failing to warn the jury as to the dangers of relying upon the evidence of Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum following the decision in Vetrovec. However, the decision to give the warning is discretionary in nature, as is the content of the warning itself, and a trial judge’s exercise of this discretion is entitled to deference: He took a measured approach with regard to the need for a Vetrovec warning in the circumstances and he carefully solicited input from both Crown and defence counsel. I am also satisfied that, in exercising his discretion not to give a Vetrovec warning, he was particularly alert to the position advanced by defence counsel, which he clearly understood to be a tactical choice. [99] The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.",0.2164705882352941,"The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse following a trial before a judge and jury. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years. The pivotal evidence implicating the defendant came from the testimony of two former common law spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. Defence counsel initially argued that Vetrovec warning was mandatory and that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to caution the jury about the untrustworthiness of both the complainant and his friend. The trial judge did not give a warning in relation to either witness. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge must carefully assess the trustworthiness of Crown witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown. That said, the prosecution and my own counsel failed to appreciate the limitations on the inferences which could properly be drawn from the expert evidence. The jury should not place reliance upon the evidence of the Crown's witnesses without guidance from the judge as to dangers inherent in their testimony. The judge must give guidance to the jury as to the acknowledged wisdom of looking for independent supporting evidence when the witness in question had potential motive to lie under oath.  2)The defendant's credibility was inherently suspect and the importance of that witness's testimony to the Crown’s case were the main or prominent considerations.",0.11570247933884296

HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.

In carrying out that contract, the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendant commenced the action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order would have been made against the plaintiff. HELD: The order for security was granted and the defendant was ordered to post security. 1)The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for costs. 2)There is no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue. In general terms the statement of Madam Justice Fraser is just as applicable to an Ontario case as an Alberta one. 3)The respondent commenced the builders' lien action, which is the other action in this case. 4)The plaintiff commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99) wherein $50k was posted as security for the costs. That was the result of a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely affect the plaintiff's opportunity to defend the action. 5)The counterclaim is not wholly distinct from the claim.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.

HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to that of the respondent, even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the applicant. 2)Mainline became insolvent and ceased operations in November 2003. The respondent commenced the action to foreclose its two registered mortgages against the subject land. 3)The trial judge held that the second FCC Mortgage had priority over the first FCC Mortgage. 4)The appellant admitted that it had never intended it was going to obtain a special interest in the priority to be paid by the respondent and that the appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA. 5)The court held that registration, while arguably conclusive on the issues of notice and priority, does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.","[1] This is an appeal brought by the R. M. of Chaplin No. 164 (hereafter “the R.M.”) from a judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent, Farm Credit Canada (hereafter “FCC”), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.  The Rural Municipality of Chaplin (""R.M."") has approved the application of Mainline Pulse Inc. (the ""Corporation"") for grant aid in the maximum sum of $150,000.00 (the ""Grant""). FCC commenced the action to foreclose its two registered mortgages against the subject land. [59] I would have to conclude on the basis of the above authorities that the second FCC Mortgage has priority over the R.M. Mortgage, as the R.M. specifically agreed to a postponement in favour of FCC. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, viz., Mainline’s equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. [25] For these reasons, we concur in the trial judge’s conclusion that the fee simple mortgage of the respondent has priority over the fee simple mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent.",0.43037974683544306,"This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to that of the respondent, even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue.

The hearing officer also erred in holding that the fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated an fixed term.

The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing.

The evidence presented to the Court was that the co-op, with the authority of the provincial government, managed and had sole discretion in determining who was eligible to acquire a commercial fishing licence. The Crown argued that this was an important area for conservation and sustainable management for the Canoe Lake walleye population and that the closure of the fishing area was reasonably justified.","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

Further, there will be an order under s. 37(2) placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. (ii) I order that for as long as the children are in foster care, that the Ministry make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.",0.18749999999999997,HELD: The Court found that the boys were placed for adoption. The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoptions. The Court believed that the evidence indicated that the accused had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that the Court had no doubt concluded the Stevens home met the necessary standard. 1) The Court was also of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. It was also concluded that the respondent had the skills to cohere to routine. 2) It was not necessary for the Court to remind the Court that it has a moral and legal duty to ensure that foster homes have the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in such a home.,0.18055555555555555
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. He had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to traffic. He began drug use in his late teens. He was previously convicted of a designated substance offence. 2) the accused had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so. He appeared to have made little productive contributions to society or to his own advancement. 3) Prior charges, convictions and incarcerations did not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. 4) The accused was convicted of having in his possession quantities of cocaine and marijuana for the purposes of trafficking, which were part of the proceeds of the offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code. 5) There were few mitigating circumstances that the court could and should properly take into account in reaching its sentencing decision. The court gave the accused credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent on remand to a total of 23 months, 21 days credit. The amount involved was $16,325.98 which was transferred to the accused’s counsel at his request to pay his legal fees.","[1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: Count 1: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 to wit: cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.

The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors for failing to call an available expert witness to testify at her original civil trial. The defendants were engaged and retained to represent and defend her in respect of four charges laid by the College of Physicians and Surgeons against her; three charges alleging she engaged in the practice of medicine and one charge that she provided medical treatment not being registered under the Medical Professions Act. The plaintiff appealed the Provincial Court judgment to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal and Court of Appeal and ultimately she sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, all appeals and applications being dismissed. HELD: 1)The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non-suit. The jury therefore had no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiff in the evidence that she presented. 2)The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at the trial dealt with the very complicated and difficult issue of the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in regard of the preparation for and conduct of the plaintiff's trial in what is known as a quasi-criminal statutory offence (QPRA). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise, knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer.","[1] After the completion of the plaintiff’s case in this civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented this motion for non-suit pursuant to Rule 278A of The Queen’s Bench Rules.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the respondent-mother was in need of protection pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of the Child and Family Services Act. The Ministry sought leave to withdraw on grounds unrelated to the client's eligibility for legal aid services. Counsel for the parents argued that the Ministry had not been able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for C.T.’s needs.

order, of up to one year, under s. 37(7) of the CFSA. A.T. contends that,

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Crown did not promise that it would be bound by the findings of the Schafer judgment but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). 2) It is common ground that the Crown takes the position that it is not bound in this proceeding by any of the conclusions of the Court in Schafer. 3) The application raises substantively the same question as that of whether the Crown would consider a single transaction rule or, alternatively, to order the indictment to a jury. 4) There was clearly no promise by the Crown that its proceedings against Leibel would be somewhat dependent upon the outcome of the trial. The Crown was not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge.","[1] This is an application by the accused for: (1) an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada quashing Count #1 of the indictment as now amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; (2) an order pursuant to ss. 7 and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; and, alternatively, (3) an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. between the 13th day of October A.D. 1988 and the 26th day of March A.D. 1993 at the City of Saskatoon and elsewhere in the Province of Saskatchewan did by deceit falsehood or other fraudulent means, by using the funds of International Capital Corporation (ICC) to advance their personal business interests of Reginald Schafer and/or Richard Leibel over those of ICC, defraud the said Corporation and its preferred shareholders of money in excess of $1,000.00, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code by one or more of the following ways: (a) through (j) describe separate transactions, within the meaning of s. 581(1) and that count #1 of the indictment is therefore void. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word “transaction” as it is used in s. 581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single “transaction” may in this sense include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. On that application, I dismissed the application to quash count #1, indicating that I did not believe that the application raised a question substantively different from that already determined by Matheson J., but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment) and indicated to counsel that once particulars were supplied, I would consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to s. 590, if the accused could show, for example, that it would be prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. The application to quash count #1 of the indictment on this basis is therefore dismissed. [58] On a review of this matter, I am in fundamental agreement with the submission of the Crown that there has not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, the reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain periods of delay. This application to quash the proceedings is dismissed. Conclusion [65] The application to quash count #1 on the basis that it charges more than one transaction contrary to s. 581 of the Code is dismissed. [66] The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made by Klebuc J. in the Schafer trial is allowed in part as follows: [68] The Crown’s proceeding in relation to the particular charged in subpara. (j) of count #1 regarding the alleged representation to investors that 30 percent of their investment would be invested in GICs is stayed on the ground that to allow the Crown to now proceed against this accused with that allegation would constitute abuse of process.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Crown was not bound in this proceeding by any of the findings of the Court in the Schafer indictment. 2)It was common ground that the Crown then took the position that it preferred to proceed with the trial first and relied on the assumption that it would be beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the judgment in the Leibel matter before proceeding with the Crown trial. 3)The applicant's agreement to waive any objections to delay in relation to the application to quash count #1 was not in any way different from that made in the original indictment. 4)The Court was also asked to consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590, if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. 5)The accused's application to have counts quashed or stayed on the basis that they are part of a single transaction was dismissed without written reasons.",0.27210884353741494

The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the accused's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside. 1) The evidence which led the trial judge to conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway #11 was inconsistent. It was the defence's theory at trial, and Fleury's unwavering statement given to Cst. Poiré later that afternoon that he was travelling south on Highway 2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and swerved to miss deer that had come onto the highway. 2) There was no evidence to support the Crown's conclusion that Fleury swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs. The Crown could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the accused could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst.'Poiré. It seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two or three lanes it had to travel before leaving the pavement. 3) The trial judge was not circumspect about the explanation given to Fleury by Fleury. It seemed unlikely that the defence could make such a right turn without leaving the tire tracks. 4) The jury was not able to draw a rational conclusion from the evidence at trial. The evidence from the scene could not be drawn beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury could not rely on the evidence called by the police to prove the accused drove through the stop sign. 5) The Court was not convinced that the Crown could have drawn a reasonable conclusion from what Fleury had testified. 6) It was also not reasonable to conclude the accused was travelling at a high speed across the four lanes of traffic. 7) There could be no rational conclusion as to why Fleury would have chosen to roll over and swerve into the slough.","[1] Sean Fleury (“Fleury”) appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel disburse the funds from two mortgage brokers to the project. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the mortgagees. In early 1987, the plaintiff received a letter of direction from the second mortgage broker, requesting that the funds be disbursed to the creditors in order to keep them temporarily satisfied. The second mortgagee, who had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support, requested that the drawings from the third mortgage broker be confined to four or five draws. The first draw was contemplated for the end of March and its proceeds were to be used to pay off all accounts 60 days and over in full as per the prepared list of the mortgage brokers. The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of undertaking. HELD: The plaintiffs had not established a basis for a claim under breach of trust on this ground. Any claim under this ground was dismissed. 1)The defendant's conduct throughout his retainer as solicitor for the project was one of conscientiousness and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through various irrevocables letters of directions. 2)There was no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. 3)The plaintiff was awarded damages for disbursements of mortgage advances. 4)The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for breach of Trust.

In my respectful opinion the plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed. Firstly, I am not persuaded that the creditors continued to advance supplies to the project on the basis of Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 and, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the suppliers continued advancing to the project because they concluded that the project was still viable. Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials.

The plaintiff sought postponements of the mortgage advances in order to allow sufficient funds to be disbursed to other creditors. HELD: Any claim under breach of trust was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff did not establish the basis for a claim under 'breach of trust' on this ground. 2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purposed in any way to act for them or on their behalf. 3)The plaintiffs did raise an allegation of negligence on the part of the plaintiff. However, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever involved with the plaintiff or retained by them or purport in any manner to act. 4)The court found that the plaintiffs had not established a basis for an allegation under 'trust' and could not succeed on the ground. 5)The defendants were found to have acted in the best interests of the project.",0.13124108416547792

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin.

The Court was also able to conclude that although the accused had longstanding unresolved issues regarding his upbringing and was very resentful of his community, these factors were confirmed within the Gladue Report prepared by the Crown.

The elevated risk of flight in light of the committal order, the failure to abide by a community-based sentence, the nature of the sentence to which he is now subject in Romania, the exhaustion of his appeal rights in Romania and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations in this case.  4) The Court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that his s. 43 submissions to the Minister were not frivolous.  5) It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature.","[1] Valerica Cretu applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18, and s. 679 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment. 1)The defendant was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The evidence established the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing.  2)Rule 488 sets out the test for a summary judgment. 3)In the case of a person who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-maintained one. 4)In this case the plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant.","[1] The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer’s attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without just cause as set out hereafter. In this fiat I intend to set only the amount of notice the plaintiff was entitled to, and leave it to the parties to work out the damages the plaintiff is entitled to for the notice period based on his income and value of benefits for the previous 12-month period, less the six weeks’ pay he received, and less the wages and the value of the benefits he has received in his new employment during the notice period. [25] In the case of a person in the plaintiff’s position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-management one.

The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment.

If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer.

On November 19, 1993, McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. The application was heard by a Court of Queen's Bench judge in chambers who ruled Royal was not obligated to participate in defending the action ""because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal"". Therefore, Royal was under no obligation to defend McLeod in the pending action. Thus having embarked on a wide review of the policy the chambers judge concluded there was no ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs on double Column V.
