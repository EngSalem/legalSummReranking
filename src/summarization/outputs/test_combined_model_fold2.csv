The primary defence was that the police officer who detained the accused did not inform him of the reason for his detention and had not advised him that he could consult counsel. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1) The police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused. However, they did not have the means to detain him. The police officer, who had remained with the accused during the alleged operation of the vehicle, was not aware that the accused was the driver. When the police arrived at the scene, they approached the accused on his lawn. They believed and it was reasonable to believe that the complainant had positively identified the accused as the operator of the motor vehicle. Once detained, police officers may detain an individual if there are reasonable grounds to suspect in all the circumstances that the individual is connected to a particular crime and that the detention is reasonably necessary on an objective view of the circumstances. 2) The defence sought to exclude the evidence of the fob and keys which was a significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused, which was not supported by the physical evidence. The search and seizure of the keys and fob had no particular reason for the officer to be concerned for the safety of himself or others when he did the search. Applying the Grant analysis, would not have excluded any other evidence. 3) The Court was faced with a case where the defence breached the accused's rights for about 11 minutes, by not informing him of his detention or by not giving him his right to contact counsel without delay.","[10] The officers handcuffed Mr. Keil and searched him, retrieving a fob that operates the locks on the doors of a vehicle and some keys from the Accused’s pocket.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state.

The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012.

HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the ground, could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector. The respondent may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward.

The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence.

It was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. 2)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate either party. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found. However, the argument that the Crown failed to present sufficient evidence to present an offence or indeed an offence of any kind was not supported by this evidence. In either case the 'circumstantial evidence of opportunity' was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond areasonable doubt. 3)The entitlement to address a jury last, contained in s.686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, applies without a substantive curbing of the entitlement in this case.","Appeal Dismissed: 3 October 1994 (orally) The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the

cause of the injuries suffered by the victim, the question
is readily resolved by examining the circumstances
immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by
the description of the injuries given by the victim, (who,
although he did not remember how the injuries were
inflicted, had a very good recollection of their nature) by
looking at the photographs of the victim taken the
following day, by the opinions of both the counterman at
the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the
injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the
investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after
that. In either case the

evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial

is readily resolved by examining the circumstances

inflicted, had a very good recollection of their nature) by
looking at the photographs of the victim taken the
following day, by the opinions of both the counterman at
the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the
injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the
investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after
that. In either case the
circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient to
sustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. The traditional entitlement to present argument to a judge
sitting without a jury last, however, is a procedural
entitlement to which the curative provision contained in s.

They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence.

On the question of identity, it was true that there was no direct evidence to implicate either party. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found.

The Committee committed an error in law by undertaking a review at the request of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and not the Director of Medical Professional Review Committee. 3)It did not abuse its discretion or exercise its right to determine what was acceptable medical practice. 4)No error was made. 5)Costs were recovered by the Committee.,0.47249190938511326

The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration.

In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.

b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties were agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. There remains for determination the quantum ofmaintenance for the children, spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property.

If indeed Mary did receive the greater share of the pension, it could be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. However, fairness and equity required a combination of both approaches to be used. 3)The evidence showed that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-point) the termination and retirement method was the route to go.","If indeed Mary did receive the greater
share I am not satisfied that it was of any great significance
and, in any event, it can well be attributed to partial
compensation for her economic disadvantage. In this case we are dealing with a marriage of an
approximate duration of 15 years. Based on these considerations
and given the economic disadvantage suffered by Mary, I agree
with Cara Brown that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-
point) the termination and retirement method is the route to

It is understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 2)The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility.  3)The appellant had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.,0.6119402985074627

Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected.

Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment at 2:12 am, the officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. The roadside screening test was performed and the accused failed the roadside test. As result the officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample as requested by the defence. The officer read from his 'card' when making the screening demand and then read those demands from that card when giving his evidence. He offered no information about the ability of others in his company to observe the accused's drinking and driving behaviour.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the original policy. The Homeowners were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1)The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary SGI, which the insurer agreed to undertake. SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. It was clear that the trial judge relied on that portion of the application form where the previous McCallum Hill policy number was stated together with the reference to the support document SF 222. The question is whether these references provided an adequate direction to the insurer about the coverage that was to be procured for the homeowners. 2)SGI is not a third party to the Contributory Negligence Act. In practice, SGI does not compare a previous policy with a new policy application to make sure that any changes in coverage are intentional. There is no such general duty on the insurer.  3)There are a number of issues on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. In this case, the defendant insurer held SGI liable for the accidental breakage of its Swarovski collection, which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the policy. It is clear that TWC and SGI are intermediaries within the meaning of the term 'facilitator'. SGI were not the exclusive agent for one insurer.","Disposition: Appeal Allowed Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to The Contributory Negligence Act[1] for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. [6] SGI appeals and says the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in “all the circumstances”; and (b) breached its duty of care. [33] This Court concludes that Mr. Sebastian and his employer Campbell Haliburton, the defendants in this case, are liable in negligence for the loss suffered by the plaintiffs. [38] The circumstances alone, combined with the application for insurance which SGI received, leads this Court to conclude that SGI did breach its duty of care to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) in respect of the [TWC] policy it issued October 15, 1993, to replace the McCallum Hill SGI policy that expired the same date. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care; the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed; or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. [61] I conclude there is nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.

The court found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which it could easily have done by carefully reviewing the support file. SGI did not publish the coverage policy, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. The appellant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage provided under the McCallum Hill SGI policy. The appeal turned to an examination of the liability of SGI to the defendants upon the third party claim. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the appellant as he gathered the information from the homeowners, reviewed the existing coverage, and completed the application. However, the trial judge found that the appellant and his company, SGI, were intermediaries within the meaning of the term 'facilitator of loss'. The appellant admitted in evidence that he undertook to provide the homeowners with insurance coverage equal to or better than the one offered by SGI. The evidence showed that the respondent had information about the coverage and premiums for number of insurers as opposed to the standard set of coverage provided by the insurer. The Court found that there were a number of differences in coverage requested, culminating in a twenty per cent reduction in the premium from that charged for the original policy. As the appellant had examined the existing policy, it would have prompted him to ensure that the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the homeowners would have very specifically referred to the special scope of coverage.","Disposition: Appeal Allowed Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to The Contributory Negligence Act[1] for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant.",0.4915254237288136,0.49039881831610044,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the original policy. The Homeowners were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1)The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, not the broker. SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. It was not clear that the trial judge relied on that portion of the application form where the previous McCallum Hill policy number was stated together with the reference to the support document SF 222. The question is whether these references provided an adequate direction to the insurer about the coverage that was to be procured for the homeowners. 2)SGI is not a third party to the Contributory Negligence Act. In practice, SGI does not compare a broker to a homeowner to make sure that any changes in coverage are intentional. There is no such general duty on the insurer.  3)There are a number of legal bases on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. In the numerous cases listed in Brown (the trial judge concluded SGI had duty, and breached it in this case, that the defendants and third party each equally contributed (50%/50%) by their negligent acts, to the loss sustained by the Draders. The defendants plead against the third party in contributory negligence. It is evident from comparing the defendants' SGI policy and the coverage applied for by Sebastian that there are number of differences in the coverage requested, culminating in a twenty per cent reduction in the premium from that charged for the McCALLUM Hill SGI Policy. The defendant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage that he received from SGI on behalf of the homeowners.  4)In this case SGI is responsible for the loss caused by the collision of the parties' crystal collection (the Swarovski crystal collection) and the loss is due to an accidental breakage, which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the policy.","Disposition: Appeal Allowed Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to The Contributory Negligence Act[1] for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. [6] SGI appeals and says the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in “all the circumstances”; and (b) breached its duty of care. [33] This Court concludes that Mr. Sebastian and his employer Campbell Haliburton, the defendants in this case, are liable in negligence for the loss suffered by the plaintiffs. [38] The circumstances alone, combined with the application for insurance which SGI received, leads this Court to conclude that SGI did breach its duty of care to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) in respect of the [TWC] policy it issued October 15, 1993, to replace the McCallum Hill SGI policy that expired the same date. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care; the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed; or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian.

Furthermore, this offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 3) The Court found that it could not afford to negate the'reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community' of the accused.","[1] J.R.S. (“J.R.S.”) was convicted on September 17, 2008, of the following offences:
1. That on or about the 17th day of December, 2004 at T[…] First Nation, in the Province of Saskatchewan he did commit an assault on L.L.A. contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code. 2. That on or about the 20th day of February, 2005 at T[…] First Nation in the Province of Saskatchewan did break and enter a dwelling house to wit: House #[...] at T[…] First Nation and did commit therein the indictable offence of assault, contrary to section 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. [4] J.R.S. and L.L.A. (“L.L.A.”) had been in a common law relationship since she was fifteen years old. [6] Because the offence of assault causing bodily harm is a serious personal injury offence as defined in Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, the Crown applied for an order that J.R.S. be declared a dangerous offender. [108] The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which J.R.S. has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence as required by s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence is also conclusive that J.R.S. constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour as defined in s. 753(1)(a)(i) and his pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour as defined in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). [124] Thus, because the Crown has proved the essential elements of s. 753 of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt, J.R.S. is designated a dangerous offender. Because no lesser measure under s.753(4) will adequately protect the public, J.R.S. is sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. [125] As to the remaining eight charges (the six guilty pleas and two convictions), J.R.S. is sentenced to time served.",0.43194192377495466,0.4705882352941177,"HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 753(a)(i) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying against him. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove that the offender exhibited a substantial degree of indifference respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to others of his behaviour. It did not have to prove either of those things. The accused had met the onus of proving both patterns of behaviour in R. v. Lemaigre (2004), [TWLII], [2003] SCC 46.

Furthermore, this offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 3) There can be no burden of proof on the Crown to negate the third criterion contained in s753(1)(a). The Court found that it has a duty to be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the offender's risk in the community. This is not a question of satisfaction based on a proof beyond a reasonable doubt or any other standard of proof.

The latter had a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the store. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the formation of a lease. Sobeis opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunctive relief at the required threshold, that neither the plaintiff nor the lesee had established irreparable harm. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged.

There would be no remedy for the plaintiff until the balance of convenience and convenience have been met. The factual complication of the receiver's case was to be assessed simply in light of the underlying lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms. 1) This is not a case where there is too little or too little of a procedural fairness for the average judge to take the final decision. 2) Rule 9.02 (b) is preclusive of an application where there was likely to be a substantial dispute of fact. 3) The Court has a discretion to order final judgment","The receiver applied, by way of originating notice, for a permanent injunction against Sobeys.

There was no evidence of a mistake in the expression of the terms or the lease amendments. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted.

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff company applied for a permanent injunction against Sobeys and a temporary injunction restraining its operations in the Shoppers Drug Mart shopping centre. The latter had a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the stores. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the formation of a lease. Sobeis opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunctive relief at the required threshold, that neither the plaintiff nor the lesee had established irreparable harm. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than that of an interlocutory injunction. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), [1991] W.W.R. 712 (SCA), and Canada v. LeBlanc (1991), 1 S.C.A. 179 and 4C Concerned Citizens v. Cumberland (1997), S408/26 (NSSC). Both applications were brought in chambers. HELD: The application for the permanent injunction was dismissed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support an application under the terms of the original lease and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs would suffer harm if the operation was carried on in the same manner as that of the other drugstore in the mall. There would be no need for a final determination as there was nothing in the evidence which would suggest there was a final remedy for the breach of those terms. In the interim, the Court would take the position taken in Manitoba and Saskatchewan on negative covenants more seriously than it would have in the North American context.","The receiver applied, by way of originating notice, for a permanent injunction against Sobeys.

Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to comply with two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and he fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was given a global fine of $1,000 to $2,000, which he was fined in the amount of $8,050. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the Court was required to take into account the defendant's own actions, which contributed to the hazard of working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. It was also required to consider if there were other mitigating factors which could be considered by the Court to consider in determining a fit and proper sentence. The defendants were fined $28,000 for failure to properly supervise, inspect and inspect the guardrails before work was commenced in that area. The fines were set-off against the defendant based upon the failure of the labourer to ensure that a mid-rail was constructed or installed as required by s. 7(1), 9(1)(b) and 9(2)(d) of the Act and in both cases, the defendant thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 74(1(a).

The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.

The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3(3(1)(d)(i) or the Survival of Actions Act as amended.  2) The plaintiff's claim of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty is equitable subject to the 6 year time limitation period prescribed by s3.1(h). 3) In any event, the limitation period stipulated that the claim should be struck on the basis that the claims relate to internal management of the Residential Schools and acts that were 'distinct and separate' from any public mandate. As such, the 12 month time limitation time is not applicable to these claims. 4) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents.

The appeal against penalty is dismissed.",0.29032258064516125,0.4324324324324324,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and the Executive Committee, of the League which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee found that the appellant had misrepresented the report of the principal of a school division, and recommended that he be transferred. The discipline committee recommended that reprimand be imposed. The appellant received a reprimand and a fine of $2,500. Both parties submitted briefs of law in support of their positions. In issue was whether the findings of fact were true or unprofessional conduct as set forth in the grounds of s. 2 and s. 5 of the notice of appeal and whether the discipline committee erred in its application of the burden of proof. HELD: 1)The discipline committee's finding of credibility was supported by the admissible evidence. 2)It did not err in its finding that the conduct of the appellant was sufficiently serious to constitute professional misconduct under the Rules of Practice and Procedure of this Court. 3)The Discipline Committee's determination was based upon the direct evidence of the witnesses testifying and the exhibits as filed by the parties. 4)If the facts were in fact true, the appellant's misrepresentation of the report constituted professional misconduct and the imposition of a fine by the executive committee of LEADS for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. 5)Reasons for the discipline panel's failure to apply the standard of proof prescribed by the Code of Conduct of the Association of Physicians and Surgeons were examined.","Considering the evidence as a whole, I am unable to
say that the Discipline Committee erred in its interpretation
of ""professional misconduct"" or its application thereof to the
facts as found by it. For all of the foregoing reasons I dismiss the

The Discipline Committee, the Executive Committee and the League of Educational Administrators dealt with the issue of whether the appellant had misrepresented the substance of a report prepared by the Professional Development Unit to the principal of a school which the principal was a part of. In the discipline committee's decision, the Discipline Committee recommended that the principal be transferred, when in fact he was not the principal. The discipline committee imposed a fine of $2,500. The Executive Committee chose to accept the evidence of the principal over the appellant.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the findings of fact and applying the standard of proof as set forth in s. 51 of the LEADS Act, and ordering a new hearing or further inquiry by the discipline panel, that the conduct of the appellant was so clearly wrong, incorrect or contrary to the conclusion reached that it was unreasonable to award the appellant such a sentence.",0.4324324324324324

4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp) and the Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: 1) The application was cast as a request for restraining order under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of the Children’s Law Act and (f) that an order substituting a completely different parenting regime for the children would be in effect. 2) There was no evidence of alienation between the petitioner and the respondent. The children had primarily resided with the petitioner for the past four and a half years. The respondent had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order, given the short notice. The petitioner had little opportunity to do so. One option would be to adjourn the petitioner”s application to enable that to be done. There is no reason to believe that the children will be at any risk in the meantime.  3) An adjournment at this point would simply add to the time and cost of dealing with the problem to no particular end.

They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp), and has never been amended to include such a claim. The children have had their primary residence with the petitioner for the last three and one-half years. However, the respondent has engaged in parental alienation. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was not an attempt to change the interim parenting arrangements made for the children by the petitioner. It was an application to enforce a previous interim order made by the respondent that had been made for only four months. There was no reason to believe that the children would be at any risk in the meantime. The Court ordered an adjournment of the petitioner's application to enable her to make this application. 1)The petitioner was granted custody of the four children. 2)The interim parenting order was to be applicable in the short term, on an interim basis only, to ensure stability in the children's lives. 3)The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order.

On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.

He was charged with two violations of conditions of his release, including failing to keep the peace and failing to attend court.

The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose fromthe option agreement were merged andeffectively disappeared upon their registration. 6)The options were not being transferred to the Optionee but were reserved by the predecessor in title the Optionor of the Second Part and the covenants and agreed to enter into separate agreement with the Executors of the estate of Thomas Davidson, Jr. with reference to their reservation of such surface leases. 7)It was apparent in this case that there had been no intention that therent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years.  8)On its face it appears that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser","The option was exercised and a fee simple title was
issued to the plaintiff in 1973. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law
and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to
vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore
freely recognized to be the property of another, both before
and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. The plaintiff asserts that whatever rights arose from
the option agreement were merged in the transfer and
effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer
and the issuance of a new, and for this purpose, unencumbered
title. It
is apparent in this case that there was no intention that the
rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and
allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period
of about 15 years. On the basis of the foregoing analysis and with an
eye to s. 250 of The Land Titles Act which seems to underline
the jurisdiction of this Court, the declaration which has
been sought is denied. negated. The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge
has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued

Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount.

There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition.

The issues of liability and damages were severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants 57½% of the damages to be assessed, an amount which was not yet been determined by the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures. The defendants offered the services of rehabilitation specialist to the plaintiff in the amount of $168,000. This was predicated on the plaintiff's counsel's projection that his damages would likely be assessed in the final analysis at something in excess of one million dollars (less 42½% for contributory negligence). The plaintiff's actuarial report quantifies the past loss of income at approximately $216,000 using a valuation date of June 1, 2000. This head of damage has a much higher degree of certainty of recovery, subject to any arguments of mitigation which the defendants might develop. The evidence to support the validity of this claim was far from complete at this stage and the defendants had offered the rehabilitation specialist a sum of $20,000, which was incorporated into the order accordingly.

Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction.

The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they moved on two occasions. The petitioner gave no notice to the respondent of the intended move and he returned home without any warning or note. The house was in disarray and he feared that robbery had occurred and that his wife and children were injured or abducted. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident here. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia. 2)The mother had always resided in the matrimonial home with the intention that she would return to it and resume cohabitation with the respondent. She left quickly and secretly to prevent him from taking any court proceedings in British Columbia to stop her move. 3)The father had delayed in bringing an application for custody in BC because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the home, the evidence led to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, or acquiesce, to the children living with them in Regina.",0.5728155339805825

2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired operation of a motor vehicle. The court found as a fact that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 a.m. Both officers were adamant that they had the vehicle in their sight at all times, from the time the individuals got into the vehicle until they left the bar, at which point the vehicle started to back up. The entire incident took mere seconds and the entire charge was dismissed. 1)The defence did not accept that evidence nor did it leave the court with a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant. The officer was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the defence witness caused the court to have considerable concern. 2)There were a number of inconsistencies in the evidence of the two police officers. The first officer, who was driving the police truck, was found to be somewhat evasive on the main points of the evidence. The time lines were considerably different from time lines given by the other officer. The police officer thought it was approximately 11:30 or 1:30 p.m., four hour difference from the police vehicle's first contact. The events of that night were a bit of blur. However, her ability to observe what occurred and accurately recall it was severely hampered by her alcohol intake.","[22] Ms. Neigel was polite and cooperative both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination, however, I have no doubt that her ability to observe what occurred on December 5, and accurately recall it almost one year later at trial, was severely hampered by her alcohol intake on December 4 and 5. I find as a fact that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the truck and had been in the ignition since the time the group entered the vehicle. I do not accept that evidence, nor does that evidence leave me in a state of reasonable doubt. [30] In review, I am absolutely satisfied of the following facts: [31] I find Ms. Neigel guilty on count 2, the “over .08”, as particularized in the Information.

The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck.

The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","The Crown appealed against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result of his having committed two armed robberies. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence imposed was not a fit sentence having been imposed on the young offender for the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. 2)The sentencing judge also imposed a term of secure custody for escaping from the Youth Court, a term consisting of the time he had spent on remand awaiting disposition of the armed robbery charges.  3)The sentences imposed were to be served consecutively but concurrently with the remainder of the 2 year term of closed custody.","This is an appeal by the Crown against a sentence
imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result
of his having committed two armed robberies. The
Crown appealed on the ground the two terms of closed
custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with
the earlier term, did not constitute a fit sentence having
regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the
requirements of deterrence, and the need to uphold public
confidence in the administration of justice. As a result of that and of the
order directing the present terms be served concurrently
with the remainder of the earlier term, the respondent was
effectively sentenced to a term of six months in respect of
the armed robberies. Each of us is of the view the appeal must be allowed. The appeal will therefore be allowed to the extent
sought by the Crown. The two terms of one year each will

HELD: 1)The parties have included a covenant to comply with the Code in their collective agreement which does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it proclaims. 2)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform into a human rights violation or breach of the collective Agreement. 3)The dispute is a fundamental human rights issue and one which must be resolved by arbitration or other means. The parties are not able to contract out of human rights provisions. 4)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed, except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To adopt and apply any theory of implied repeal by later statutory enactment to legislation of this kind would be to rob it of its special nature and give scant protection to its rights which proclaim fundamental law. The essential nature of this complaint is that it is not a dispute arising out of a dispute between the parties about the interpretation, application or violation of an agreement as contemplated by s. 16(1). 5)Individual and collective agreements have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes between employees and employers. Whether or not a complaint is a public interest issue, it bears the essential element of common law and should be taken into account when making decisions of specialized tribunals. 6)The fact that the parties included an anti-discrimination clause (which does not include an exemption from sexual discrimination under s. 8 of the Act but which does) does not change the essential character of the complaint or change the question",0.6420787929589271

The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount.

The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease.

Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in front of a mall when the officers approached him. They noted a strong smell of burned marijuana coming from the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and noted that he was smoking a cigarette. They asked him where the cigarette was and he told them that it was from the inside of the vehicle. The officer did not detect the smell of marijuana from her person and the officer smelled strong, fresh smell of the marijuana on the accused. They arrested him and searched him and found no drugs or alcohol on his person. They also found no section 10(b) violation prior to the accused giving his statement to the police. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marijuana will be present. The Crown contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the defence. The facts were not in dispute. Both the defence and the Crown presented evidence that, in appropriate circumstances, the Court may accept as a reasonable inference that the accused is in possession of marijuana. However, detention from the point of first contact has not been proven. There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative, the officer had no special training and she was able to distinguish between a smell of burnt marijuana and smoke, and the accused appeared tired, spoke slowly and was very quiet. The evidence did not establish that he had recently smoked a marijuana cigarette. Although there were other possible explanations, none of which supported the existence of a police duty to advise the accused of his rights at the time of the search.","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights.

There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative, the officer did not physically restrain him, the CPIC check indicated that he was pending on a drug possession charge and the fact that he admitted to smoking a marijuana cigarette in public place provide additional grounds for believing that the person was in possession of un-smoked cannabis marijuana.","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights.

There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative; the officer had no special training and could not lay claim to extraordinary olfactory acuity, but she was aware of what burned marijuana smelled like. 2)Although there was no police caution prior to the arrest, upon his detention the officer was entitled to be informed of the reason therefor and of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, per s. 10 of the Charter; there were no police duties to advise the accused of his rights during the search. 3)The defence had no grounds to exclude the statement given by the accused to the police and, therefore, the Court found that the officer could not rely on an inference that there was a person committing the offence of possession of marijuana. The Court held that the accused elected not to avail himself of the rights conferred upon him by law, rather, by reason of his failure to disclose the facts relevant to the search of his person and because he had not been provided with the information that led to the conclusion that there had been a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present. 4)The court found that it would be unfair and unconscionable for the police to detain the accused until they had found out what the accused had been doing and then refuse to provide that information to the officers. The decision was upheld on appeal","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights. The defense have also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the police. Although there was no police caution, I find that his statement has been proven to be free and voluntary. [19] The statement of Mr. Stone to the police occurred before Mr. Stone was detained, and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise him of his rights. I find no section 10(b) violation prior to Mr. Stone’s statement to the police. [53] In my view, the facts or circumstances known to the arresting officer at the time of arrest provide a sufficient basis to conclude, and I do conclude, that the officer’s subjective belief that Mr. Stone was in possession of marihuana was objectively reasonable. Therefore, I find that Constable Lynch had the authority to arrest for present possession of marihuana pursuant to section 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. I accept the evidence of Constable Lynch and find that the search of Mr. Stone was incident to his arrest and for the lawful purpose of securing evidence. [54] I am not satisfied that the accused’s section 8 or section 9 rights under the Charter were violated. However, without going into great detail, let me say that, if I had found a breach of the accused’s section 8 and/or section 9 rights, a section 24 analysis would have resulted in a decision not to exclude the evidence given due to:


(a) the seriousness of the charges facing the accused;
(b) there being no bad faith on the part of the police;
(c) the evidence not being conscriptive; and
(d) the fact that the accused could have been lawfully arrested for admittedly having violating the condition to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. [57] The motion to exclude the accused’s statement to the police is denied. [58] The motion to exclude the results of the search of the accused’s person is denied.",0.5024875621890547,0.600203458799593,"The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in front of a mall when the officers approached him. They noted a strong smell of burned marijuana coming from the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and noted that he was smoking a cigarette. They asked him where the cigarette was and he told them that it was from the inside of the vehicle. The officer did not detect the smell of marijuana from her person and the officer smelled strong, fresh smell of the marijuana on the accused. They arrested him and searched him and found no drugs or alcohol on his person. They searched the vehicle for several minutes and did not find any marijuana.

b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the respondent's counterclaim is allowed. 1) The trial judge was of the view that the phrase 'farmout agreement' is equivalent to way of describing a'reversionary interest' and the parties reached an agreement in principle. The only matter to be resolved was for the parties to satisfy themselves that Tarragon had good title. 2) The lease was not void by reason of common law rule 21. Rather, it was best left to the legislature to decide whether the lease breached that rule. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3) The evidence established that there are hundreds of 'top leases' in this province. Tens of thousands of leases in various stages of development, from exploration to production, all of which have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to their vesting, to being retained within the meaning of the rules of construction. The phrase 'in the event' connotes time and condition and not property or an interest in property. That uncertainty precluded the parties from simply proceeding on their own. 4) In this case, the plaintiffs were awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the respondent and one half of the common law shares.","Appeal Allowed: Judgment affirmed.

The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3) The evidence established that there are hundreds of 'top leases' in this province. Tens of thousands of leases in various stages of development, from exploration to production, all of which have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to their vesting, to being retained within the meaning of the rules of construction. The phrase 'in the event' connotes time and condition and not property or an interest in property. That uncertainty precluded the parties from simply proceeding on their own. 4) In this case, the plaintiffs were awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the respondent and one half of the common law shares.",0.4441939120631342

The defendants had initially moved for a stay, arguing that a certification hearing would be a preferable procedure for the representative plaintiffs to advance their litigation. The plaintiffs sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. In December 2010, the plaintiffs filed a notice seeking certification under s. 7(1), naming of two classes of property owner and residential. In May 2012, the defendants filed an amended motion for stay, that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area but increased 7 year habitation requirement. The proposed boundaries were challenged in the Court of Appeal's decision. In September, the plaintiff filed notice of appeal, which sought to strike the certification order for common issues trial in class. The Province moved for stay pending certification. In the meantime, the AGNS filed a second action, this time against the Government of Nova Scotia, challenging the proposed boundaries. Application for stay dismissed; the parties and the court approached the December 2010 hearing as addressing an amendment to the original Motion, not a replacement for the motion which had been presented at the earlier sessions.

However, there is a potential for prejudicial confusion if the Court of Appeal decides that the proceeding on behalf of the potential claimants on whose behalf the representative plaintiffs commenced the action were to be certified. That is a par for the course of appellate litigation, not irreparable harm. 2) Under the proposed litigation plan that Justice Murphy's decision approved in principle, the next ten months would involve the completion of the pleadings, the exchange of documents and (after documents are exchanged) the discovery of the parties. 3) The Province's grounds of appeal are arguable on their face. There is nothing to estimate that would be significantly higher. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code; and with driving over.08, contrary with s.253(a). The accused was co-operative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. However, the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not reliable evidence of impairment. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. On the evidence, the accused walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. Therefore, he was not guilty of the offence of impaired driving.  2) In all criminal cases, the trial judge must be satisfied that, prior to convicting the accused, he's satisfied that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. If the evidence is so frail as to leave him with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, he must be acquitted. The accused's rights under s.9 of the Charter were breached and the evidence obtained from that breach should be excluded. 3) The nature and quality of the impairment assessed by the officer was so reliable that he was able to observe it in the absence of reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. In this case, the Court found that the accused was not in a state of intoxication sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss.8 and s.8 of the Code to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. The admission of the certificate of analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. 4) In respect to the admissibility of evidence, in v. Stellato (1994), [1994] 31 CR (4th) 60, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following observations: 5) The officer was at the scene with the accused for approximately fifteen minutes and that ultimately the accused provided breath samples of 160 milligrams and 150 milligram at 2:56 a.m. and 3:17 a.","[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about July 10th, 2000, operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired, and also, operate a motor vehicle while over .08, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. [2] The following issues arose during the trial:
1) Was there a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained, in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand? If there was a breach, is there a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter?
2) Is the evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? As well, the accused was co-operative throughout, and he did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. As such, I must conclude that the evidence of slurred speech is not reliable. [18] In light of the foregoing, I find that the evidence is sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. Specifically, I conclude that the Certificate of Analyses constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. [19] Therefore as well, in the absence of the Certificate of Analyses, the evidence herein is not sufficient to prove the offence under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused is not guilty. Issue: Is the evidence sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? [21] As mentioned previously herein, I do not regard the evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. [22] Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. In the context of Stellato, in my view, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave me with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.",0.6869158878504672,0.6734006734006734,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.

Therefore, it is not reasonable for the officer to expect the accused to be able to secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable or probable grounds for the demand. 2)In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights and he was stopped behind vehicle at red light. However, thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired, rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. He appeared to be fully comprehending the situation at the time he took the breath demand. 3)The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. As well, he was aware of the presence of two green lights but he could not locate the accused seated upright behind the wheel, wearing a bathing suit. He grabbed him by the wrist and the accused woke up immediately and was able to comprehend what was happening. In the process of making its analysis, the Ontario Court of Appeal judgment made reference to the so-called 'classic' signs of impairment, namely: erratic driving, strong odour of alcohol, glassy eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet. Obviously this was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of given case.","[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about July 10th, 2000, operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired, and also, operate a motor vehicle while over .08, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. [2] The following issues arose during the trial:
1) Was there a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained, in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand? If there was a breach, is there a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter?
2) Is the evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? As well, the accused was co-operative throughout, and he did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. As such, I must conclude that the evidence of slurred speech is not reliable. [18] In light of the foregoing, I find that the evidence is sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. Specifically, I conclude that the Certificate of Analyses constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. [19] Therefore as well, in the absence of the Certificate of Analyses, the evidence herein is not sufficient to prove the offence under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused is not guilty. Issue: Is the evidence sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? [21] As mentioned previously herein, I do not regard the evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. [22] Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. In the context of Stellato, in my view, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave me with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.",0.5967365967365966,0.6741321388577828,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code; and with driving over.08, contrary under s.253(a). The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. However, the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand.  2) The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. The accused's eyes were glassy and glassy. 3) In respect to the admissibility of the evidence, in the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the police officer was not able to find any reasonable or probable grounds to make a breath demand despite the fact that he was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. The officer was able to conclude with a brief and cursory observation of the accused that his ability to operate the motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. On the same evidence, he observed that the vehicle did not move despite that the traffic light turned green at least twice. 4) The nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the officer with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under the s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.  5) In other cases, the Court held that a certificate is not to be admitted where the 'prerequisite reasonable and likely grounds' have not been present. In either event, the peace officer is vested with a very important responsibility which is intended to ensure that members of the public are not subjected to breath demand and all of the serious consequences that may flow from it, in which the accused has been made out.

If the evidence is so frail as to leave him with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, he must be acquitted. The accused's rights under s.9 of the Charter were breached and the evidence obtained from that breach should be excluded. 3) The nature and quality of the impairment assessed by the officer was so reliable that he was able to observe it in the absence of reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. In this case, the Court found that the accused was not in a state of intoxication sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss.8 and s.8 of the Code to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. The admission of the certificate of analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. 4) In respect to the admissibility of evidence, in v. Stellato (1994), [1994] 31 CR (4th) 60, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following observations: 5) The officer was at the scene with the accused for approximately fifteen minutes and that ultimately the accused provided breath samples of 160 milligrams and 150 milligram at 2:56 a.m. and 3:17 a.",0.6734006734006734

The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.

The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in sentencing youth to a high sentence. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant, he has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 3) The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 4) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. A trial judge must establish the facts, including the acts or omissions of trial counsel, upon which the claim of incompetence is based. Second, the appellant must establish that the representation provided by the trial judge was incompetent. The appeal must be dismissed. 5) The evidentiary onus on an appellant alleging incompetent counsel was outlined in Short (2012 SKCA 85). An appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by trial level court in only two circumstances. The first is when the sentence is demonstrably unfit. The second is when it is unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA).","Sentence appeal allowed; conviction appeal dismissed [1] The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46. [2] The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. [3] For reasons on which I will elaborate, the conviction appeal is dismissed. The sentence appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed is varied to 12 months of probation. Therefore, this ground of appeal must be dismissed. [49] It is well understood that an appellate court must show “great deference” to a trial judge’s assessment of witness credibility: The trial judge properly instructed himself pursuant to R v W.(D.) and I see no basis to interfere with the conviction. [57] Therefore, the appellant’s conviction appeal is dismissed. [71] Recognizing that the concepts of deterrence and denunciation were secondary factors already considered when imposing youth sentences prior to the 2012 amendments, the addition of s. 38(2)(f) in 2012 has been observed as imposing a relatively insignificant change to the approach sentencing judges took prior to 2012. [74] According to Bala & Anand: “the 2012 amendments add specific deterrence and denunciation as sentencing factors for youth offenders, but these factors are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of ‘diminished moral blameworthiness’ in section 3, and hence are of lesser importance than they are for adults” (at 128). [89] I am of the view that, considering the significant passage of time, imposing a custodial sentence would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it is contrary to the long-term protection of the public given that it is unlikely to promote, and may in fact impede, the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. A custodial sentence at this point, five years after the offence occurred, would not serve the objectives and principles of the YCJA, including “timely intervention”, compliance with youth’s “perception of time” and imposing meaningful sanctions that promote rehabilitation and reintegration. [104] Therefore, I conclude the objectives and principles of the YCJA are best fulfilled by a sentence of 12 months of probation. Conclusion [105] In the result, the conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal the sentence is granted and the 18-month custody and supervision order is varied to a probationary term of 12 months.",0.48633093525179855,0.5049180327868853,"The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

Triple R offered the plaintiff a car for his daughter. The plaintiff purchased the vehicle for $1,600. He was not satisfied that the vehicle was unsafe from the outset. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The consignee was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly was deemed to have given the plaintiff's vehicle a reasonable period of time. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and were properly recoverable. 2)The plaintiff did not reject the vehicle. The dealer was not negligent in failing to establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions.  3)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered.",0.49754500818330605

It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest.

It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129.

Peak is therefore prohibited by subsection 34(2) of The Business Corporation [sic] Act (Saskatchewan) from making any payments to redeem the Plaintiff’s preferred shares.

The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2). In considering all of the material filed on this application, including the cross‑examination of Mr. Beveridge on his affidavit, I am not satisfied that the defendants have demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that there is real insolvency on the part of Peak Enterprises Inc. To that end, I am also mindful of the failure of the defendants to provide responses to the undertakings following from the cross‑examination process which occurred on July 22, 2005.

The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent a debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. There is no merit to the defendants' denial in paragraph 2 of their original statement of claim that the corporation has any obligations to redeem preferred shares. The Court was of the view that s.34(2) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s.33(2). In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Corporation is or would be insolvent as required by s. 34(2)(a) of the Business Corporations Act if summary judgment were to be granted in favour of the plaintiff.","1. An order pursuant to Rule 129 and 133 of The Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, for an order granting the Plaintiff, Margaret Fehr (“Fehr”), summary judgment against the Defendant, Peak Enterprises Inc. (“Peak”), as follows: The amended notice of motion also seeks an order pursuant to Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. 9. Peak is therefore prohibited by subsection 34(2) of The Business Corporation [sic] Act (Saskatchewan) from making any payments to redeem the Plaintiff’s preferred shares. To that end, I observe that the plaintiff’s motion does not require Peak Enterprises Inc. to “make any payment to purchase” or to “redeem any redeemable shares.” [18] I am of the view that s. 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2). In considering all of the material filed on this application, including the cross‑examination of Mr. Beveridge on his affidavit, I am not satisfied that the defendants have demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that there is real insolvency on the part of Peak Enterprises Inc.

The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) for an order granting her summary judgment for the sum of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the court is in agreement with her that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. It was at this time that the appellant began to become aware of the company's real financial situation. He had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. Consequently, he could not be placed in his original position merely by returning the purchase price. The trial judge determined that the trial judge had correctly calculated the damages, prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the business was less than what the appellant paid for it. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to $1,800,000, representing lost return on investment opportunities for 7 years.

The applicant will be the defendant, but shall bear a burden of proof with respect to the alleged undue influence, and all the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial of the foregoing issues.  4) The Court recognized the difficulty of proving coercion which is part of undue influence and recognized the legitimacy of drawing inferences of undue undue influence from suspicious circumstances. It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses.","[29] In this case, based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence, and the law, I am of the view that the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue.

Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089, which says that if a testator is not induced by undue influence to sign a will, then it is for those who propound the will to overcome the suspicion.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a 61 year old single male suffering from epilepsy who lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one of which was for a sexual assault which involved touching the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching the victim's spouse or common-law partner and touching her inappropriately. The complainant was on social assistance at the time of the offences and had a back problem which prevented him from gaining employment. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused's record at a low risk to re-offend, given his previous criminal record and the fact that the victims were children. HELD: 1)Three years was the appropriate starting point for the sexual assault as it was a singular incident and the accused was not in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. The fact that this was a single incident of sexual touching that occurred over a few seconds gave rise to the idea that the accused, who had two prior convictions for sexual interference, was a high risk to offend again, even where he was without a criminal record. The appropriate range of sentence for R. v. Revet, 2010 SKCA 71, is a comparison between a sentence for fleeting touching and one for sexual assaults upon women who were incapable of giving consent due to being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or sleep, or combinations thereof. 2)Three is the appropriate sentence in the circumstances. This case is instructive for cases involving brief sexual contact over clothing. The Crown and defence both filed cases setting out various sentences. At the time the accused committed these offences, he was sentenced to 14 months incarceration followed by 12 months probation. A conditional sentence order was not available in this case.","1. Oakley Michelin has been found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. 18. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the time of these offences do not allow a conditional sentence. 21. As stated, at the time that Mr. Michelin committed these offences, s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code precluded the use of a conditional sentence order for a “serious personal injury offence” which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. The incident occurred over a very brief period of time, being a matter of seconds, but no longer than a minute. Taking into consideration both the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the principles of sentencing, the facts, the circumstances of Mr. Michelin, the jurisprudence and the principle of totality, I am satisfied a sentence of one year on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by two years of probation, with conditions, is appropriate. 50. As such, I sentence you, Oakley Michelin, to a sentence of one year on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by two years probation with the following conditions: There will be an order pursuant to s.487.051 authorizing the taking of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA in accordance with that section.",0.4154929577464789,0.417391304347826,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.

The offence occurred when the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area while she was asleep. The complainant told the accused that he had forgotten his phone. The accused then fondled and fondled the complainant and her breasts over her clothing. The two women stayed at the accused's residence between ten and thirty minutes. While the parties were at the residence, the accused moved onto the bed behind the complainant, removed her pants and positioned himself on top of her. On the second occasion, the complainant awoke to find the accused kissing her on the lips and on the other occasion, he fondled her breasts and digitally penetrated her. The assault lasted approximately 30 seconds and the accused stopped immediately when the complainant indicated her lack of consent. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration, concurrent on each charge, and one year probation. HELD: 1)Three years is the appropriate starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according to the aggravating and mitigating factors. This is no reason why the same starting point should not be used in case such as this. Sexual assaults are at least as high in terms of gravity, if not higher, than sexual assaults upon children. 2)The accused is 61 years old and lived in Labrador. He has two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. The most recent of these convictions was 14 years ago. The Court of Appeal held that the appropriate range for offences of this nature is conditional sentence ranging between three and twelve months. 3)In R. v. Ashby, 2009 SKQB 441, the court held that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances. The Crown and defence both filed cases setting out various sentences. The trial judge found that the accused was guilty of both counts and sentenced him to 30 months incarceration.

At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. DECISION [55] For the aforementioned reasons, the application is granted.",0.3404255319148936,0.4794520547945206,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer did not have a conflict of interest and that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because they had a mutual understanding of the terms of the agreement and that they would be unable to collaterally use the same lawyer to defend their client. There was no delay in the application. The reason the plaintiffs were disqualified was because their lawyer had given them confidential information which could prejudice them in the within action. As the plaintiffs possessed relevant information from a former client that could prejudice their client, a reasonable person would not be able to conclude that confidential information was imparted to the Holgates' law firm because the information was so relevant.",0.448780487804878

At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges.

The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code.

The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, two counts of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant, who was senior and more experienced in the trade, being at large on his recognizances. The defendant claimed the complainant had pushed him to buy cocaine, and that he had physically prevented her from doing so each time. During the events at the hotel, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant and the defendant was acquitted. The elements required for self-defence were not present on either charge. The accused was a large, very muscular man with a large build and was of the opinion that the complainant was the driving force in obtaining cocaine. He was described as being very level-headed and had a very muscular frame. His assertion that cocaine affected the complainant's behaviour makes little sense when the drugs were consumed the previous day. However, his repeated assertion that she was in 'cocaine psychosis' and his concern about same does not explain his reaction to her mental state. There was no requirement that the defendant measure his force to a nicety and the force used was excessive. On these facts, it is clear to the defendant that he knew she was trying to leave the hotel and that she had been savagely attacked by him minutes earlier.

3. She provides the Trustee with the VIN number on the 2007 Cobalt vehicle and with the information required to complete the income tax returns which the Trustee is required to file.

4. She pays the Trustee $300 for the horses.

5. She pays surplus income as provided in paragraph [60].",0.350597609561753,0.46950092421441775,"The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She refused to cooperate with the Trustee on this application and argued that they were assets of the estate and that she should be compensated for the loss of her household goods which were taken from her in the past. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. The evidence at the hearing was that she did not. 2)She had little time to make arrangements. She incurred expenses in moving. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. 3)There are other ways to determine surplus income, such as under the Judicature Act or under the Civil Procedure Rules whereby this information might have been obtained and possibly may now be obtained. There was ample time for this to have been addressed.  4)It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or character or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. It is not the policy of the law to convert into money for creditors the mental or physical anguish of the bankrupt. Put another way, the creditors are not entitled to benefit from that which the bankrupt receives to make whole her injured body, mind or reputation. 5)In the circumstances, the respondent's obligation to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months to 12 months is not unreasonable. The Court reviewed the various types of surplus income and found that most of the surplus income should be paid to the respondent. The respondent should be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible. 6)Costs of storage for sale would mean very little when one confronts the market. The pension should not be considered in calculating surplus income.",0.47202797202797203

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. of the Charter. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the acquitted accused. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the ASD demand on the accused. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1) The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing it. 2) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion and the evidence was reliable, relevant and necessary for the Crown's case.  3) It found the officer, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand the accused provide incriminating evidence against himself' (R. v. Gunn, 2012 SKCA 80).","This is a finding of fact. The trial judge stated he would have expected there to be a smell of alcohol on the breath of the accused if he had recently consumed the beer. As a result, the trial judge disregarded the admission of drinking, and evaluated whether a reasonable person would suspect Mr. Plantje had alcohol in his body on the basis of the careless driving and his red eyes combined with the absence of a smell of alcohol or other signs of recent consumption. It is the opinion of this Court that a reasonable person during a traffic stop after erratic driving, in the early hours of the morning, would perceive the question Cst. Kowalenko asked to be referring to recent consumption of alcohol. A reasonable member of the public would perceive the question to be referring to alcohol consumption that could impair a person's current ability to drive. [40] It was also reasonable for Cst. Kowalenko, despite Cst. Kowalenko's imprecise use of words, to infer from the answer given by Mr. Plantje that Mr. Plantje had consumed three beer at a recent, relevant time. This did not prove that Mr. Plantje had consumed the three beer recently, but it is certainly reasonable for a police officer to infer the consumption was recent, for the purposes of a reasonable suspicion, when such an answer is given by a driver in these circumstances in an unqualified manner. It is this Court's opinion that an admission of drinking by a driver, when questioned by a police officer, provides even stronger support for a suspicion that the driver has alcohol in his body than the generalized smell of alcohol emanating from a car window does.

There was an element of reasonableness which was found to be significant in this case, especially in the context of the s. 24(2) Charter application.  3) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion and concluded it was not reasonable to demand a sample of his breath when the officer first asked the accused if he had drank any alcohol that evening. It was reasonable and there was no other reason for detaining the accused that he was not drinking at the time the demand was made. 4) The accused's actions were found to have shown an unfortunate disregard of his Charter rights.","This is a finding of fact.

5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment.

Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent ultimately countered with an application for variation in March 2004. HELD: 1)The guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an annual basis. Given the pattern of the respondent's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he nevertheless retains significant net assets. It is reasonable to impute additional income to the respondent for 2002. Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952, the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. 2)The respondent has been awarded costs of this application.","[1] Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Madam Justice E.J. Gunn on April 30, 1999. He seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984. On the same basis she also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. [8] Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952.00 realized in the Province of Alberta, child support of $1,186.00 would be payable on the first $150,000.00 of income and a further amount of $742.00 would be payable on the balance for total child support of $1,928.00. It is self-evident that Mr. Marzolf has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does Ms. Marzolf. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents’ support. Given Ashley’s limited ability to earn income during her short hiatus from school and considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parents to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority. Suffice it to say that this is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted.",0.4716981132075472,0.2961702127659574,"Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment.

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child remained in need of protection and the Minister ordered that the child be placed in the grandmother's custody as a person of sufficient interest for a period of 4 months. This was a sad case as most proceedings under the Child and Family Services Act are. We have two very young parents who want to care for their child. The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child and, if so, if physical or emotional harm is likely to occur to this child. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested in the Minister's report. Given the nature of the threats and the parents' failure to cooperate with them regarding when the baby was to be picked up, it is reasonable that the parents would have thought that this child was seriously abused by her youthful parents. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act for threatening to kill anyone who entered the home or touched the child or disturbed them while they were in the process of parenting. The mother's relationship with the father was poor and she did not have a positive relationship with him. She was unable to parent the child for long periods of time. There was no evidence that either of the parents were able to parent. The plan put forward by TK would have placed the child in the custody of the grandmother but for the fact that it would allow the parents to have more access to the child and to allow them to begin programming with the child, that would have resulted in a more positive relationship.","[42] Having heard the Minister’s evidence - the child protection workers, the family support worker, the police officer and grandmother TK, together with having read the FASD assessment - I am satisfied that WBA was in need of protection on November 23, 2015, when apprehended. I conclude that the parents were not, at that time, able to care for WBA and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to this six week old baby. [43] Similarly, when I consider the plan put forward by CB - to return the infant to the parents’ care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandfather BA, who was living there on the apprehension date, and a friend and neighbour of her’s - and even considering any programming done by the parents, I remain satisfied that this infant would remain in need of protection. I have no hesitation, considering all of her involvement to date, in finding TK to be a person of sufficient interest, and I so order under s. 23 of the Act. While not foreclosing the possibility of placing the child in their custody at a later time, I am satisfied on the evidence at this hearing that WBA should be placed in TK’s custody, as a person of sufficient interest, for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the Minister, but I have considered that: (1) given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to their child so as to build a more positive relationship with him; and (2) there was no evidence that either parent abused or mistreated this child. Given both of these considerations, I view four months as a sufficient time for the parents to begin building a positive relationship with their child through access and, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to care for their child so that child would not be in need of protection.",0.5997248968363136,0.4346153846153846,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him.

The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child continued to live with the parents until November 2015, when she was apprehended by the RCMP. The RCMP were called to the farm where the child had been apprehended. At the farm, the parents and child protection worker met with the child's grandmother, who lived there for most of her life. The grandmother was angry and swearing and the young parents, who were not able to care for the child, locked the child out of the house, locked her in the house and threatened to strangle her and she was alone with the baby for about six months. The mother, who was working full time and living with the grandmother, was concerned that the parents had been involved in a physically abusive domestic relationship and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the six week old child. The father was charged under The Child and Family Services Act s.11(b) for assaulting the grandmother and threatening to kill anyone who came into the farm or their home without proper parental supervision and/or assistance. The young parents were ordered to participate in a parenting program designed to build a positive relationship between the parents. The order that the child be placed in the custody of the Minister's designated person of sufficient interest was not satisfied on the evidence presented that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in the child not being in need of protection. It was a question of what order should be made under s.17 of the Act. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody for a fixed period of 4 months. That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested. The plan was to return the child to the parents' care in the same location as on November 2015 with the support of grandmother TK and a friend of her's. Even considering any programming done by the parents, I remain satisfied that this infant would remain in a condition that neither the father nor the mother participate in parenting programming pursuant to s.13(1)(b). The parents will be responsible for providing parenting programming to the child for four months.","[42] Having heard the Minister’s evidence - the child protection workers, the family support worker, the police officer and grandmother TK, together with having read the FASD assessment - I am satisfied that WBA was in need of protection on November 23, 2015, when apprehended.

[43] Similarly, when I consider the plan put forward by CB - to return the infant to the parents’ care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandfather BA, who was living there on the apprehension date, and a friend and neighbour of her’s - and even considering any programming done by the parents, I remain satisfied that this infant would remain in need of protection. I have no hesitation, considering all of her involvement to date, in finding TK to be a person of sufficient interest, and I so order under s. 23 of the Act. While not foreclosing the possibility of placing the child in their custody at a later time, I am satisfied on the evidence at this hearing that WBA should be placed in TK’s custody, as a person of sufficient interest, for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the Minister, but I have considered that: (1) given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to their child so as to build a more positive relationship with him; and (2) there was no evidence that either parent abused or mistreated this child. Given both of these considerations, I view four months as a sufficient time for the parents to begin building a positive relationship with their child through access and, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to care for their child so that child would not be in need of protection.",0.582089552238806,0.37520938023450584,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her.

The Court also ordered the removal of the current application to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day care and control of the children with the father.

Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in Nova Scotia. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) To succeed on their survival of actions claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate and be enforceable by his personal representative against the defendant. The appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The proper remedy is for the estate to recover damages for loss of expectation of life. 3) In this case, the Court adopted the appropriate interpretation of the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act (which excluded causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his spouse).  4) In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these provisions, the court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation as well as admissible external aids.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [7] The appellants, in their action under the Survival of Actions Act, advance a claim for Paul’s lost earning capacity. In a written decision reported at (2001), 2001 NSSC 83 (CanLII), 195 N.S.R. (2d) 44, the learned Associate Chief Justice concluded that the estate was not entitled to do so because loss of earning capacity does not constitute an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate,” as required by the Survival of Actions Act. The context of the legislation, its purpose and its text all support the conclusion, in my view, that the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings is not an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and is therefore not recoverable in a Survival of Actions Act claim.

Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation was enacted in 1954 (Survival of Actions Act, S.N.S. 1954, c. 12) and it was reviewed several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in this matter. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. Whether the respondent was negligent and liable for damages in relation to the death of the deceased have not been decided. Whether Mr. McDonald was at fault is a question for the Legislature. 2) To succeed on their survival of action claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate and be enforceable by her legal personal representative against the defendant.  3) The fatal injuries legislation does not do away entirely with the common law rule barring wrongful death actions. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways. The claim under the Nova Scotia legislation is limited to defined class of persons. It provides for compensation for all of them, but in one action, and the compensation to which they are entitled is primarily for the loss of support they reasonably could have expected to receive from the deceased had he lived. If the redress is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial. 4) In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these statutory provisions, the Court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, its purpose and the consequences of proposed interpretations and special rules of interpretation.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [7] The appellants, in their action under the Survival of Actions Act, advance a claim for Paul’s lost earning capacity.

She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were found to have either one or more bent web members or were not compliant with the National Building Code. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the mall. The defendant, based in Sydney, claimed that the repairs were necessary but the reinforcing of the joists was not necessary to repair the defects. Awarding the defendant $7,000 for the remediation costs, that the respondents had not been properly trained in the welding trade and that the respondent had not conducted proper quality control. The court was concerned that the quality of the work performed by the respondent was not satisfactory and that necessary repairs were not being undertaken to alleviate the danger. Regarding the respondent's claim that the building was in danger of collapse due to the failure of several of the respondents' windows, the respondent admitted that he had inspected some of the defendants' joists and found them to have cracked, broken or missing welds. For the plaintiff, that his first visit to the mall was in 1979 and he observed that many of the welds and joists had been covered with slag, which made it impossible to inspect for weld length and freedom from defects. When he visited the respondent again in May, he was unable to say how many times he conducted such an inspection. HELD: The respondent was correctly told that the slag deposits in the joints were the cause of the problems in the mall, and therefore there could be a real and substantial danger to the occupants of the building. Further, there was no evidence that additional remediation was required.  1) In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty or more years and had a failure rate of 1% or less, only failed welds or members would be repaired. 2) The respondent's failure rate was 8.3%. 3) The failure rate for all respondents was 7.5%. 4) There were a couple of incidents that were beyond the scope of this report, but overall the respondent did not conduct any type of inspection. The respondents were all concerned about safety concerns arising from the mall's collapse and did not inform their supervisors of this concern. The issue was whether there were any real or substantial problems that were caused by the defendant's negligence and whether repairs were being undertaken in the manner they were intended to alleviate this danger.  5) A number of subcontractors were hired to inspect the premises.

her hand at being a part time sales person and at direct home
sales. However, I prefer and
accept the evidence of Roger over Mr. Protz when there is a
variance in their evidence. I consider it appropriate that all the assets be
valued as the same time. On the evidence before me and given my substantial
reservations as to the activities of Mr. Protz herein and as
to the financial statements and records subsequent to the
October 31, 1992 statement I consider it appropriate to value
the assets as of the time of the application. I value Mr. Protz\'s interest in Protz Power Inc. at
$192,727.00 being the mid-point of Mr. Kalesnikoff\'s
valuations. (1)From the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home Mrs.
Protz is to receive the sum of $13,500.00 by way of
equalization for the monies paid out to clear Mr. Protz\'s writ
of execution; A charge in that sum is created against
the matrimonial assets that become Mr. Protz\'s as a result of
my judgment herein. (6)There will be a transfer to Mrs. Protz, by way of spousal
rollover, of monies in Mr. Protz\'s R.R.S.P. and to the extent
of $84,000.00. (7)Settlement proceeds from Mr. Protz\'s claim against J.I.

of $12,000.00, are to be assigned and paid out to Mrs Protz. Mrs. Protz shall now have judgment against him

to be paid and if necessary is to be enforced, all as provided
earlier in these orders I do however consider that Mrs. Protz
had been economically disadvantaged to some extent arising
from the marriage or its breakdown. Until Mr. Protz satisfies the orders that I have
made herein, Mrs. Protz shall receive spousal maintenance in

The executor had no clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor and appeared to have a weak grasp of how they were dealt with. The niece argued that there is no basis upon which to remove the present executor if he is not capable of supervising the affairs of the estate or if he has no idea of the investments and activities of Mr. Conrod, a third party. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The applicant was 99 years old and had difficulty with eyesight and hearing. He spoke very little English and could not recall many details of his daily routine. He appeared very confused most of the time. His wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to her bank shares. She therefore was not qualified to carry out her duties under the Act.  2) There was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the deceased was not competent to administer the will. There was contrary evidence submitted by the estate in the affidavits of Ms. Brooks and Mr. Finlayson. However, it is my view that, although the deceased has some recollection of certain events and is not able to instruct counsel in the circumstances, based on all the evidence, that he has sufficient presence of mind to instruct. 3) The application to remove an executor is dismissed.","[1] The applicant, Elaine Brooks seeks an order removing the executor, Alexander Finlayson, pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act. The applicant, a niece of the testator, is the alternate executor. [3] The applicant argues that the evidence given by the executor on discovery in March 2006, “raises grave concerns about his mental competency to continue to act as executor” and suggests that Mr. Finlayson “has passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship” to John Conrod, a third party. I am satisfied from a review of the discovery evidence that Mr. Finlayson does not have a clear understanding of his duties. [25] On the equally important second test, however, I am satisfied that Mr. Finlayson himself is the only person whose interest is at risk if he fails to properly administer the estate. He is the only beneficiary of the will.

He made it clear that he relied heavily on his wife (who was very secretive and possessive with respect to her shares) in dealing with his affairs. He suggested that his wife had passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship of John Conrod, a third party. The executor applied to the court for a hearing to show cause why the testator's interest in those shares should not be treated as an asset or, in the alternative, subject to certain trusts. Application dismissed; the applicant had no clear idea of what an executor was and that he had not met the primary duty to instruct counsel in the circumstances.

If this Court were to draw a distinction when the legislature has not, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s8(2). 2) With regard for the nature of general appellate legislation, it is necessary to consider the role of the legislature in The Registered Nurses Act in The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, 1978. 3) The legislature amended The Registered Nursing Act, 1993, by granting specific right to the discipline body and to the nurses to appeal from Queen’s Bench unless an enactment “confers only a limited right of appeal” (SS 1959, 12). 4) The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out, but that enactment must provide a 'providing' for that purpose, and that a further enactment confers a “confer only limited right’ to appeal.

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: 1) The plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants. There were numerous breaches, both explicit and implicit, of the plaintiff's contractual right to bid on his behalf and for its own benefit. 2) There were a number of alleged breaches which raised the concern of breach of contract, but none central to the final analysis. 3) There are indications that the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserve auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid or for its benefit. There was nothing in the original contract between the parties that could have constituted binding contract. 4) In the interim, the plaintiff was approached by the defendants, who were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market already dominated by commodity-price competition. The defendants were determined to be the primary purchasers of the goods at the auction. They were also determined to have been the primary dealers of the equipment. 5) The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of plaintiff, purchased the equipment from the defendant in 2003 and intended to sell it to the highest bona fide bidder. He was concerned that if the plaintiff bid indirectly on an owner's behalf, or for his benefit, the defendant would void the contract. He sought to establish himself as the primary dealer. He refused to supply equipment to the plaintiff but offered to refurbish and sell equipment for resale. He also refused to accept a commission for","2) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkachuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. 109) The plaintiff’s claim for damages for trespass and conversion must be dismissed.

A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The defendant, Ritchie Bros., declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. These documents raised issues of breach of contract insofar as the plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to allow another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) There are indications the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. While a number of issues were raised at trial, the preeminent issue was whether clause 4.05, and its 14% commission rate, amounted to a penalty clause and whether the plaintiff should be relieved of its consequences. 2) In the circumstances, the plaintiff consigned his goods for sale to the highest bidder and was not precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly, in the bidding process. There were no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums. 3) The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of the plaintiff, was initially approached to see if he would be allowed to bid at the sale. He was not the only person who was trying to contact the plaintiff. When he was told he would not be able to bid, he was advised that he would have to wait until August 1, 2004 to make the necessary correction. 4) When the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. They then declared the contract void. 5) The plaintiff argues the taking amounted to trespass and conversion and seeks damages. 6) In any event, the issues in the final analysis are between litigants well versed in auction etiquette. The issues have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions","2) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkachuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. 109) The plaintiff’s claim for damages for trespass and conversion must be dismissed.

The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie.

The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.

The corporate applicants were corporations in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors.

In this sense, this concept is explained in Susan Hosiery. The distinction between the 'litigation' or 'lawyer's brief' privilege and the 'Solicitor client privilege' was established in the cases of Wolch's Guaranteed Foods Ltd. v. Melfort, 1994 CanLII 8935 (AB QB), 84 SaskR 117 (Q.B.).

30, 1988, item # 5. Moreover, the February 26 letter is not itself a communication
with the solicitor and, indeed, appears in substance to be
advice offered by the accountants to the applicants. In conclusion, then, I uphold the privilege claimed
in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal
advice sought from Nancy Hopkins after January, 1995. #10-12. I do not uphold the claim in relation to items #3 and
4.",0.473758865248227,0.6372881355932203,"This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were companies in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The accountant was not acting as representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice but as a liaison between the client's accountant and the applicants' solicitor. He was acting as agent or representative for the client to whom the client was directed. 2)The 'lawyer's brief' rule was upheld on the basis that the accountant's brief was an accounting information given to the client by the applicant to complement the legal advice given to him.  3)There was no litigation contemplated in this case. The 'client privilege' extended to communications between the parties for the purposes of obtaining legal advice.  4)Soleman and client privilege extends to communications to or from third parties in the context of litigation. 5)In this case, the accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant. The accountant's role was to direct the applicants to the solicitor and to arrange for the production of the documents.  5)The central issue in this application was whether and to what extent solicitor andclient privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties for which the appellant is privileged from production of documents. 6)The fact that two of the applicant's sons were instructed to arrange a meeting with the accountant falls within the scope of communications between a solicitor and client. The fact that the son was instructed to prepare the documents for the accountant to receive and receive his solicitor's advice was not inconsistent with his personal presence or involvement in these communications. The better view, however, is that the more recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the appropriate relationship of agency for the solicitor.",0.6301369863013698
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was confronted by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation escalated to the point where the accused threw the knife at the complainant, who ran towards the vehicle, chased after him, and slashed the complainant's tire, and then ran into the back alley. The complainant confronted the accused in his dufflebag, grabbed a knife, and, in very close quarters, the accused and the complainant threw a number of bottles at the officer, who, in turn, saw the accused running towards him and, while he did not see the knife, heard the complainant shout something and the accused grabbed a large butcher knife, which he held in his hand and, as the complainant testified, the knife was still in the defendant's hand. At trial, the defence argued that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the two men and the words used by the defendant spoken to the complainant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. The Crown also raised the issue of self-defence in the context of several other cases. HELD: The accused is guilty of assault. The evidence established that the accused initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the complainant. The fact that the complainant did not further assail the complainant or touch him could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s.267(a). The Crown has established that by these actions the accused threatened to apply force to the defendant and that the knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code.","1.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.

It is impossible, if not impossible, for a cardiologist to perform as effectively as he did in his clinic without significant hospitalization costs or involvement with the medical community.

The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance.

The Committee gave a lengthy written decision. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been properly explained to the Committee, they were reasonably supported by the evidence before it. 2)There was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the Committee's involvement in the hearing. The Director of Professional Review did not advise the appellant of such things as to the extent that he was prejudiced in his assessment of the patient costs associated with cardiology practice. He was found to be competent to conduct cardiology. His practice was unique in that it was based on a pattern of medical practice that was out of line with the billings to medicare by the other cardiologists. His evidence was uncontroverted with one possible exception: the negative assessment of his practice was made by a former cardiologist in correspondence with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. It was not known whether this correspondence was placed before the Committee.  3)It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose the duty to act fairly and to provide procedural fairness. It is not right that institutional bias is raised in the roles of the director and Committee assigned to them by the Act. 4)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings.

After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself.

She divided the residue of her estate between her two daughters, the respondents Sandra and Leslie Gallagher. In the 1990s, the respondent transferred title to the house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF to the appellant. The appellant took the position that the funds did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

The RRIF beneficiaries brought an action against the appellant claiming that she received it as trustee upon an express trust to be distributed to the respondents in accordance with the terms of the will; this appeal was against that judgment. The trial judge found, as matter of fact, that the respondent intended the funds to go to her granddaughters and to give the administrator a binding discharge. Accordingly, when the appellant received the money, the section was complied with and he was precluded from claiming the funds for himself. The appellants appealed. Appeal dismissed. There is something more than the lack of consideration proving that the transferor intended the money to be given to the grandchildren.

The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.

They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment, which provided that the husband would pay child support of $3,350 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, which was established when each of the children were born. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the spousal support order ended) and having him available for employment within months of that order. The husband asserted that he had no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would result in a different order of support. In addition, he paid the full table amount of child support payable by the parties in the amount of $5,000. The wife's application to vary support was dismissed. The parties made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The oldest child, who was 23 at the time of the order, had not graduated until October 2006.

In the fall of 2005, the mother, who had recently graduated from an American university, applied to vary the amount of child support payable by the husband (who had previously been granted $3,100.00 per month); in the spring of 2006, the husband cancelled the education savings plans (CST), claiming that they had been discontinued for non-payment. The husband argued that the mother had failed to meet the onus on him to change the circumstances related to the marriage, which had resulted in a different order of support based on his current income. Application to vary spousal support dismissed. The parties had made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The mother had finished course work in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and had not been employed or actively seeking employment since January 2006. The father's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month; his annual income was $153,116.76 US or $203,706. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the mother graduating from the American university in 2005. Any reimbursement due from the father's employment as result of the payment of private school fees would be retained by the father. There was no evidence of the mother seeking employment with respect to the establishment of AWEDANS. She was responsible for her own choices.","9(v) ...I respectively submit that spousal support should be extended up to and for one year past my eventual graduation dated October 2006.

The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment, which provided that the husband would pay child support of $3,350 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, which was established when each of the children were born. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the spousal support order ended) and having him available for employment within months of that order. The husband argued that the change in circumstances related to the marriage would have resulted in a different order of support if it had been known at the time of the original order. Application dismissed. The mother had made a series of cross-applications regarding child support. In 2005, the husband ordered that the three children remain in the mother's care and that any reimbursement due from the father's employment as result of the payment of private school fees shall be retained by the mother. In 2006, the mother ordered that all the children's school fees be paid directly to the husband, with an appropriate adjustment to the payment to both the husband's children. In 2007, the wife was awarded $1,000 per month in child support payable. This amount was reduced to $592 per month and reduced by $2,958 per month.

The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana was not necessary or required in all cases.

The board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra-vires. 1) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Court was of the view that the board's Interpretation that the Review of the Board's Decision to Denay reimbursement of Medical Marihuana was reasonable. 2) The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. It does not appear to be the case here that Board's reasoning that it cannot rely on blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of a particular drug is unreasonable. There is no evidence before the Board that it was required to determine whether or not to reimburse the costs of obtaining, growing, or using medical marijuana (i.e., the smoked form). The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of that Act.

The Court held that the conclusion the Board had had exclusive jurisdiction to refuse reimbursement falls within the ranges of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. 3) There was nothing in the language of the statement that could be said to suggest that a determination that the medical aid is not 'necessary or necessary' or'required' is unreasonable but this is not the case Here.

Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant questions the term of the rental contract which stated that the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof and the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment was water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimer. 2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The defendant was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions in all the circumstances. In all, the defendant was only 20 percent responsible for $250.00 in damages.  3) The Court assessed the damages at $200.00. 4) The court found that the damage was purely cosmetic with no discernible functional damage whatsoever. No stains were shown or explained to him and he simply drove off the lot, no doubt in rush because he was now several hours behind schedule. No attempt was made to have the items professionally cleaned. In the circumstances, the court assesses damages totalling $250,000.","BACKGROUND [1] The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

Even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional 2 days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. 3) The Defendant's claim against the plaintiff for damages totalling $1,250.00 and mitigation of damages of $100,000.00.  4) The Court assessed the value of the defendant's possessions at $800,000 and awarded quantum damages of damages to the plaintiffs.",0.5573033707865169
1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff, Phoenix, applied for the dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, a vessel that would have made a significant contribution to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. Phoenix had been detailed to calculate the business loss resulting from the loss of the Sealife III. Phoenix called various witnesses on the basis of the application that the plaintiff had failed to make reasonable effort to produce the documents and to give full discovery to the defendant. Phoenix's evidence was unsatisfactory. It was difficult to understand why estimates of weight would be used when the fish is being weighed on arrival at the plant, unless, of course, the estimates were understated. There was also evidence concerning the use of truck scales, which were kept at the defendants' plant. HELD: 1)The plaintiff had not been properly informed of the use and validity of the scales upon which the calculations were to be made. 2)The defendant was not under any obligation to provide the plaintiff with the information requested. Rather, it was placed on the shoulders of its employees to filter the information supplied. The conflicting evidence and positions of the parties presented at this application make it necessary to make certain findings of fact and credibility. If find the defendant's evidence credible and acceptable, the matters may conclude that it had produced the information reasonably required of it and such other information was not relevant.  3)The court was unable to address the evidence presented by the employees of the defendant as to the methods to be used in calculating the value of the sealife III landings, or to conclude that the weight of the fish actually received was in relation to the amount owed to the fishermen.","While such failure is serious and with very considerable financial implications, I am not persuaded that it was of such a degree of contumacious conduct as to warrant dismissal of the action. Nor do I conclude that its failure warrants a dismissal of any damage claim arising from loss of contribution to margin. A586 person examined for discovery may be further examined by his own counsel in relation any matter respecting which he has been so examined.",0.19537275064267354,0.2287234042553192,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information.

The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin that it would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant and that the failure to make a reasonable effort to give full discovery did not impact the decision as to whether the fish should have been produced. The scales were kept at the defendant's plant and were regularly used by the plaintiff to check the fish tonnages. During its preparation for trial, the defendants pressed the plaintiff for information as to the true weight of its fish, which led to an apparent impasse on the correct methods of calculation and a great deal of confusion as to what information Skipper actually had. The retrospective calculation of landings using the method said to be employed by the defendant to calculate the paid weight of fish landings, according to plaintiff, led to the conclusion of an improbably (if not impossibly) efficient production or, (I add) to the conclusions that the weights were greatly understated by the use of the scales. The conflicting evidence and positions of the parties presented at this application made it necessary to make certain findings of fact and credibility. The only reliable information available was from the defendants' records, which were kept on a daily basis between the efforts of the employee who gathered the raw information and gave it to the employee, who entered it into the scribbler. These records were carefully preserved and had been relied upon by other employees of the defendant.","While such failure is serious and with very considerable financial implications, I am not persuaded that it was of such a degree of contumacious conduct as to warrant dismissal of the action.

However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.

The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused, the police officer made the demand and she provided a suitable sample. This delay was not satisfactory to the accused and prejudiced her. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit. There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time from arrival at the scene to the time the tests were taken.

The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: The issue is whether the children are to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. The parties commenced common law relationship in 2000. There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the mother in La Ronge but with the petitioner having access on weekends. The evidence discloses that the respondent sold her home and business in March 2013. The petitioner says he asked the respondent if she was planning to move. The respondent says she hasn't replied. HELD: 1)It constitutes an error in principle, and reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. Once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on a final order. In this case, the parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent. 2)The interim order was made in the amount of $1500 payable within ten days from the date of this judgment.","I find that this co-parenting was a de facto co-parenting arrangement between the parties. I am also satisfied that there is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent. CONCLUSION [8] I find on the evidence that the parties are to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. I find the preservation of the status quo is in the best interest of the two boys. [9] I make the following interim order: 1. That the children shall have their primary residence with the petitioner in Air Ronge, Saskatchewan; 3. Such access arrangement shall continue every second weekend until further order of the court; 5. The petitioner shall make appropriate arrangements for the supervision of the children so that they are supervised prior to their attendance at school and after school if he is unable to personally provide such supervision. 6. The respondent shall be entitled to generous telephone access to the children which shall include at least three phone calls per week;",0.4884318766066838,0.5762711864406779,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: Further to the hearing on May 7, 2013, the issue is whether the children are to be relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. HELD: 1) The parties had a verbal co-parenting arrangement for some time. This arrangement was in place from January 2011 until April 2013 when the respondent unilaterally relocated the children to Melville. The parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys.  2) The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the boys. Therefore, the boys are to reside in LaRonge or Air Ronge, Saskatchewan and attend school there while residing with the petitioner. 3) There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent.  4) There has been numerous decisions of the courts on the issue of interim parenting of children. These principles were set out by Laing J. in Guenther (1999) 1999 CanLII 12554 (Q.B.). 5) The case law provides that significant caution is necessary when deciding whether custodial parent should be allowed to move with child on an interim basis, i.e. before trial of the relevant issues. This is so because an interim change of location can all too easily be a disruption to the child's best interests.","I find that this co-parenting was a de facto co-parenting arrangement between the parties.

It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.

9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then went to hold that the appellant was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. Appeal Allowed. From the outset, the trial judge distributed the value of the family property on the premise its distribution was governed by s. 21 and 23 of the Acts. The respondent, faced on appeal with the possibility the judge may have misapplied these sections, contended the matter was governed not by s21 and 23 but by s22. HELD: The appeal was allowed.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of s. 23(1)(a) and (c), which exempts property acquired prior to the commencement of spousal relationship from distribution. The definition extends to persons who have cohabited with one another as spouses for a period of 2 years. 2) There was a finding of fact, but it was not sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) There are number of facts that merit an exemption, even if it is unfair or inequitable to require a confirmation of confirmation of the debt or obligation to repay on numerous occasions. There are a number of exemptions which must be considered in order to give equal consideration to the loans. 4) The respondent's position regarding the loans and the mortgages in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions.","Disposition: Appeal Allowed [1] This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, S.S.1997, c. F- 6.3, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor.

The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabited with one another continuously for two years. The issue was whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the value of the Vancouver property was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of the spousal relationship. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Whether it would be unfair or inequitable to allow the respondent to claim any right, title, or interest in the house itself was to be determined in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of s. 23(1)(a), and the equitable consideration regarding debts.  2)The trial judge did not err in awarding the respondent an equal share of the property. Rather, he treated the house as the matrimonial or family home.  3)The evidence showed that both parties were cohabitating continuously for a period of 2 years. 4)The respondent's application for distribution of the family property, having regard for the equitable considerations mentioned in s. 21 and s. 22, was governed by section 22 rather than section 21 and 23. The significance of this finding is that the fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between the parties spousals effective as of late June 1994 as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23.5. 5)The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1999 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask. C.A.). 6)The appeal turned to the respondent's treatment of the house in Vancouver. The judge turned first to the exemptions provided for by ss. 23. More specifically, he turned to a subsection that exempts from distribution the fair market value of property acquired as a result of an exchange of property mentioned in subsection (1) rather than before. This is so because the house constituted an immoveable situated outside Saskatchewan. 7)Whether the respondent was able in principle to claim half the house pursuant to section 21 of the act, or to call the Vancouver house as a family home, was a more complex question, one that raised several issues. 8)","Disposition: Appeal Allowed [1] This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, S.S.1997, c.

With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. He argued the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of the spousal relationship, not before? Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) This appeal is the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell. Apart from being statute barred, the Act requires confirmation to be in writing and nothing has been produced. It has now been approximately 9 years. While Leith's income when he purchased the home was perhaps unexceptional, he has had substantial income for the last number of years and made no payments.  2) The Court considered the equivalent to Mitchell v.'s equivalent of the Mitchell case in which Mitchell was held to have been misapplied. It is not in light of the equitable considerations mentioned in s. 23(1)(a) and s. 21(2)(a), but rather supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) In this case, the trial judge erred in concluding that the values of the Vancouver house and its value fell to be exempt in distribution because the property had been acquired after commencing spousals. It follows that the property did not qualify for an exemption under s23(1(a). 4) The parties cohabitated with one another continuously for 2 years.

Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant recognized her obligation to contribute to her own support and continued her efforts to find employment. 2)Plelech does not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. It is expressly agreed by the parties that this settlement constitutes a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. 3)The principles of Pelech should not be used to restrict the application and purposes of s.17 of the Divorce Act. Where a person has negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled, the Court may exercise its relieving power. 4)The appellant had established that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur. Such changes in this context could not be considered radical unless they were permanent or substantially long-standing. There was truly finality to the agreement.","THE COURT: Appeal allowed without costs and the judgment and order of Hall, L.J.S.C. set aside per reasons for judgment of Jones, J.A.; Chipman, J.A. concurring by separate reasons and Hallett, J.A. dissenting. This is an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant\'s support from $2,000.00 to $1200.00 per month. The appeal should be allowed. One cannot say the trial judge erred in his assessment of the evidence respecting the respondent's ability to pay.",0.33112582781456956,0.47368421052631576,"This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. The parties separated in 1983. The respondent had remarried and continued to reside in the matrimonial home. There had been a significant drop in his income in the years prior to the agreement, which had resulted in several defaults in the husband's financial affairs. He applied to vary the amount of maintenance payable to the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that while there had been radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no connection between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant had demonstrated that there would be a gradual change in her circumstances, which would justify a variation of the maintenance payable.",0.3614457831325301

The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent.

2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent.

It may be that he had the consent of each child, but the fact remains that such conduct is wrong and should not be repeated. 3) The respondent was awarded one-half of the $4,237.16 payable for child support for 2005 and 2006 based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) There was no retroactive variation of the order dated June 29, 2004 which stipulated that the respondent pay monthly child support of $500 for three children commencing July 1, 2004. On five occasions the petitioner failed to attend as directed with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip. This amounted to material change and should be retroactive to that date.",0.5569948186528496

It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his behalf in the event the prosecution insisted on proceeding with a trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to a fair trial. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged of possession for the purpose of trafficking and he has failed to meet the second criterion of being indigent. He has made no effort to obtain financing or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel. The Court found that the accused is unlikely to conduct his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. He comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel and, therefore, it is important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements.  1) The Court was satisfied from the information and material placed before the accused that he probably does not have the ability to conduct himself own defence given the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge or charges against the accused and the fact that he may not be able to pay his legal fees in the amount of $2,500 per month. There is a cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to the potential trial that will enable the accused, if he so chooses, to attempt to make arrangements for counsel making periodic payments over the ensuing months to defend himself. 2) There are two germane criteria an accused must demonstrate in order to qualify for a court appointed lawyer: that he is unable to afford counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer; and that representation is essential to fair trial performance. The essence of the application is that he wishes to have lawyer appointed by the court to represent him at his trial. It is my understanding that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1)of the Charter, in which the prosecution insists on proceeding in breach thereof. The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority","[27] I am satisfied from the information and material placed before me that Mr. Regnier is probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction.

At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit.

The accused was denied access to the court, and the matter was adjourned so that the accused could inquire into whether he could obtain a bank loan through court services or equity in real property. At trial, the Court will consider whether the accused has demonstrated the requisite circumstance of being indigent, and whether any conditions should be placed upon the appointment.HELD: The accused is out of luck. The Court of Appeal set forth protocol for an accused individual to pursue in seeking court- appointed counsel in cases not falling within the provincial Legal Aid plan. The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority. Only in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as an accused is the Court required to make an order appointing counsel. If no financial institution was prepared to provide him with funding utilizing his equity as a security, that might well cast a different light upon the question of his indigency. The essence of the accused's application is that he wishes counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer. It is his understanding that a private lawyer would charge him thousands of dollars up front as retainer and as he has no savings and very little disposable income, he cannot afford to retain a lawyer. The cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to the potential trial will also enable the accused to attempt to secure funding utilizing this significant equity in his home.","[27] I am satisfied from the information and material placed before me that Mr. Regnier is probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, questioned the validity of it, and claimed his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Crown could adduce evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the warrant, and to countenance subsequent validation. There was no evidence before the court as to the extent that the ITO could be used to approximate or amplify the evidence seized by the search.  1) The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors made by the investigators, but which were done in good faith and not with an intent to deceive or mislead. This practice has since changed. 2) None of the accused's testimony in the original ITO was admissible in respect of whether his Charter rights were violated. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be a countenance further validation.  3) The ITO is a separate proceeding from the trial proper and the evidence taken on voir net forms no part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. 4) In reviewing the sufficiency of a warrant application, the court must recognize (along with investigative necessity) the two principles of prior authorization and probable grounds, the verification of which may require a close examination of the information available to the police at the time of the application for wiretap, in considering the jurisprudence on which it was presented to the justice of the peace. The approach set out to erroneous information in an affidavit on a wiretap application attempts to reconcile these principles.","[1] The accused has applied for relief pursuant to ss. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter] to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant.

The court found that the accused had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the defence of his s. 8 Charter rights.

The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor errors in the drafting of their affidavit material. The practice in 2013 was not necessarily to review the warrant prior to completing his forensic examination. This practice has since changed. 2)There was insufficient evidence at the hearing to establish a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the Internet history or the presence of any actual messages between the complainant and the accused.

The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, questioned the validity of it, and claimed his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Crown could adduce evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the warrant, and to countenance subsequent validation. There was no evidence before the court as to the extent that the ITO could be used to approximate or amplify the evidence seized by the search.  1) The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors made by the investigators, but which were done in good faith and not with an intent to deceive or mislead. This practice has since changed. 2) None of the accused's testimony in the original ITO was admissible in respect of whether his Charter rights were violated. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be a countenance further validation.  3) The ITO is a separate proceeding from the trial proper and the evidence taken on voir net forms no part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. 4) In reviewing the sufficiency of a warrant application, the court must recognize (along with investigative necessity) the two principles of prior authorization and probable grounds, the verification of which may require a close examination of the information available to the police at the time of the application for wiretap, in considering the jurisprudence on which it was presented to the justice of the peace. The approach set out to erroneous information in an affidavit on a wiretap application attempts to reconcile these principles.",0.4286995515695068

There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.

The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure, which would indicate that there had been an attack on the complainant. The Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the dog had been attacked by the complainant, and it was open to the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he took reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. HELD: The accused was fined $200. On the definition of attack, as understand it, the offence is an unrequested confrontation of human by dog made in circumstances where the dog exhibits loud and angry-sounding barks, snarls, growls and makes within close range of the human. The dog's actions might have justified a hearing under the other section of The Animal Disease and Protection Act with respect to detection and control of rabies, but in this case the accused did not take reasonable steps. There are seven specific pieces of evidence that back up the conclusion the accused failed to act reasonably on these four occasions. 1) the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady that was attending a garage sale. 2) the owner of the residence had either gotten the dog off its logging chain leash or had his daughter get into her vehicle and drove away before the dog got any closer. There was clear evidence that on the occasion when the complainant's daughter was in her back alley the dog escaped from her house and then ran through the garbage cans enclosure. The Court was of the view, in light of what the Crown had proved, that there were no reasonable steps taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself.","[1] Sheldon Federuik is charged that between the 9th of September and the 25th of September, 2001, at Nipawin, Saskatchewan, he did own a dog, to wit, that without provocation attacks a person, contrary to s. 135.3(3) of The Urban Municipalities Act. [5] If a dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show that the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but on the evidence in this case I find that on all four dates there was no intrusion which was sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered as provocation, even if Mr. Saretzky had not conceded the point. [12] And dealing then with that latter matter, whether Mr. Federuik had taken reasonable steps on any of these occasions to ensure that his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s. 135.3(3) of The Urban Municipality Act, in my opinion it’s irrelevant at law that after a dog attacks it responds to its owner’s commands.

This does not constitute a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra nor one that the Court had sympathy for in Forsyth, supra.",0.5415929203539822
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault, including touching a person under the age of 14 years with a part of his body contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and two counts of touching directly or with an object contrary to the same s. 151 of the Code. The accused and his family lived in the same neighbourhood as the complainant, which is not far from Dartmouth. The Crown argued that the four counts related to the complainant's reliability, reliability, impartiality or honesty. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all four counts. 1) The accused had been in common-law relationship with the complainant. He had been living with her. They would have been between 10 to 15 and 11 to 16 years old respectively during the most relevant time periods herein. 2) There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household lived for what period of time, which has implications for where and when the alleged incidents are to have taken place. 3) There were a number of incidents that reflected the accused's 'ongoing sexual interest' in the girl. The essential elements of Sexual assault were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. In this case, the Crown sought to establish that the accused, who had been charged with the same counts, had intentionally touched the complainant and her sister, who considered him an uncle, by way of an invitation, incitement or counseling to do physical or sexual harm to her. The complainant had been 12 at the time of the alleged offences. 4) The Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any of the offences. The Court was unable to determine whether the accused intended the victim to receive a sexual communication as an invite, induce, induce or sexual gesture from him or her, or if he intended her to believe that he had a sexual relationship with her and, in some cases, to allow her to experience the sensation of being touched directly or indirectly by him.","[1] This decision will address whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. H. is guilty of sexual offences involving SG. Mr. H. [DOB January 4, 1968] is charged with four counts as follows:

1. That he between the 16 day of October 1999 and the first day of April 2009 at or near Dartmouth... did unlawfully commit a sexual assault on SG contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code;

2. that he between 16 day of October 1999 and the first day of May 2008, did for a sexual purpose touch SG, a person under the age of 14 years, with a part of his body - the tongue and hands... contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code;

In addition to the four counts concerning the alleged touching, the court also considered the fact that the complainant was between 10 and 15 years old at the time of the offence, and whether the accused intended the victim to receive the communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, coupled with knowing the communication was for sexual purpose. The accused was also charged with two counts relating the sexual assaults of the two children.

The Crown argued that the accused's evidence was not credible since the complainant did not immediately scream out when she was touched, or report any of the incidents to other persons shortly thereafter, she kept going back to visit her father, who lived with the accused, even after these incidents had occurred, and repeatedly put herself at risk by allowing herself to be alone with him.

The other child was between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the alleged offences. 2) He lived in a house full of people all the time.

The court would make no comment on the merits of the appellant's intended submissions to that court or in any event regarding the reference to access in the Private Guardianship Order or access provision within the meaning of s.78(6) of the Act. Finally, the parties were not precluded from raising the issue before the Court of Appeal if it was necessary.","Held: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Bateman, J.A.; Roscoe and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring. [21] I would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the appellant’s affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing (paras. 6, 7 and 8) and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. However, I am satisfied that she had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. However, I am satisfied that allowing the appeal and remitting the matter is consistent with the child’s best interests. It is, in my view, in the child’s best interests that her birth mother’s wish to have access be determined on the application to adopt. [26] I would allow the appeal, set aside the adoption order and remit the adoption application to a judge of the Family Division.",0.4184782608695652,0.5384615384615384,"The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of their temporary guardianship order in Alberta. In 2005, an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child, the appellant temporarily re-located to Calgary and put herself forward as a potential adoptive parent. On the same day that this permanent guardianhip order was granted, it was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order, under which the respondents became the guardians of the child. The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. The appellant appealed that order. She sought fresh evidence limited to portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Section 83 of the Act permits an appeal of an adoption order. The judge was entitled to dispense with the mother's consent if she did not appear at the hearing. However, the court was satisfied that she had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. The right to be heard is a principle of natural justice and the test for admission of fresh evidence on appeal was set out by McIntyre, J., writing for the Supreme Court of Canada. By allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the application court, it would be appropriate to decide whether the reference to access in the private guardianhip Order is an 'access order' or 'access provision' within the meaning of s.78(6) of the act. 2)The court would make no comment on the merits or that she's intended submissions to that court. Additionally, the Court will decide whether to grant the appellant a hearing.",0.5415860735009672

Each operates independently of the other except to the extent that the Minister's final involvement is contingent on a judicial order for committal. Neither engages in the other's area of responsibility. Neither reviews the other’s determination or decision.  4)The Act is a modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extrad hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case. The extradition procedure is based upon a treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has a fair and just criminal system. Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the performance of our obligations under extradition treaties, is vested in the executive.

HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation.

The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position.

The question is too vague to answer In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. HELD: 1)The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger.  2)There is no doubt that the offender fits the criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time. The only real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than a more serious dangerous offender designation.  3)There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault against his estranged wife and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed. If he refuses to do so, his risk for future violence will be high. He appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and does not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life and in his potential for violent crimes in the future.","[1] Albert Trevor Peters (the “offender”) pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common‑law partner contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. However, it seems to me that he should be given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming. In my opinion, Mr. Peters is a high risk to re‑offend violently and sexually violently [sic] in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. Therefore, it is, in my opinion, an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? Analysis A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? The offence of aggravated assault is clearly a “serious personal injury offence” in that it is an indictable offence and involves the use of violence against another person in which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years. [40] The Crown has proven that the offender committed “serious personal injury offence” on November 4, 2006, within the meaning of s. 752(a) and, accordingly, this threshold requirement has been met. B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? [46] Nonetheless, I find that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). The offender has demonstrated a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour culminating in serious assaults on women. C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? [50] Accordingly, having found the offender to have met the dangerous offender criteria, I must, nonetheless, consider the application of the long‑term offender provisions and utilize that option if the offender meets the long‑term offender criteria and there is a reasonable possibility that the offender’s risk to reoffend could be acceptably managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). [57] The offender has never been sentenced to periods of incarceration which resulted in him being placed in a federal penitentiary and thus, has not been offered the kind of programming available via the federal penitentiary system. D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? [68] Given all of the circumstances and all of the principles of sentencing that I must apply, I conclude that a seven‑year sentence is a fit and proper sentence for the determinate portion of the sentence. I am prepared to go along with the submission of counsel and provide a one‑for‑one credit for the time that the offender has spent in pre‑sentence custody. Giving the offender three years eight months credit towards his seven‑year sentence results in a further period of incarceration of three years four months. Conclusion [82] I find the offender Albert Trevor Peters to be a long­‑term offender. The appropriate determinate sentence for the charge of aggravated assault in these circumstances is seven years in prison. He ought to get credit for time spent on remand of three years eight months, which results in a sentence of three years four months in prison.",0.4259438528557599,0.5256570713391739,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.

HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender was 52 years old and had a single, dated conviction. The issue was whether there was a reasonable possibility that he could eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than the more serious dangerous offender designation. HELD: The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger.  1)The offender has serious health problems. As result of a congenital heart disease, he required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had a stroke. He has been entirely unresponsive to treatment and in considering his risk for future violence, his risk is high. 2)There are two additional events that are germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed by a psychiatrist. In reviewing his case file, it is pertinent to note that the offender has expressed a desire to continue working in scaffolding and that he has expressed an interest in working with other people in his life. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is able to determine the probable nature, frequency, and severity of any future violence caused by the offender because he has not taken the kinds of programming available via the Federal Penitentiary System and because there is a reasonable prospect that he will continue to perpetrate acts of violence such as these despite having completed significant remedial efforts and being in good health.","[1] Albert Trevor Peters (the “offender”) pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common‑law partner contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. However, it seems to me that he should be given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming. In my opinion, Mr. Peters is a high risk to re‑offend violently and sexually violently [sic] in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. Therefore, it is, in my opinion, an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? Analysis A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? The offence of aggravated assault is clearly a “serious personal injury offence” in that it is an indictable offence and involves the use of violence against another person in which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years. [40] The Crown has proven that the offender committed “serious personal injury offence” on November 4, 2006, within the meaning of s. 752(a) and, accordingly, this threshold requirement has been met. B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? [46] Nonetheless, I find that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). The offender has demonstrated a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour culminating in serious assaults on women. C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? [50] Accordingly, having found the offender to have met the dangerous offender criteria, I must, nonetheless, consider the application of the long‑term offender provisions and utilize that option if the offender meets the long‑term offender criteria and there is a reasonable possibility that the offender’s risk to reoffend could be acceptably managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). [57] The offender has never been sentenced to periods of incarceration which resulted in him being placed in a federal penitentiary and thus, has not been offered the kind of programming available via the federal penitentiary system. D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? [68] Given all of the circumstances and all of the principles of sentencing that I must apply, I conclude that a seven‑year sentence is a fit and proper sentence for the determinate portion of the sentence. I am prepared to go along with the submission of counsel and provide a one‑for‑one credit for the time that the offender has spent in pre‑sentence custody. Giving the offender three years eight months credit towards his seven‑year sentence results in a further period of incarceration of three years four months. Conclusion [82] I find the offender Albert Trevor Peters to be a long­‑term offender. The appropriate determinate sentence for the charge of aggravated assault in these circumstances is seven years in prison. He ought to get credit for time spent on remand of three years eight months, which results in a sentence of three years four months in prison.",0.4552845528455285,0.5429553264604811,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.

HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants.

To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties or at least give a preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy.

S.41(b) recognizes an exception where the cause of action, in substance, is addressed by the legislation and collective agreement, and the extent to which the court's assumption of jurisdiction would be consistent or inconsistent with that scheme. 3)There was no question that in substance the dispute, the dispute was one of the legislation, not collective agreement matters. It was not suggested or contemplated that neither the court nor the parties had jurisdiction in the subject matter. The principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal apply. 4)In addressing the limits of court jurisdiction, including where the union declines to proceed with an individual employee's grievance or settles it against the employee's wishes, the court is to inquire into the complaint and to do all things necessary to ensure compliance with s.34. The plaintiff's rights as police officers under the Police Act are individual as opposed to collective rights. Whether the Order violated terms and conditions of employment once an application for certification was made pursuant to the collective agreements is a matter to be resolved having regard to the procedures for such a resolution established in the applicable labour relations legislation. 5)The plaintiff's claim that s.41 and 42 of the TPUA did not apply to them because they were employees of the plaintiff's bargaining unit but rather constituted former police personnel of various municipal units and at the time negotiations for a collective agreement commenced in 1996, they were not employees of HRM at all. 6)The statements of claim should not be struck out.

The Act provided that individual contracts/rights (whether pre-existing or not) are fully replaced by the collective agreement and the Union's status as exclusive bargaining agent under the Trade Union Act. The collective agreement does, however, include a provision for non-police officers. HRM and MAPP had commenced collective agreement negotiations in 1996 and, prior to signing the agreement, they were not employees of the police force. In 1997, MAPP became part of the bargaining unit represented by MAPP. In 1998, the parties signed a collective agreement which incorporated the findings of the Interest Arbitration Award, including the classifications of Sergeant and Sergeant. In 1999, the plaintiff police officers were reduced in rank to the rank of Sergeant after negotiations for collective agreement commenced. In 2001, the police officer joined the MAPP bargaining unit as part of MAPP as a member of that bargaining unit. The plaintiff officers were not union members but were subject to the terms and condition of their employment contracts.

The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The Board of Police Commissioners declined to consider the matter on the basis it had no jurisdiction to convene an investigation or inquiry since there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. The Intervenor, on the other hand, submitted that the Commission had jurisdiction to investigate the matter. Dismissing the action, that the substance of the dispute was a dispute over the meaning of the Police Act and Regulations. The Act provided that individual contracts/rights (whether pre-existing or not) are fully replaced by the collective agreement and the Union's status as exclusive bargaining agent under the Trade Union Act. The collective agreement does, however, include a provision for non-police officers. HRM and MAPP had commenced collective agreement negotiations in 1996 and, prior to signing the agreement, they were not employees of the police force. In 1997, MAPP became part of the bargaining unit represented by MAPP. In 1998, the parties signed a collective agreement which incorporated the findings of the Interest Arbitration Award, including the classifications of Sergeant and Sergeant. In 1999, the plaintiff police officers were reduced in rank to the rank of Sergeant after negotiations for collective agreement commenced. In 2001, the police officer joined the MAPP bargaining unit as part of MAPP as a member of that bargaining unit. The plaintiff officers were not union members but were subject to the terms and condition of their employment contracts. They were reduced to serge after MAPP made a demand for their consent for any change to terms and conditions of employment. MAPP and the plaintiffs brought an action against MAPP for failure to represent. They argued that s. 41 and 42 of the TUA do not apply, because the cause of action pre-date the union agreement, and because the statutory freeze contained in the Act did not preclude the plaintiff pursuing any common law rights in the courts or that the exclusivity of bargaining agent provisions in the union were not applicable because the plaintiffs' rights as police officers are individual as opposed to collective rights, these are matters that involve the threshold question of whether the question is itself arbitrable. HELD: The Statement of Claim should not be struck out. The Court of Appeal adopted and held scrupulously to an exclusive jurisdiction model in respect to the interpretation and application of collective",0.4460856720827179

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner argued that his mother no longer available to provide child care during his access weekends. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)Once a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the children, pursuant to s. 14(a) of the Act, the issue of child support ought to be revisited. The evidence suggested that there had been some change in the respondent's circumstances. It did not satisfy the Court that there was any material change in his circumstances. 2)The respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided him with 'gifts' as he describes them. His father passed away prior to the pre-trial conference. The allegation is that he has received no gifts since then and his mother is not able to afford to help him. Without evidence of the earlier gifts, there was no means of comparing the present circumstance to the past. 3)The parties agreed upon the imputation of income (the respondent's income in 1998 was $43,209.40 and his income in 2000 was $44,386). 4)They agreed upon a specified access amount based upon his income. The parties each provided their own tax returns showing their taxable income at the time of the agreement. The material does not change the fact that there has been no change in their circumstances. The matter has been posed in a material manner in the manner requested. Once again, the Court cannot rely upon either party's ability to provide cogent and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances.","As a result there will be an order that the petitioner is not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent. There will further be an order that if the respondent chooses not to exercise access during any of his specified access times he is to provide seven days' written notice to the petitioner.

The material does not satisfy the Court that there have been any changes in his circumstances since the pre-trial conference. There has been no material change."" 2)The respondent was to pay the petitioner an amount that was different from the amount that would be determined in accordance with the applicable guidelines. If the level of child support was simply an agreed upon amount the question was whether there had been a material change within the meaning, means, needs or other circumstances of either spouse or of any child who is entitled to support pursuant to s.15.1(3) of the Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Section 15 of the Act provides for an order requiring a spouse to pay for the support of any or all children of the marriage. This application was brought just ten months after the Pre-trial Conference. It is evident from the affidavit material filed by both parties that there is a substantial and ongoing conflict between them which affects their ability to make arrangements with respect to the parenting provisions in the agreement. 3)The parties agreed to impute income of the respondent to be imputed in the table amount based upon his imputed income. His taxable income in 1998 was $44,386 and in 1999 it was estimated at $40,386, and in 2000 it was anticipated that it would rise to $48,000 by the time the judge made his variation order in 2000. There had not been material change to either his taxable income or his circumstances as a result of either of the parties' failure to pay child support in the manner requested. There would be material change if the amount was varied. The alternative is that it is simply an ordered varying, rescinding or suspending, prospectively or retroactively, (a) support order or any provision thereof on application by either or both former spouses or by any other person.","As a result there will be an order that the petitioner is not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent.

A written victim impact statement was filed by the accused on behalf of the victim and the defendant also filed as exhibit a photo of the accused. The defendant minimized his involvement and culpability for the offence, and made an order in Form 5.03 authorizing the taking of the number of samples that were reasonably required for the examination. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, plus a fine of $1,500.00 plus one year probation with strict conditions.  1) The aggravating factors in this case were that the accused participated in gratuitous violence without any real explanation for doing so. 2) The nature of the offence itself is aggravating. The accused minimized his responsibility for his actions in the pre-sentence report and the fact that the assault occurred at his home. The Court found that a fine would be appropriate, but only if the accused paid a victim impact surcharge of $225.00. 3) Taking into consideration both the aggravating and mitigating factors, the principles of sentencing, the facts and the circumstances, the court could not conclude that incarceration in a facility is an appropriate disposition in the circumstances. The principles of justice, s. 732.1(5), and s. parity demand similar sentences. In this case, the offence was committed against a person who had been employed consistently for all but two years since his fifteenth birthday. He is a father and has accepted his responsibility to be financial and emotional support for his daughter.","[1] The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm on Wallace Flood on August 27, 2006 contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.

The Court of Justice agreed with the parties that this amount should be increased to $20,000. The real issue between the parties appears to be in respect to the factors to be considered when the children were attending university and how this would affect the Guideline amounts payable.

As the sum of $500 per month has been paid in the interim pursuant to my order of December 17, 2007, any such payments made shall be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support for Keegan, and then towards the arrears.",0.5525982256020279,0.5617283950617284,"FIAT: On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agree that given the age of the children, and their change in the amount of support payable by the respondent, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for the two children directly to the respondent so that the children no longer qualify as a child of that marriage within that meaning. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the Age of majority. It can now be stated that the following three steps need to be addressed: firstly towards the ongoing child support for the children; secondly towards the arrears; and finally towards the balance of the payments necessary to meet the parties' obligations to pay the child support payable in the event that the parties cannot meet the required level of support by the time the children are registered with the province; secondly, to enable the respondent to pay support in an appropriate fashion. In this case the respondent is to pay $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expenses for support of Keegan. Based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,781 and the income of his wife, $90,628, the amount payable by him to be paid towards Keegan is $10,587. The Court of Justice agreed with the parties that this amount should be increased to $20,000. The real issue between the parties appears to be in respect to the factors to be considered when the children were attending university and how this would affect the Guideline amounts payable. It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post-secondary education program may result in a child over a age of majority qualifying as a 'child' within this meaning. As success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs.",0.5617283950617284

The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v.

It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The issue of whether the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with holiday pay was severed from the jury and left in reserve until the Court of Appeal renders its decision. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. Even if the plaintiff was entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct in this regard. 2)There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with. The first issue was whether the plaintiff could rely on the presumption arising out of the LSA, which is that holiday pay should not be based on his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. As such, it would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse his actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage, his salary and the truck allowance at the time of his dismissal. 3)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday compensation for the 10 years. It would be substantially prejudiced if the defendant was now allowed to assert that right. 4)HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $19,000 for bad conduct for the period April 1988 to October 1997. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination (which would have arisen within the statutory period of 6 years), the plaintiff also received $1,000 in holiday pay as a share of his salary.","[2] The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant.

In addition to this claim, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. 2)The plaintiff was hired by the defendant in 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park. Prior to being hired, he was paid $45,000 per year comprised of salary, salary, benefits and one-half of his truck allowance. The defendant argued holiday pay should not be included in any computation of holiday pay, as the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff would be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage. 3)There were several preliminary issues to be dealt with.

In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination (which would have arisen within the statutory period of 6 years), the plaintiff also received $1,000 in holiday pay as a share of his salary.",0.5183788878416588
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.

HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.

The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to me.

The issues on appeal are whether SGI correctly calculated Montgrand's income and whether Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 121 of the Act. 3) The trial judge erred in holding that the income replacement fund (IRB) for the respondent as a whole is to be calculated in accordance with the standard approach used by SGI. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's (TSB) IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. 4) The hearing judge's interpretation conflicts with the provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, particularly s. 24(1) thereof.","It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner’s IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. 15) Therefore, I must conclude that SGI has correctly calculated Montgrand’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find Montgrand’s net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB.",0.37597911227154046,0.5948103792415169,"The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate a non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to me. Counsel for the appellant and SGI have agreed that the calculation is correct. 2) SGI has correctly calculated the respondent's net income when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. 3) The Act and Regulations contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal.

Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed.

Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period and is properly regulated through arbitration. The employer appealed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. At issue was whether the letter of July 22, 1994 was an ancillary document and whether it forms part of the collective agreement. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application; the appeal was directed to the arbitrator and directed that the action be stayed pending submission to arbitration as provided for by the in-laws. There were four considerations that supported the conclusion that, where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration.","THE COURT: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; The employer applied to Cacchione, J., in Chambers, to strike out the Union\'s statement of claim on the ground that the union\'s claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
