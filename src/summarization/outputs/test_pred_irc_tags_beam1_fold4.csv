Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent.

The respondent acted in her jurisdiction."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which overturned the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant had been living in the home of her stepfather for the past 15 years. She applied for assistance as a stay of execution pending the birth of her son. The respondent's stepfather refused to provide assistance, arguing that the mother was not entitled to the assistance. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in misapprehending the municipal social benefits scheme and M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5 in particular."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel disburse funds from mortgage advances made to various creditors. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged were in fact in fact written by him. The plaintiff had also received a letter of direction from the defendant that stated that he would disburse the funds to the creditors. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiff disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocables letter of directions. The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The Charter rights were upheld. The picketing prohibition term of the release of the accused was reasonably-justified as a condition of his release from custody. The Justice ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice. The Court was satisfied in the circumstances and nature of the case that the picketing ban term was reasonably justified as condition of release of him from custody on a condition that he be detained on the basis that there would be a substantial increase in the likelihood that the offender would commit an offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files and were preparing to file a statement of claim. The deceased plaintiff had not explained why she waited five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from the Judge. The SGI notes produced from the SGI indicated that the Lavoie firm was continuing to represent the plaintiff some six months after the initial consultation, and were preparation to file statement of claims.

1996canlii5602.txt,"The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom.. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The Crown had obtained full-time employment with the Armed Forces for six months. The respondent had, by the time of sentencing, obtained full time employment with a full-timer. He had, in the interim, obtained employment with an employment opportunity. The sentencing judge was obviously persuaded that there was more hope for rehabilitation if he was able to continue the sessions with his psychiatrist. The trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff was a member of the jury in a sexual assault trial. The defendant broadcast news about the alleged assault at the plaintiff's roller rink. The plaintiff's radio station was the only one in the city that reported the news. The court found that the defendant had published the news that it received from the police. The trial judge found that there was no evidence that the news was false, malicious, dishonest or recklessly published. The defendants' newscast was broadcast by the police and was found to be accurate. The Court found that it was not the police's job to report the news to the public but rather the defendant's. The police had been called to the plaintiff property several times and the defendant was not required to provide any information to the court. The evidence was that the 12 year old girl was accosted while sitting on the curb near the Roller Rink. The 12 year olds were dragged by the two juvenile offenders from the curb to the street where they sat. The video of the incident was never requested by the plaintiff and it was destroyed, regretfully, due to an administrative error. The jury found that neither the defendant nor the plaintiff was negligent in their reporting of the news and found that they had published it in error."

The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for two years. They had two children, Paul and Alexander. The parties separated in 1996. The respondent sought to set aside a corollary relief judgment based upon the separation agreement. The appellant argued that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident agreement to alleviate the suffering of the appellant. The corollaries relief judgment was granted in February 1997. The petitioner appealed the Corollary Relief judgment. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant had not shown that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreements at the time of the divorce proceeding. The Corollaries Relief judgment was upheld. The Court held that the respondent had not demonstrated that she could not have made a reasonable decision at the relevant time."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.

The deceased had been granted a decree of divorce from the deceased. The decree gave her custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The Will was admitted to Probate. The applicant objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate. She contends the applicant has no standing. HELD: The application was granted. The respondent will assert her right to recover arrears of maintenance pursuant to the order of November 1972. She will assert the right to discharge of the order pursuant pursuant to S.56. The court will determine whether it would be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned. 1)The respondent will defend the action and assert her rights to discharge the order under s. 56 of the EMOA. The application fails to be determined upon s.55 of the Act. The question for resolution in whether it is 'gross' and inequititable' to refuse an application and if such an Order can be justified in so as the Respondent is concerned is whether such a order can only be'simplyified' by the respondent. 2)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. The maintenance order is a charge on the land. The Court will determine if it would in the words of the section be 'grossly unfair' from a perspective to decline the application. 3)The applicant purports to bring this application on behalf. Even though she is nether the executrix named in the Will nor a beneficiary, the application is dismissed. The will has not been admitted to probate."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The appellant's evidentiary burden was not raised. While the trial judge may have been referring to the evidentiary burdens he went further and stated that he had not raise a reasonable suspicion on the entire of the information. With respect to the appellant, the trial Judge went further. He went further stating that the appeal was a fundamental error of law and the Crown is entitled to rely on the presumption of accuracy. 2)The appeal was denied and a fresh trial ordered on the basis that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the evidentia burden."
1998canlii13455.txt,"FIAT. At issue was what evidence of a prior action could be put before the jury. The trial was imminent. HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The respondent's prior medical records were examined for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination. After reviewing the authorities, the judge held that the terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the applicant's claim. HELD: The terms of settlement were not disclosed nor was the release completed part and parcel of the agreement. Beyond the issue of privilege, the more critical problem was the more important problem of revisiting the action. The sum paid by the respondent against the prior defendant was not a new allegation but rather a series of allegations made by the defendant against the new defendant."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner. At trial, both parties were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home. The final paragraph of the judgment reads: ""[18] The court has ordered that Stella is entitled to exclusive possession of the home, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for Mike to move from the matrionial home. If necessary, the court is prepared to provide directions in that regard."" HELD: The issue resolved around the interpretation of two subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal. Rule 15 applies where the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore it is not stayed by the notice of appeal."

The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleged that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. The applicant applied to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application for leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court was granted. The application was granted on the basis that the respondent had not met the threshold required by the Act to establish prima facie claims for contribution or liability. The respondent had already established a prima fusi for contribution and indemnity. The court held that the pre-trial process was procedural in nature. The pre- trial process was not necessary to assess evidence or go into possible defences at this stage. The third party claim and the pleadings on file could well be sufficient for this purpose. To attain uniformity, it seems reasonable on an application for leaving under s7 to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant."
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused made an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness requested that the Court enter into a voir dire. The voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter were infringed. The accused was found not to be in breach of his right to a fair trial and the Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court found the accused was not in breach because his continued detention after the purported un-ar arrest constituted a de facto arrest. The Crown did not call the witnesses on the voir se. The court found that there was an actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention which was transformed into an arrest."

The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public. The accused was stopped behind the officer at a red light at a busy intersection. The officer locked in the vehicle speed at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour. The vehicle accelerated for two to three blocks and the officer locked the vehicle in what appeared to be the accused's greatest speed at 1 hundred and 40 km/hour in a sixty kilometre zone. The speed was a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. The driver was guilty as charged. While the speed was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a marked a departure from what a reasonably responsible driver would observe in the accused’s circumstances. The driving was a departure form the standard of care expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The defendant was guilty of driving dangerously. The court found that the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on a stretch of road. While it was a'marked departure' from the Standard expected for reasonable prudent drivers, the conduct was a “marked departure” from the acceptable standard expected."

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The Union applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party or as an amicus curiae or as intervener and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1998. The Union was not joined as a parties to the action but was not a party to the proceedings. The union opposed all of the applications. The court reviewed the history of the Union and found that it had jurisdiction to add a party for the purpose of launching an appeal, such authority arising from the provisions of the Judicature Act. The Court found that the Union was neither a party nor an intervener by virtue of the fact that it was not an intervenor by order of the Supreme Court. The only remedy was to have the Union's solicitor serve as an interlocutor or as party to an application for joinder. The application was dismissed. The parties were not joined by the Union as a Party or as a intervener.

2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of his mother and the plaintiff had given it to her. The funds were to be divided equally between the plaintiff's four children. The defendant claimed that the written instructions to the plaintiff constituted the establishment of a trust. HELD: The plaintiff was the litigation guardian of his four children and the defendant became the trustee for the sum. The court held the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust unless it appeared that there was an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer. The incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a trust unless the plaintiff appears to have declared a trust and not only to make the transfer."

The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","This was an appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. The claim involved the question of whether something affixed to a realty is fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial) had acquired title to house property and caused to be affixed by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for the purpose of a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for their disabled foster child. The Abilities Council wanted the wheelchair lift back but San Diego negotiated a purchase for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. Although it was not a finding of the trial judge the manner in which it was determined, although it was a finding the trial court judge the intention of the parties was a prime factor in determining whether something that affixed the real estate becomes a part of the realt, although the intention was a factor in deciding whether something is affixed thereto becomes a realt. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The wheelchair lift never became part of a real estate notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention either party that it become part of it and the intention is a prime factors in determining if something affined to the property becomes a piece of the property. Furthermore, although there was not an evidence on the facts, the trial Judge dismissed the claim against the third parties on the evidence as found by the Provincial Court Judge."

2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","The court fixed costs in a 4 day proceeding where the plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant was justified in contesting the plaintiff's claim as it did and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs were increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. The plaintiff's evidence was accepted, however, and the trial extended over 4 days.

The mother later unilaterally moved from Bridgewater to Halifax, frustrating the access provisions of the interim order. The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties were to share joint custody of the children. The respondent was to have access with the children every Tuesday and Wednesday from after school until after school. The parties had been married for seven years and separated in 2002. The children went to school, had after school activities and had a doctor's appointment. The mother was to move to Bridgewater to live with the father. The father was to continue to pay child support. The court reviewed the circumstances and found that it was in the children's best interests to remain in the father's residential care beyond the end of the school year. The Court also varied the order for child support payable by the respondent to reflect his current income."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing a street outside of a crosswalk when the Crown called three witnesses. The Crown called four witnesses, including the complainant, who was standing with their infant daughter. The defence called the complainant's husband, who had just come out of Super Store, to assist the officer. The officer asked the complainant if he could assist the complainant and the complainant backed up to speak with the officer, who then backed up and struck him. The police officer testified that he did not raise his hands or raise his hand. The defendant's vehicle did not move very short distance forward before striking the complainant; the Crown's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to the officer or the Crown, locked upon striking the officer; the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the victim. The court found that the accused drove careless. The Court found that both the complainant’s and the Crown’ s witnesses’ statements to the effect that the complainant was not shouting at the officer were not inconsistent. The issue was whether the Crown had proved that the defendant drove without due attention and care. The trial judge found that his vehicle rolled over only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The vehicle rolled into the complainant directly in front of the police vehicle. The pedestrian crossing road adjacent to a parking lot was a pedestrian crossing. The intersection was directly in the complainant area. The collision occurred within a short time. The impact on the complainant wasn't so minor that the Crown could reasonably conclude that the driver was careless."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, operate a vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s.8 and s9 of the Charter of Rights. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the accused was impaired. The Court found that the evidence of an officer who had not been convinced of the accused's impairment as a prerequisite to the breath demand was insufficient. The Evidence of the Officer, which was insufficient insufficient to show a belief in impairment as required to a demand, could alone prove impairment driving beyond the reasonable doubt; the evidence does not support an honest belief. The court found that there was no subjective honest evidence on the officer that she was impaired at the time she made the breath request. The issue was whether the accused could operate a Motor Vehicle while impaired by the alcohol or drugs. The police officer was unsure of whether the complainant had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was nothing new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 a. m. to justify the breath refusal. The Crown did not establish that the officer had reasonable and reasonable grounds for the breath seizure demand. The defence argued that the certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breathalyszer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The certificate of analysis should not have been admissible as it was insufficiently supported a belief that impairment as pre-condition to a request to operate the motor vehicle. The respondent's defence argued the certificate was not admissible due to the officer's failure to take judicial notice of the fact that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment than she would been at the moment in time when she was parking the truck. The trial judge concluded that the respondent's own testimony that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the same time was not enough to prove impaired."

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

2_2007skqb444.txt,"The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code. HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were convicted of robbery with violence and assault with a weapon. The accuseds had been in custody since January 2007 and had been on remand for 20 months. The Crown had previously applied for a capital sentence in this case. The court of appeal increased the sentence to two years less a day for the date of appeal. The sentence was based on the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence, the defendant's lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offences, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the city, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. The sentences were appropriate in the circumstances. The two accuseds' criminal records were appalling. The Court of Appeal gave them one credit for time served on remands which was 20 months and the sentence was reduced to two for one credit to be served in a federal penitentiary. The victim surcharge was waived. The offender's record as an adult consists of a conviction for driving while impaired and a conviction of having their faces masked. The offences were committed when the accuseds lived in Regina. The convictions were made in 2007 and 2008. The sentencing guidelines were set out in s. 718 and 718. The Criminal Code provides that a person convicted of a robbery is liable to imprisonment for life. For the offence that masking one's face with intent to commit an indictable offence, person can be sentenced to term not exceeding ten years. The offence of armed robbery is a serious and violent crime. The maximum sentence for each offence is two years imprisonment. The amount of time served is reduced to 2 years."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claimed $25,000 for damages for a house sale claim. The claim alleged that the plaintiff failed to disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The plaintiff alleged that there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. The defendant claimed the plaintiff did not disclose that it had flooded previously. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the claim was not credible. The Court concluded that the defendant's disclosure statement did not adequately disclose the history of repeated flooding. The judge found that there were no errors in the disclosure statement and the plaintiff was not liable for any damages."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. In all of the circumstances of this case, the appellant was prejudiced by the questions. The question of the appellant's prior convictions was introduced by counsel for the defence during the appellant’s examination-in-chief. The defence did not object to the questions and the appellant did not raise any of them. The issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or the appellant who was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. In the circumstances, the trial judge was not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under the Wildlife Act Regulations with use of a searchlight when hunting. The section of the Act that prohibits the use of searchlight in the context of hunting wildlife was amended to include the phrase 'hunting for wildlife' in the meaning of the words 'wildlife'. The defendant admitted to driving slowly in the dark and that he had seen a moose. The defendant acknowledged that he was driving slowly when he spotted the moose and that the mooses were located on the rear seat of the truck. The vehicle was under surveillance for approximately 30 minutes. The driver and owner of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, 30-round rifles, and 14 rounds of ammunition. The Defendant acknowledged that they had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck as they were traversing the forest. The searchlight was not used to search for wildlife. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting. It was not reasonable to believe that the driver was looking for a moosed when he was first observed. The evidence was that he drove slowly in a forest, and then returned to pick up his son and nephew after they had returned to the house. The Crown had closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and was not left in doubt by it. The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts filed as Exhibit P-1 and the production of five other exhibits. The Criminal Code speaks to the monetary penalty for contraventions of the act or Regulations. The offence was committed under the Act. The accused was convicted of possession of a weapon for the purpose of hunting and was fined $22,000. The seizure of the licence was made in connection with the seizure of his hunting licence. The conviction was not subject to forfeiture. The officer who pulled the defendant over was convicted on a charge of possession for the offence of trafficking. The offences were not related to hunting."
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.",The parties had both requested an order to seal their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media requested that the file be sealed to protect their reputation and to allow the Maintenance Enforcement Program to find a payor of spousal or child support. The parties had previously agreed that the filing of the divorce application would be a form of invasion of privacy. The court found that the public in general had an interest in and expected personal identifier information to remain private and confidential. The public interest in an open court was not completely circumscribed by the sealing order. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects particularly because the public interest is not completely inhibited by this order.

H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.

The Minister relies on the Public Charter and the Child and Family Services Act. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, this Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child and requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected (see: Child and Child Protection Act). The Public Charter does not permit the Public to act as a lawyer on behalf of a person who is of unsound mind in cases other than where a property interest is involved. If the court fails to intervene, the child will be left in limbo, a victim of the system. The Public is the appropriate person to act on behalf for the child.

3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.",The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's statement of claim struck out on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to disclose material facts relevant to its action. The plaintiff argued that it had not been able to prove that the city's negligence had been decided by a combination of the trial judge's and the Court of Appeal's decisions in the first action. It also argued that there was no final decision or judgment on any of the issues alleged by the plaintiff to be the subject of issue estoppel. The court dismissed the application. The Court held that the defendant had not shown that it intended to relitigate the action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept.
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,The appellant appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute between the two parties. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues. The appellant objected to payment of these amounts only because the respondent never consulted him in respect of incurring the expenses. She erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1) and the portion of the judgment relating to payments under s.7(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving. The accused was on duty, in uniform, and driving a marked police vehicle. The officer observed that the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of S. 27(5) of the Highway Traffic Act. The police conducted a traffic stop and observed the accused's vehicle approach a curb and then proceed to the police station. The vehicle struck the curb and bounced off the curb. The officers approached the driver, who produced photo driver identification in the name of the accused. The driver asked the officer why he had not stopped. The RCMP responded by arresting the accused and arresting him. The Crown argued that the officer was acting within his jurisdiction and was in the lawful execution of his duty. The court concluded that the police act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner to take away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. HELD: The accused's charges were dismissed. 1)The police act is to be read as providing for the purposes of funding police and a manner in which the Crown can take away the jurisdiction granted by the R. C.M.'s officers by The Royal Canadian RCMP Act. 2)The language used by the police was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. There is nothing in the scheme or object of The Royal Canada Mounted police Act that derogates from that basic presumption. The Court concluded that when there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act clearly outlines the duties of members who are peace officers. The Queen's Bench judge referred the court to several cases dealing with the jurisdiction of the RCMP. The wording used by parliament was clear and unambiguously clear. The language used was clear. There was nothing in that scheme or the police Act derogates. The only presumption that a police officer is acting in the proper execution of their duties is not to be attributed to a legislative body. The Act must be interpreted in the context of providing a 'way of funding' policing not 'a manner of taking away jurisdiction' granted to the officers by a Royal Canadian Crown Mounted. The words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian police officers are employed within the province. The"

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement.

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision.

A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant trustee licensed in bankruptcy pursuant to the BIA applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T.

The trustee argued that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to certain production employees (the ""Pension Plan Employees"") were too widely cast and inappropriate. The applicant proposed amendments to the Proposal that would have made the pension plan members a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the Proposal. The Trustee accepted the terms set out in the Pro proposal with respect the pension plans of past and past officers and directors. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the Proproposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and ss.50(13). The Trustees were in agreement with the second ground of Mr. Tilk's objection and they accede to an amendment of the proposal on this basis as clerical amendment. Taking into account all of these interests the Court concluded that the proposed amended proposal was reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors. It was also consistent with s. 50 of the Act."

The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the custody and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. The petitioner argued that the 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate. The appellant argued that there had not been a material change in circumstances and that the respondent should be allowed to vary his access. The court dismissed the appellant's application and directed trial on the issue of whether there should be variation of the custody order. The evidence on file showed that nothing had changed to warrant a variation. The material change threshold was not met. The applicant was awarded 10 months arrears of child support."

Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.",The accused was charged with breaking and entering and theft of property. The accused had previously entered guilty pleas to five counts contained in an indictment. The Crown had withdrawn action on the remaining counts. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of breaking and enter and theft. The Court also reduced the sentence to a further ten years. The court also reduced its sentence to four years imprisonment. The sentencing judge noted that the evidence was so extensive that a further reduction of one-half years would be justified. The evidence was that the defendant had a Grade X education and that he had sporadic employment over his adult years at his employment as a labourer. The sentence was based on the factors outlined in the pre-sentence report. The offender had a previous criminal record. The judge also noted that there was a low end of the range suggested by the Court of Appeal in Harris. The defendant plead guilty to three counts of break and enter.

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

The witness to the robbery testified that she had seen the accused leave the club and that he had asked her to come back. The defence argued that the letter was an attempt by the accused to deceive the witness into believing that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery. HELD: The accused was convicted of robbery. 1)Of course, the letter is not an 'alibi.' It is not fabricating. 2)The accused's admission that he wasn't at the Club at the night of the robberies was tantamount to an admission that the accused was not there at the moment of the robbing. 3)The letter was a fabrication. The evidence of the alleged robbery was not corroborated by the letter. 4)The evidence of a witness who testified that he saw the accused leaving the club after consuming a meal was not supported by the evidence of an alabis. 5)The defence argued the accused's letter was motivated by a desire to deceive and to induce perjured evidence. 6)The Court held that the evidence was not conclusive. The only conclusion drawn was that the defence had failed to establish that the alleged witness was the accused."

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against Westridge and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant was the general contractor and the general contractors issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge. The respondents take the position under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend. The plaintiff is also entitled to recover costs from the defendants. The defendant is also required to pay costs to the plaintiff. The defendants are also entitled, pursuant to the terms of the Westridge Tender, to correct any errors in the tender documents, to the specifications of the general contract, to any errors by the plaintiff in the specifications, to provide advice on the appropriate remedy, to make the necessary corrections, to ensure the plaintiff's safety and to provide expert advice to the general counsel. The Defendant is also liable for the costs of the plaintiff’s defence. The court reviewed the pleadings of the defendants and found that the defendant’ s position was that under the policy they were not obligated, and that the plaintiff was not obligated. The Court reviewed the defendant and its pleadings and found the defendant was not guilty of a breach of contract. The parties were found to have breached the terms and responsibilities of the defendant. The liability for the defendant is limited to the amount it is obligated to bear in the amount of the liability it is owed. The failure of the Defendant to provide adequate protection to the plaintiffs is a serious and life-threatening condition. The Plaintiff’S position was not supported by the pleadments. The claim was not covered by reason of an exclusion under the terms. The Defendants were found not guilty. The Onus of establishing that the terms, the terms in the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. The onus shifts to the insurer."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rules 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit she was struck from behind by the defendant. Defence counsel had gone to great extent to show the plaintiff's prior conditions would all combine to contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. The defendant argued there was an 'air of realty' to the plaintiff’s argument. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial. The Defendant argued there had yet to even be an independent medical examination of the plaintiff. 2)Costs were awarded to the parties. The court was satisfied there was no 'air to reality' to defendant’ s argument. 3)Judgment was entered against the respondent as to liability for the accident itself and not causation. The evidence submitted by the plaintiff submitted as attached to the affidavit of the defence counsel caused the court difficulty. 4)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his affidavit, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the plaintiff that could be overcome by a reasonable amount of money."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties were married for 22 years. They had four children. The oldest, who was now 23 years old, was assisting her with her studies. The mother was unable to negotiate with the father for a reduction in the current combination child and spousal support. The father was to pay $6,000 per month. The wife was to contribute $2,000 to the total child and child support. She was to receive $3,000 in monthly support. In 2005, the father ceased paying support. He made arrangements for monthly payments of $163.92 and $2.500 to the respondent. In 2006, the mother was forced into bankruptcy. The respondent was awarded $29,672.00. The court found that the respondent's monthly expenditures were not excessive."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. In the alternative, they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA. The defendants applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules for an order that ABank be added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The court found that the plaintiff had failed to prosecute this action without delay. The amendments sought would not create a wholly new proceeding.  2)The Court found that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The Court found the following: 1)Absent the existence of a third action, the Court found there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims. 2)Absence of a fourth action, which would result in a final decision against the defendant, and amending the Statement, would not be a wholly different proceeding."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds and one-third responsible for the injuries suffered by her husband. The defendant was found one-half responsible for her general damages at $50,000, including non-pecuniary loss of life, $25,000 and loss of future employment including loss of past and future income, in the amount of $25. Damage to the defendant's vehicle was determined at $1,255. The plaintiff submits that the award to the plaintiff, with interest for six years at 9.41 percent per annum and disbursements, less the Counterclaim, approximates the amount awarded. The Court concludes that the double recovery of costs created by the rate of interest is not followed in this case."
5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. The Crown had in the past brought an application to quash Count #2 on the basis that it was not bound by the findings of the Schafer judgment but rather by the Crown's decision to proceed with the trial of the co-accused. The applicant argued that the Crown had breached its agreement to provide particulars to the impugned count, which was similar to the one in the amended indictment but without enumerating particulars. The application was dismissed. HELD: The application to dismiss counts #1 and #2 was dismissed as not being relevant to the trial. The Court would consider an application for separation pursuant to ss. 590 if the accused could show that it would be prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the Court was not in any way bound by any of the findings in the Schaper indictment. The only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence was that the findings were not inconsistent with the Crown’s decision. The evidence was not conclusive that the accused had defrauded the Crown. The facts were not conclusive. The respondent’ s.581(2) was not used to determine the extent to which the Crown could proceed with a single transaction, but rather to establish that the evidence did not advance the Crown in light of the decision of Klebuc J. in the previous indictment."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a Saskatchewan highway to which the Minister's weight restriction applied. The accused was stopped by a police officer on patrol in the northwesterly direction and he was about to turn left onto a highway when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction approaching the junction of two highways. The officer stopped the vehicle and the accused was arrested. The Crown argued that the document referred to was proof of the Minister ordering the restriction and the order was a regulation under the provisions of the Interpretation Act. HELD: The accused's commission was established. 1)Even if the document was proof, the order is a regulation pursuant to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. 2)Even though the document is not proof of an order according to law, even if the documents are proof, even the copy of the order has established the commission of an offence under s38. The court found that the accused violated s38 of the Highway Traffic Act. The Court found that even if it could be said that the Minister had not taken appropriate steps to cause notice of the Order to be given, the Minister failed to take appropriate steps. Even if it was said that she had set out to set out the steps in the municipality, she could not have set out in any other way. Even though the municipality had taken sufficient steps to set up signs, the municipality could not be found to have set up any of the signs. The Minister failed in this regard. Even with the municipality's endorsement of the legislation, the court could not conclude that she set out a statutory requirement to set forth the statutory requirements. Even the document referenced above is proof of order. Even in the absence of an endorsement of legislation, it is not proven that the copy was printed by the Queen's Printer. The order is not a regulation. The municipality could be found in any of its subdivisions."
5_2002nsca108.txt,"The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter. Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The paternal grandmother was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The child did not participate in those proceedings. The Society had indicated to the appellant that she was willing to be considered as a placement for the child if the plan to return the child to her mother did not progress as anticipated. The applicant found that the Society had shut her out of the process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her before making the permanent care decision. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that a judge in Chambers did not have the authority to make the order sought. The evidence from the counsel and authorities was that a Chambers judge would not have jurisdiction to make an order. Even if he had jurisdiction to do so, the order would be an order as, in the opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent custody order appeared likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed. The Court dismissed the application. The Chambers judge had jurisdiction in the past to make orders. The Family Division not only has intimate knowledge of the permanent proceedings but is better equipped to deal with the evidentiary matters which are likely to arise in the course of the child's attempts to place her position before the Court. The Children's aid Society contests the jurisdiction of this Court or judge to make a order sought in Chambers. The children's aid society contests the jurisdictional jurisdiction of the Chambers judge to do the order seeking. The Child and Family Services Act does not provide a judge with jurisdiction to appoint an order for the purposes of appeal. The principles of the Children and Family Service Act do not confer jurisdiction. The only authority vested in the Chambers Judge is the judge of the Family Court."

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","The respondent bank agreed to foreclose its two registered mortgages against the subject land. The R.M. held that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage made by the R. M. even though the RM. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and the respondent, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the bank. The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent and the fee simple mortgage of Mainline. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the costs to respondent. 1)The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the R-M. The trial judge held that the respondent had priority over the R.-M. Mortgage. 2)The trial judge concluded that the feesimple mortgage of a respondent had a priority over that of Mainlin. 3)The appellant admits it was not intended, between itself, and Mainline that it will obtain a special interest in a priority to the bank of the corporation. The respondent admits that the mortgage was never conceived, as it was between itself. The applicant admits that its mortgage was not registered by the bank but by virtue of the Grant Agreement. 4)The Court held that registration, while arguably conclusive on the issues of notice and priority, does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of motor vehicle and driving while intoxicated. The Crown appealed the voir dire decision following a voir de dire on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused testified that after the roll-over, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. The officer detained the accused and detained him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time the accused was also awaiting treatment for his injuries and provided additional information to the officer. HELD: The accused's statements were not admissible. The evidence obtained was as a result of self-incriminating statements made to the arresting officer as a matter of fact. The police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The defence argued that if the accused's statement was made as a consequence of the arrest, it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer and that he had no right to make a demand. It was not clear to him that he was making these statements because he was afraid of being arrested. The Court held that the arrest was illegal and excluded all evidence obtained thereafter. The arrest was not illegal and the information obtained was illegally obtained. The information obtained by the information was illegally obtain and the police cannot rely on it to make that demand. There was nothing to prevent the accused from making these self- incriminating statements. The Police were instructed to look into the injuries and to contact the accused. The Accused's statements made after the arrest were self-initiative and self-confirming. The court concluded that the evidence received by the officer was as the result of breach of his section rights. The trial judge concluded that this was the case. The admission would render the trial unfair. The only conclusion that the officer made was that the accused believed he was reporting the accident and gave self-insulting statements to the officers as a reason for his belief. The fact that the police were instructed not to make these statements was irrelevant. The officers were instructed by the Crown to not make these self incriminating statement.

5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The parties appeared before the Small Claims Court adjudicator for hearing on the issue of whether the Small claims court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the Claimants. The Adjudicator found that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small's Court Act and the fact that the debt so created was simple contract debt and not specialty debt, and was subject to the appropriate limitation period. The applicant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The adjudicator erred in finding that the Small’s jurisdiction did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction. The appellant’ s interpretation of the Small Act was an error in law. The trial judge erred by finding that Eastside did not have jurisdiction to render the judgment. The issue was whether the Court had jurisdiction in Nova Scotia and Alberta. The court found the claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court. The fact that default judgment may be set aside at some time in the future, as argued by the Respondent, does not make it any less final or conclusive. Once judgment is rendered there is no proceeding that can be withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred as contemplated by the Act. The present claim extends into the authority and extent of the Alberta Small Claims court Act."

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","FIAT.

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.",The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s. 9(b)(c) Charter right. The officer noted that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow. The police had an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee was given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. The appeal court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief that the appellant's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence provided by the officer was sufficient to support the officer’s conclusion that the breath sample was positive. The respondent’ s. 8 Charter rights were breached. The Court dismissed the appellant’S appeal. It was not found that there was a breach in s. 11(b). The trial court found the trial court erred by failing to consider the factors articulated by the police as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer. The error was not the only reason the appellant appealed. The Appeal Court found that it was not a breach because the trial officer had not been trained in the field of sobriety and the officer did not have sufficient evidence to objectively support the appellant. The issue was whether the trial Judge erred on the facts of the case. The test for a Charter breach is whether the officer has had sufficient experience to make a determination that there is a reasonable and probable basis for the officer making a determination. The errors of fact are listed as follows: 1) The trial officer failed to consider that other car tracks in soft snow constituted evidence of impairment. The second issue is whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the officer could reasonably reach the verdict. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 2) The appellant”s appeal is dismissed. The failure of Cst. Schmidt to provide her with a warning resulted. The judge did nothing wrong. The facts as found by the appellant were not the basis upon which he formed his decision that the driver was impaired

Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.",HELD: The Court accepted the respondent’s submission that the plaintiff had entered into a contract with the respondent. The Court held that the contract was valid and that the respondent had not made any errors in the contract. The court also held that there was no evidence that the agreement was created between the respondent and the respondent in any event. The respondent”s submission was not supported by the evidence. The evidence was that the parties had exchanged information during the bidding process and that they had not discussed the terms of the contract in any way. The plaintiff was also awarded specific performance and damages. The issue was whether the agreement existed between the parties and whether the respondent was entitled to receive the appropriate deposit respecting the purchase of the respondent property. The petitioner was awarded general damages.

That may or may not be the case but for the purposes of securing full disclosure in this proceeding which is the one with which we are concerned, it is insufficient reason to limit full disclosure.

He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.",The plaintiff and her tenant escaped a three-storey apartment building fire by jumping from the top floor. The plaintiff's apartment was located on the third floor. It was a wooden structure with vinyl siding on the exterior and asphalt roof. The ceiling was blackened and the attic was covered in smoke. The fire alarm system was not working at the time of the fire. The tenant's son was asleep in the living room when the fire broke out. The smoke detector in the building was not functioning at the moment of the blaze. The tenants were unable to escape the building due to the smoke detector malfunctioning. The battery operated smoke alarm in the plaintiff's building did not function at the scene of the incident. The defendant's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any leasehold lease with the plaintiff and preventing the defendant, the plaintiff from permitting the operation of a bingo hall in the Jubilee Building. The defendant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining it from permitting a bingo hall in its premises except as a subtenant. The plaintiff had entered into written agreements with the defendant for the day to day operation of the bingo halls, including a further sub-lease by the defendant to RCBA for the same space. The parties met once to discuss the relocation of the venue but there was no sign that the parties had discussed the future of the facility. The applicant entered into a written agreement with the respondent for the purpose of the day-to-day operation of bingo facilities but there had never been any indication that the applicant wanted to renew the lease. The respondent failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff's inconvenience was greater than that of the defendant if it was declined. The court dismissed the application for an inter-locutory injunctive injunction. The sublease contains a provision whereby GCB could have compelled the plaintiff to renew a lease but there is no indication it acted in any way to exercise that right. On the balance of convenience and convenience the plaintiff would suffer if the injunction was granted, the defendant's interests must receive the same consideration as the plaintiff’s."
7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","HELD: The application was allowed. The court found that the respondent was not in possession of the two trailers but that it had constructive possession of them. The issue was what was meant by the term 'possession' in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in the circumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of these trailers within the meaning of s. 33(2). The court ordered that the security interests in the trailers had priority to Humboldt's security interests. The respondent did not have possession prior to December 22, 1997. The applicant could not rely on s.34(2) for priority because its purchase money security interests were not perfected within fifteen days of that date as required by the section. The Court found that Lake Air had actual or constructive possession prior thereto."

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000. She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000. HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled.

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada regarding alleged abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The parties have been unemployed for the most part. Arrears of child support are constantly accruing. The father is restrained from disposing of any money he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without an order from the Court. HELD: 1) The respondent's counsel is required to report to the Court forthwith as to the potential for damage to the respondent's property. 2) The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. 3) In the event the respondent receives damages from the Government he may well be his only significant asset and, more to the point, the only asset that can be used to meet the respondent’s outstanding and ever accruating child support obligations. 4) In Anderson, the section relied upon by the petitioner is s.7 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.F6.2 (the “Act”). Section 8(1) of the Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom claim under a certain Act may be made and therefore made no order vis-a-vis the respondent. The petitioner bases her application on the ground that if the respondent received damages from Canada that may well well be the only significant object that can reasonably become source of satisfying claim under this Act. The only asset to meet his outstanding and always accruation child support obligation is the one asset that could reasonably become a source of source of income for the respondent and society as a whole.

The husband was in the military; the wife was a cleaner on a military base when the parties met and she changed jobs at the husband's direction. She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The parties were married for more than one year and had no children. The respondent was receiving $1,600 monthly spousal support. The court found that the respondent was entitled to spousa for the duration of the marriage. The parties had lived separate and apart for more more than a year and there was no possibility of reconciliation. The petitioner was entitled $1.5 million in spousas for the period of cohabitation. The Court held that the petitioner was responsible for the payment of matrimonial debts. The issue was whether the usual equal division dictated by the Matrimonial Property Act would be unfair or unconscionable. The evidence did not support the claim that the parties were in a relationship. The husband was receiving spouso for the term of the agreement. The wife was receiving a spousarium for the purposes of the cohabitations. The amount of spousousa was reduced to $1 per month. The judge found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the agreement was in any way binding. The agreement was not made to allow the judge to pick the outcome that he preferred from among various alternative dispositions."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT. The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The respondent's claim is totally separate from the claim. The landowner has no title save to the extent that he initiated complaints about the livestock operations and the damages it was causing to his land. The proposed subdivision is in contravention of the Act, the regulations and the Zoning bylaw. 2) The applicant, the School Division, is asking the court to order subdivision of Parcel G as precondition to the vesting of the order. The application in question is tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 3) The original transaction between the School and the Flads was concluded in 1996, conditional on subdivision approval, which the Court was to continue until further order of the Court.

An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter.

The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.

The College of Medicine insists that the applicant must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his residency program. The applicant has not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University and there is no evidence that the College of Management has any say in the matter. HELD: The applicant's status was changed to suspension with pay pending the completion of the Investigative Committee reviews. The University insisted that the appellant must find another sponsor prior before being allowed back to his program. 1) The applicant had not yet concluded his appeals. The college insisted that he must find his third party sponsors prior to be allowed to return to his residency. 2) The College was in no position to waive the provisions of the collective agreement because it cannot unilaterally change the terms of the agreement. The fact that the respondent was such a student and for reasons which will be outlined hereafter, his third parties funding was depleted during the period he was suspended. The appeal committee recommended that the appeal committee recommend that the student be allowed back on probation. The university insisted that this decision was properly decided. 3) The respondent was not in any position to be a party to the appeal process. The respondent's third party funding was not depleted during his suspension. The Court of Queen's Bench determined that the petitioner should not have been dismissed prior to an investigation into the matters that led to him being placed on probation to begin with. The court found that the Crown had jurisdiction to determine disputes which were governed by the internal law, policies, and procedures of the university. The petitioner was entitled to seek the assistance of a judge of the Court of the Queen's Court.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The Crown and the youth were asked to give viva voce evidence in support of their application. The Crown sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. The crown, the young person and the parent argued that the conference should not be open to the public and the media. The court took the position that this was a public proceeding to which they should have access. The Court found that the public's interest was at the forefront of the discussions and that the only thing that would compromise the public’s understanding of the justice system was the adequacy of government programs and support for the young offender. The public was also encouraged to participate in the discussions. The exclusion order was upheld. The appeal court found that it had discretion to exclude the public from the conference. The evidence before the court rebutted the open court principle and supported an order pursuant to s. 132 of the Act. The judge found that this case was a “public proceeding to be of interest to the court.” The court found the following: 1) the public was entitled to participate; 2) the court found there was a danger to the general public and that it would be in the public interest to exclude them; 3) the Court found the public had a right to participate and that public participation was not to be discouraged. The general rule of openness was not absolute. The courts were required to consider the interests of society in the protection and rehabilitation of young people involved in youth court proceedings. The only way to do so was to allow the public to participate. The issue was whether the media should be excluded from the presentencing event. The media were not to interfere with the proceedings."

The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s.253(a) and driving while over.08 contrary to S.253. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of s.(1) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulations Act. The Court also held that because this was not a random vehicle stop, the accused's right to retain and instruct counsel was violated. The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand was not made 'forth with' and the accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both readings being 120 mgs. The accused was detained for 17 minutes while the police waited for roadside machine and he complied. The court also held the accused had a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. The trial judge accepted the trial judge's decision and the Court held the Court's reasoning was correct. The issue was whether the delay in taking the test and in advising the accused of his rights to counsel violated the Charter. The evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded under s24(2). The Court concluded that the Court had not made an error in the Charter and therefore there was no breach of the Charter by the Court. The error was not in the Court’s mind."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was found in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to remove all of his equipment from his property. The respondent had taken no significant steps to comply and was now in contempt. The court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor/client costs. The defendant was to appear in court on February 2, 2014. The Court ordered the defendant to pay court costs. It also ordered the plaintiff to dispose of any equipment that remained on his property beyond the time stipulated in the order. The plaintiff was to pay costs to the defendant. The costs of the contempt application were to be assessed at $15,000. The applicant had made significant progress in complying with the order and was prepared to continue to remove the offending equipment. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent had not shown reasonable concern for his safety and that the court had not fettered its discretion in awarding costs."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to either witness. The Crown's expert testified that the barrel of the handgun was not the original factory barrel and other indicia from the evidence at the scene did not support the appellant's version of events. The defence argued that Vetrove warning was mandatory, regardless of the position taken by the defendant at the time of trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrochio warning in relation the testimony of either witness, regardless if the defendant's position was taken at the trial. The Court found that this was an error of law. 2) The Court held that the evidence was not so circumstantial as to suggest that the appellant had made an error in law. The evidence was so strong that it could not be excluded. The court found the appellant was guilty of both counts. The appellant's evidence was unreliable and the Court found the trial court did not err in failing to give a warning. The appeal court found there was no evidence that the jury was misled. The jury was left to decide whether the appellant should give a verbal warning. 3) The court dismissed the appellant’s appeal. The decision was based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and the importance of the witness’ evidence to the Crown. The test of credibility was not a factor on its own. The judge was not required to give the appellant a warning in the circumstances. The issue was whether the trial officer should have given a warning to either witnesses. The error was not made lightly. The verdict could only have been salvaged under the curative provision set forth in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code if he concluded that the appeal court concluded that he had erred in law by failing to provide a warning when the circumstances required one to be given. The Appeal Court found there were other considerations that inform the decision. The only issue that the Court raised was whether it was an appropriate level of concern and caution."

The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction.

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent union appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board, which had overturned three of the individual respondents' convictions. The union alleged that the respondent had committed an unfair labour practice. Dismissing the applications, that the Board's decision was not patently unreasonable. The respondents were hotel employees who had been dismissed from their employment because they were members of a trade union and participated in the activities of trade union. The respondent union had also brought an action for judicial review. The court found that the board's decision to reinstate the individual employees was not unreasonable."

The accused's mother tongue was French and the trial judge did not advise him of his rights to trial. The trial judge had no discretion and was obligated only to the unrepresented appellant the right to be tried in either language. The only ground of the appeal was the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his Rights to trial by French or English pursuant to S. 530. The appellant's mother was French. The failure by the Provincial court Judge to advise him in English constitutes a procedural wrong. The Court would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

The Court found that the only evidence that suggested the mother was not mentally competent was that of the Plaintiff's 21 year old daughter. The Plaintiff had sold two properties and had a joint bank account. The Power of attorney was used solely for the Plaintiff and the joint bank accounts. The court found that there was no evidence that the Plaintiff was mentally competent at the time of her death.

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) Does it have jurisdiction in the circumstances where an appeal from a wage assessor to the Director's Branch (the Director) and an appeal to the Court's adjudicator (the adjudicator) both require appeals within 21 days? 3) The applicant has not met the criteria necessary to set up a hearing on the merits. The consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 4) The Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a dangerous person and that long-term offender designation was appropriate. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code.
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.",HELD: The Court found that the accused were guilty of breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm. The Court also found that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of any other offences. The accused did not file a victim impact statement with the Court and he was not overly co-operative with the Crown once he was out of custody. The Crown relied on the information contained in the pre-sentence report as well as the submissions made by the witnesses. The court found that all three accused had a significant criminal record. The offences occurred within a short period of time. The defendant had not been involved in any of the offences.

Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.",HELD: The court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Child and Family Services Act.

The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.",The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) at Kelvingtons is a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The respondents also requested an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of the Act. KSS applied for intervenor status. The chambers judge granted the application without costs. The court found that the proposal was not a development as defined in s.2(d). The respondents deposed that the operation would turn over hogs three times a year and produce up to 14.7 million gallons of liquid manure per year. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)The court found the proposal not a developing as defined by s2(D) of the Environmental Assessment act. 2)The respondent's affidavits were not sufficient to establish that the project was a development. 3)The respondents' affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents and the intervenor revealed no disagreement on the essential underlying facts. 4)The applicant's affidavit were not confined to facts as the respondent was not able to prove on their own that the applicant's affidavit evidence was based primarily on information and belief. 5)The Court found that KSS was not developing as a development under the Environmental assessment Act.  6)The petitioner's affidavitts were not examined in their entirety and the court did not rule on the admissibility of the evidence. 7)The affidavit evidence did not establish that K SS was developing as per s2.d of the Assessment Act and therefore the Court was not entitled to grant intervenor rights. 8)The affidavits did not prove that the application was a proper development as the applicant had not obtained the required permits. 9)The environmental assessment was conducted under existing regulations and controls and no secondary developments were required. The petitioner's affidavit was not sufficient for the Court to determine whether the applicant has standing to privately enforce a public right. The Court found the petitioner had not shown that the petitioner's sworn affidavit evidence indicated that the respondent's affidavit material was not inadmissible. The respondent's sworn affidavits do not establish a public interest in the petitioner. 10)The issue was whether the petitioner has standing. The issue was the adequacy of the affidavit evidence. The affidavit evidence is sufficient to show that the petition was made after it had conducted a review of the environmental

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.",The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of the respondent's family physician. The respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with the Addiction Prevention and Treatment Services. The Minister requested the documents to be produced. The applicant argued that this was a low threshold for a protection proceeding under the Children and Family Services Act. The court found that the Minister had an obligation to investigate any and all information regarding child protection concerns. The Court found that this obligation was met because the respondent had not participated in previous child protection proceedings. The order for production was not necessary to ensure the proper disposition of the proceeding. The documents produced were not necessary for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the order. The application of Rule 69 was dismissed. The Rule 69 rule does not assist in the interpretation of Rule 74. The degree of protection given by the Rule 69 may be absolute or partial depending on what is required to strike the proper balance between the interest in protecting the communication from disclosure and the interest of the Minister to develop and evaluate an appropriate plan of care. The records are not relevant to the proceeding and the court has no authority to prevent disclosure of that information.

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources sought orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 but in view of the respondent's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial. The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial although he and the respondent were cohabiting. The appellant did attend the trial and the notice of the application. The petitioner did not appear at the pre trial or the proceeding. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the respondent had not shown any signs of mental or emotional distress. The evidence was that the child had been in the presence of his parents for several days and that he had been exposed to a lot of drugs and alcohol. The Court found that there was no evidence that the appellant had been involved in any violence. The child was placed in the care of the Department for three months. The Department of Child andFamily Services sought an order placing the appellant with the respondent until age 16 pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. The parties agreed that the Court would consider the best interests of the child and that the best interest of the children was to have them remain in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18. The applicant did not oppose the applications in respect of the appellant and the petitioner but sought the return of the petitioner. The children were placed with the appellant until age 17 pursuant to the Child and Child Services Act. HELD: The Court held that the application was not supported by the evidence. The application was dismissed. The matter was set to be reviewed and the trial date was fixed. The mother was to give 60 days notice of her appointment. The father was to provide counsel to the court. The judge ordered that the children remain in their care until the time of their 18th birthday. The order was made to ensure that the court would consider all the factors that the applicant had to say in the application and that it would be appropriate to include in the order the respondent was to be supervised. The Children were placed in their custody until the expiry of period of 1 year. The trial judge ordered the return the respondent to her care. The issue was whether the Court should consider the appellant's best interests in the best circumstances. The issues were whether the respondent should be placed in a foster home or in a Departmental foster home. The imputed costs of the court's application were $1,000. The costs of providing the respondent a reasonable accommodation."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","HELD: Appeal dismissed. The cross-appeal was dismissed. Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code are not inconsistent with the standard procedure. The Protocol is not inconsistent. 2) The Protocol provides for the payment of physician services by way of a particular billing code. The principles are not consistent with the Standard Procedure. 3) The standard procedure is not the same as the one used in the trial. The standard tests are standard tests and not unusual. 4) The AU code is not applicable to the accounts submitted by a physician. The only exception is the ECG and Holter monitor procedures which are at the root of this appeal are standard test. The ECG is not an amendment of the Payment Schedule by way that the Protocol does not apply. 5) The protocols are not the central feature of the payment regime. The real world effect of applying the AU Code to some 12,000 accounts was to refuse compensation. The trial judge began his decision by rejecting the Government’s argument that the payment schedule was designed to facilitate the payment and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. The appeal and cross-examination were necessary to properly assess its merit. The court found that both the appeal/cross-appaleal and the application of the appeal were not inconsistent and the principles of a standard procedure were not in any way inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. The protocols were designed to provide an individualized administrative process. The provisions set out in the Protocol were not consistent. The protocol was designed in an individual way to facilitate payment of the physician’ s. 3(d) and 6(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations. The Court found that the standard tests, standard tests which are not 'unusual' in and of themselves, caused that result. The aspects of the protocol relating to the AU codes operationalize that right in the circumstances of the patient’S unusual practice. The Act provides for a wide range of services. The physician”s ability to pay for these services is limited by the nature of the service provided. The medical doctor’d be entitled to receive compensation for services provided by him. The payment schedule is designed to be an individualization process. However, the principles in the protocol are not fundamentally different. The principle of the standard protocol is best characterized by the fact that the physician was not paid. The"
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a 16 year old, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the accused was not attending school because he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. The accused appealed his sentence and applied for release pending appeal. Application for release on appeal dismissed. The Court found that the accused had not satisfied the onus on the appellant under s. 679(4)(a) of s. Criminal Code to be much more stringent than for an appeal against conviction. The court found that given the circumstances of the offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders, the appellant's release would be in the public interest. The onus was on the respondent under s679(5)(a), s. 109(1), s(2) of S. 678 to establish whether an appeal is sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The appellant had not met the on-us requirement that he be released pending appeal, given the serious nature of the offences here, the principles of the Y.C.J.A. and the reasons for sentence given by Judge Campbell, the general reluctance of this Court to interfere with youth sentences unless it is clearly excessive or based on wrong principles.

HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with committing sexual assaults on two young girls. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victims' skin and touched their genitals, and that there was digital penetration. The accused admitted to touching the victims under their clothes. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that digital penetration occurred. The Court concluded that the sexual assaults were frequent occurrences and that the offences were repeated.

The trial court gave no articulable reason to prefer the confused and contradictory evidence of the independent witness to that of the appellant. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he did not know had happened prior to returning from the store.  3) The respondent submits that the reasons of the trial judge are sufficient, pointing to her assessment of credibility of the credibility of that of that individual to that that of her. 4) The court gave sufficient reason to award the evidence of 'the independent witness' over the clear evidence of appellant."

Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The union applied to have the arbitrator's award set aside. The union argued that the arbitrators had not acted in good faith and that the grievance was not in the category of irreparable harm. The employer had not provided sufficient detail to the union as to the extent that it had conducted promotional routines for the positions of lieutenants. The Union alleged that the employer had violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the employer conducted promotional routine for the position of lieutenant. The grievance was brought forward through arbitration pursuant to collective agreement between the parties. The unions alleged that this was an attempt to use inexperienced personnel. The arbitrator awarded the contract to the lieutenant who had elected to return to the rank of fire fighter and continue as such. The lieutenancy award was set aside and the union appealed. The appeal court held that the union's position was that only the suitability aspect of the testing procedure was being challenged. The court held the following: 1) the arbitration award was not set aside; 2) the union was awarded the award for 'gross loss of revenue' and the arbiter's award was for 'loss of profits'. The union's argument that the award was unreasonable and unjustified was dismissed. The Court held that as difficult as it is for these individuals who have done nothing wrong, that it is not in any category of 'parable harm'. The movement that might have been brought about if those who were demoted could not act as acting lieutenans and were required to return from the platoons in which they were, prior to being promoted, has not materialized and is not likely to materialize in any real measure until after this matter has been heard.

The court applied an objective test and concluded a reasonable apprehension of bias existed. Supplementary reasons should not be written without a request from the Court of Appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction on three counts of unlawful assault. The appellant argued that the trial judge based his decision on considerations which were not supported in the evidence. The trial judge did not admit the statement at trial and the appellant argued the trial Judge erred in not admitting it at trial. The appeal court held that the appellant's reasons for the assault were not valid and that the judge had erred by not admitting the statement. The Appeal Court held that this was not the trial court's decision and that it was not appropriate to issue supplementary reasons. The Crown argued that it had not received any material from the trial judges prior to the release of the Supplementary Reasons.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal has an obligation to defend. On November 19, 1993, McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, his wife's Honda was deflated. At issue was whether Royal was obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The chambers judge found that the policy did not provide coverage for that which was alleged in the pleadings. The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. 2)The respondent was under no obligation to protect McLeod in the pending action."

HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution. 1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code. There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The accused suffered bruising and soreness from the incident. HELD: A non-custodial sentence was justified. The Court found that a sentence in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. Taking all of the factors of sentencing into account, it was the sentence of the Court that it was sentenced to serve a term of 18 months in a Provincial correctional centre. Taking the factors into account it was a sentence that was served in a province correctional centre, as the accused was a model citizen until the offence and had voluntarily quit using alcohol. The sentence must be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. The court found that the sentence must not be in the range of three years. The victim was harassed and had her property damaged and was forced to go for counselling. The offence had grave consequences for the victim because some people appeared to treat her as the offender rather than the victim. The defence claimed the Crown failed to prove this assertion. The evidence showed the victim had lost her job, lost her position in the community and was ostracized in the town. The damage and vandalism had no connection to the offence. The only thing that could have been avoided was a lengthy sentence. The sentences imposed were to be served in provincial correctional facilities."

To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge returned the plaintiff's notice of motion and granted an order directing the defendants to respond to undertakings given in the examination for discovery of Krake. HELD: The order was granted. There was no basis for a pre-trial conference until the action was ready for trial.

The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The petitioner was employed outside of the home throughout the marriage. The respondent lived in the matrimonial home. The parties were married for 22 years. During the first two months of the separation the children spent alternate weeks with each parent. During this time the petitioner was involved in the day-to-day care of the children. During their separation the respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. The child was placed in the primary residence of the petitioner. The father was given reasonable telephone access with the children and access at other times as the parties may agree. The mother was prepared in the initial stages to be more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact. The court was satisfied that the petitioner's access was adequate and that the father was to have reasonable telephone contact with the child. The issue was whether the respondent was insistent upon things being done his way. The primary issue is whether the petitioner has the best interests of the child in mind. HELD: The parties agreed that the respondent should have more flexibility and that he was to provide the primary home. 1)The respondent was to pay the petitioner 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the employment arrangement. 2)The parties were to have joint custody of the two young children. They were to provide primary residence. The Court was satisfied the petitioner had demonstrated sensitivity at times, on the part of both parents, to the needs of their children and the interests of each other.

b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.",The accused was committed to stand trial on one count of fraud. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused had been denied a reasonable opportunity to be heard in a timely manner. 2) The length of delay in proceeding with the preliminary hearing was 8 months. 3) The Crown failed to make sufficient disclosure to the accused. 4) The court found that there was no evidence that the Crown had been negligent in failing to provide timely disclosure. 5) The accused's evidence was not accepted. 6) The evidence was examined. 7) The prejudice to the defendant has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. The Court was not satisfied that the inherent time requirements of the case require 22-month delay from charge to trial. 8) The fact that the defence failed to provide sufficient disclosure was not a sufficient reason to grant an application for a stay. 9) The trial judge was not able to determine whether the accused was prejudiced by the delay. The court was not convinced that the evidence was so compelling that it would be unreasonable to grant a stay of proceedings. The accused was not entitled to compensation for the delay and the Court was unable to determine if the Crown was negligent in making timely disclosure or not. The trial court was also not satisfied the inherent and temporal time requirements required by s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of rights and Freedom. The Crown was not responsible for the prejudice. 10) The amount of time between the preliminary and preliminary hearings was reduced to 2 weeks. The amount that the Court could reasonably expect to be paid to the defence was reduced by 2 weeks to allow the defence to make more detailed disclosure. The length was not unreasonable. The evidence did not support the inference that the delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide proper disclosure. 11) The costs of the delay were not unreasonable and the prejudice was sufficient to tip the balance of the balance.
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. The plaintiffs' actions did not settle. The defendants' prospects were not encouraging. The farmers' prospects had not encouraging, and serious concerns about how long the action would take and the outcome of the litigation. The respondent's officer, Hamm, paid a deposit to the defendant for remittance to the plaintiff's account. The court was awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff and the Companies' actions against the defendant, with interest. The applicant was awarded $10,000 in general and $20,000 interest. HELD: The court struck the respondent's affidavit as evidence of the respondent’s commitment to protect the plaintiff’ s account. It was not evidence of his willingness to accept personal responsibility. The portions of the affidavit were not evidence but hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt. The Court was also awarded $5,000.00 in interest."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse. The Court held that the evidence of the complainant was unreliable and that the trial judge failed to charge the jury with the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was acquitted on a balance of probabilities. The court reviewed the various cases and found that the defence was not saved by s. 1 of the Code. HELD: The accused's conviction was upheld on a trial on the basis that the Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The defence of extreme drunkenness was successful in almost every case of intoxication that arose from drinking alcohol as beverage or abusing drugs. The only defence raised by the accused was that he honestly believed he had the consent of the person to have sexual intercourse; the Court held the accused's belief arose from self- induced intoxication and was not a reasonable inference. The evidence of his 11-year old son was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence. The conclusion that the self-inflicted intoxication of the accused and the complainant is caused by the automatic state arises from self induced intoxication is not a defence to an assault type of charge. The fact that the complainant’ s. 33.1 defence is not saved because it is not supported by the evidence."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of jurisdiance over the accused and not the offence. The special plea was based solely on the found that the Alberta Provincial Court had lost its jurisdiction over the respondent. The Crown appealed. 2)The Court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over him. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. 3)The court was unable, in the opinion of the Court, to agree the appearance by respondent in Saskatchewan court on May 7/2001 revived jurisdiction. The Court was also unable to conclude that the special plea had been applicable in this case. 4)The Crown was correct in concluding that the Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction over it. 5)The accused was not subject to the possibility of administrative penalties in both provinces. 6)The evidence before the Court was not conclusive that the trial court erred by finding that a special pleading of autRefois acquito was applicable in the case. The court was correct to conclude the Alberta provincial court had regained jurisdiction over this person. 7)The issue before the court was whether jurisdiction was lost in Alberta or Saskatchewan. 8)The only remedy left is an appeal. The accused was to appear in Alberta. 9)The issues before the Appeal Court were whether jurisdiction of the court lost in Saskatchewan? 10)If jurisdiction was not lost in the province, did it give rise to a plea of autorefois? 11)The appeal court was not satisfied that the Crown had lost the jurisdiction to proceed with the charges in Alberta and therefore the appeal court should be dismissed for abuse of the process."

The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in 1998. In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendants embarked upon the project but after time ceased the work. The plaintiffs counterclaim alleged negligence by the defendant. The respondent argued that the plaintiff failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The judge granted the application for security for the costs in a lesser amount of money. The court found that the respondent had a duty to post security for cost in the event of a counterclaim. The counterclaim was dismissed and the court ordered security for $18,000 to be posted. The Court found that there was no absolute prohibition on the granting of security for a cost. The issue was whether the respondent was liable for any award of costs. The question was whether it was. The answer was that the question was: 'Is there a duty of protection?' The court concluded that the answer was yes. The evidence was that there had been a breach of trust and the respondent should be held liable for the award of any award. The fact that the counterclaim had already been filed in Alberta did not preclude the granting an order for security. The only issue that the court could not decide was whether to issue a security for an costs order. The order was made in the absence of any evidence that the claim was not wholly distinct from the claim. The applicant was entitled to security for any costs."
b_2006skca54.txt,"The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","The respondent was found to have breached the clause prohibiting him from soliciting customers of the appellant. Belterra appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1) Even if his conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him to soliciting the customers of an appellant, Belterran failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. 2) Even though his conduct was a breach, even if his breach of his contract, BelTerra failed to show any loss. 3) In light of the view we take of the matter, it is not necessary for us to decide whether Mr Yaganiski's conduct amounted to a breach if on balance we incline to the opinion it did. Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belterrail has not satisfied us that it suffered any loss due to the breaches."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge found that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to the trial judge's finding that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand, the officer was not obliged to wait 15 minutes on the grounds that the driver had just left a bar. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The court found that the trial court erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can at the scene. The Court found that under s. 24(2) of the charter the certificate of analysis should be excluded from evidence. The appeal court found the trial officer was entitled to rely on the results of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable and possible grounds to arrest the appellant when he knew there was a possibility that the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the administration of the test and that if she had, the result of the Test could be inaccurate. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed. The issue of whether the officer should rely on a breathalyze demand was raised. The evidence was not found to be that the appellant had not shown any reasonable and reasonable grounds to rely upon the accuracy. The certificate of Analysis was not tendered as evidence at trial. The Crown appealed. The Appeal Court found the appellant was entitled, but not required, to rely solely on the ASD results. The error was not made in the manner the trial Judge concluded. The test was administered within 15 minutes of the appellant's vehicle leaving the bar."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises at suite B. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenant appeals. The hearing officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties.

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The chambers judge found that the appellant failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce a testamentary gift after his death had bound a person to be the sole beneficiary under the will. The mother of the deceased appeals. Appeal dismissed. The Chambers judge relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra for the purposes of the corollary relief judgment. The chambers judge held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the appellant's entitlement to the gift. The respondent's mother appealed. The court found that in the circumstances, the appellant had not produced any legal evidence that a verbal promise to not renounce or refuse a testamentarian gift after the death of her former spouse had resulted in the appellant renouncing any claim against the estate of her late husband and any right to share in the estate with the respondent. The appellant failed in this respect to the extent to which a contractual pledge to renounced a testamentative gift after death had been made by the appellant. The Court found that there was no evidence that the respondent had contractually bound herself to renouncing the gift after her death. The evidence did not support the appellant’s position that the gift to the respondent was a contractual obligation and therefore not binding."
b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant was found guilty of several drug offences. The police entered his home and searched the premises. They found a large quantity of drugs and a large amount of alcohol. They also entered a bedroom where the appellant was lying on the bed. The appellant cooperated during the search. The complainant called the police and said that she was fine. The officers entered the home and found the appellant lying on his bed. They searched the house and found a quantity of marijuana. The respondent called the RCMP and asked them to search the premises for the presence of other persons. The RCMP entered the house. The caller called the Police and said she was in trouble. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside. The trial judge failed to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home, and the search of the premises without a warrant. The evidence found by the police was not material to the Court's s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure. The Court held that the Crown had proved that the police acted reasonably and lawfully in searching the appellant's home and that there was no violation of s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court held that in the circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence. In those circumstances, police had to enter whether invited or not. The perceived scream meant that either the complainant was lying about being okay or that someone else inside was in danger. The search of premises was justified. The accused was convicted of trafficking.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.

The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.

The decision of the hearing officers is set aside and the matter is remitted to the hearing office for a re-examination. The reasons for the appeal are inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter must be remitted. The simple fact tenant's application is not formally before a hearing hearing officer at the same time as landlord's does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord's dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order. The tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. The tenant's claim for non-payment of rent has been established and in fashioning an appropriate remedy the hearing hearing hearing the tenant failed to take into account the alleged bed bug infestation, associated problems and expenses incurred. The Court found the reasons inadequate to permit for meaningful analysis of the appeal and for that reason the issue must be returned to the Hearing officer for rehearing on a new hearing."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.

The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant but the tenant has given Notice of Intention to Renew the Lease to the landlord. Although the evidence shows that water in the basement caused a mildew and moisture in the interior, the evidence does show that a part, but only a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor.

The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.

b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.",The accused was charged with unlawfully fishing for or catch and retain fish in waters of the Canoe Lake Band. The evidence was that the accused was a Treaty Indian and that the fishing was conducted in a manner consistent with the terms of the Treaty. The Court found that the evidence was so extensive that it could not be relied on to infringe upon the Treaty right to fish for food twenty-three years later. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so wished. The court found that there was no evidence that the Treaty rights were infringed upon in any event.
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. The Court also held that the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence was that it was property obtained by the commission of an indictable offence in Canada. The Crown challenged the evidence of the accused. The court held that a handshake agreement was made with the parties that the parties would work together to grow marijuana plants. The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purposes of trafficking. Based on the totality of the evidence, the only conclusion to being drawn in regard of the money found in the residence is that it is property obtained from the commission."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. The Crown had changed its counsel and requested a dedicated Gladue Report. The court reviewed the cases provided to it by counsel and the Crown and agreed that a 15 year global sentence was appropriate. The Court reviewed the three cases provided by counsel but the Crown had not provided any evidence as to Gladue factors. The evidence was clear that the Crown did not intend to rely specifically on the Gladue factor. The trial judge had indicated that he did not have the up-to-date record of the accused and that he was not aboriginal. The sentencing judge had also indicated that the accused had a history of violent offending and that the evidence did not show that he had a significant remorse. The sentence for the manslaughter was increased to that of 10. The judge noted that the Gladues factors were not considered in the sentencing decision. The sentences for the offence were reduced to that for the first time in the history of the offence. The accused was given credit for 3 years, 7 months and 1.5 years on remand for the time he spent on remands since being arrested. The amount of time he had spent on a remand was reduced to 1.25 to 1 year. The length of time that he would have been out of the country was reduced by the amount of remand. The average sentence for a manslaughter conviction is between 4 years and 5 months. The maximum sentence for manslaughter is 10 years. The offence is unique in that it covers a broad spectrum of circumstances. There are numerous Gladue Factors relevant to the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. The defendant was found not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of second degree murder. The factors relevant to him were the combination of Gladue and manslaughter factors."

The defendant had then proceeded to waive the conditional sale clause and the plaintiff had to pay $20,000 for the mortgage. The court found that the defendants had been totally irresponsible in allowing the plaintiff's claim for mental anguish to proceed.

The evidence showed that the husband had a reasonable expectation of receiving an interest in the property and that the defendant knew or ought to have known of this expectation. The Court found that Mrs. Keddy had met these requirements. The only issue was whether the wife was entitled to an interest.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.",The Chambers judge found no material error in the appellant's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the collective agreement.

The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.

The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent.

HELD: The variation application was dismissed with costs to the respondent as the respondent's modest means did not provide any proper ground for variation of the agreement. The fact that the respondent was now 67 years old and retired and had deposed to substantial business investment losses in the United States demonstrated that the retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The retirement of applicant and his income was reasonably reasonably foreseeable even after taking into account the amount she was receiving as spousa. The mother's modest level of income provided any proper grounds for variation. The father's modest retirement income was clearly indicated by the agreement that there shall be a complete, final and effective settlement of their respective rights. The wife's modest lifestyle demonstrated that there was a reasonably foreseeable change in circumstances. The husband's retirement was reasonably likely and the reduced income as consequence was foreseeable even though taking into consideration the amount he was receiving in spousas. The Mother's modest incomes provided any appropriate ground for a variation application. The Father's modest wage was reasonably well established.

The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.

Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant corporation was convicted of an offence under s. 813 of the Tobacco Act. The defendant corporation had been charged with an unlawful supply of tobacco products to a young person contrary to s. 7(1) of the Act. HELD: The conviction was quashed, the sentence vacated and an acquittal entered. The trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for defence. The evidence showed that prior to the incident, the defendant had an established system to prevent the commission of the offence and that it took reasonable steps to prevent its sale. The failure to comply with the Act and its prohibition of the sale of tobacco to minors were grounds for a fine. The appellant appealed. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred by applying an unreasonable high standard of due diligence. The court found that the appellant had taken all reasonable care in establishing proper system to stop their cashiers from selling tobacco to children and that they had taken reasonable steps. The sentence imposed was $3,000. The appeal was allowed and a verdict of an acquit was entered."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit in downtown warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. Building permits had not been obtained nor had condominium titles been raised at the time of sale. The appellant sold the unit to a third party purchaser for $1.5 million. The respondent later sold the project to third party purchasers for $2.5m. The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Chambers judge did not err in finding that the appellant possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event. The appellants were not entitled to rest his claim to a registrarable interest on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. The appellant was not entitled, at the outset, to a registration of a miscellaneous interest against the land against which the respondent registered. The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The applicant was not to rest any claim to the registrar's interest on a notion claim to right in 'Common property'."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., did operate a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. The issue was whether the Crown has shown that Chisums requires such a licence. The court found that the defendant had taken many steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in the log home packages. The Crown did not show that Chiselum requires such an application. The evidence was that the process utilized by the defendant was more than simply harvesting as it was defined in the legislation. The process utilized was morethan simply harvesting. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Court dealt with the placement of two brothers, M.S.S., and D.T., who were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and L.H., who had been apprehended from their care of the maternal grandparents. The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. HELD: The Court found that the boys were in the best interests of the children and that the best interest of the child was for them to be placed with their paternal grandparents."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","FIAT The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order. HELD: 1) The father is to pay $61,500 per month. The mother is to determine the ongoing child support amount. 2) The respondent father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 3) With respect to the capital gain shown on the father’s 2008 income tax return, I have determined that the capital loss is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the fathers 2008 Income Tax Return. It is well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis the severance package pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have."
c_2011skpc61.txt,"The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code. The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was charged with three counts of assault. The court found that the accused had a limited cognitive capacity, namely, that he could not recall the events of the alleged shooting, but that he was able to communicate with counsel. The Court found that he met the fitness test on the first two counts, namely understanding the nature of the proceedings and understanding the possible outcomes. The only issue was whether the accused met the test on a third count. The accused was found to have a major cognitive problem, which would make a fitness test fit in any event. The test for fitness to stand trial was 'limited cognitive capacity'. The Court held that the test for whether the Court could reasonably conclude that the Court was satisfied that the defendant met the criteria for fitness was'mutually unintelligible'. The court also held that, given the accused's extensive training and experience, he was not only able to comprehend the nature and the possible consequences of each of the allegations but also to communicate effectively with counsel and to make a determination on the fitness of the accused. The evidence showed that the court could not find the fitness to participate test fit with the test of 'limited capacity' as defined in R. v. Taylor. The conclusion that the trial judge was unable to determine whether the defendant's cognitive capacity met the requirement for fitness is not supported by the test. The trial judge's failure to make the determination was due to a lack of clarity and lack of ability to communicate. The defendant's failure would not meet the fitness requirement for a fitness to be tried test."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT. The court sought an order from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by the respondent company by the solicitor of the plaintiff for the indebtedness of the respondent's father and the corporation by the amount owing on the judgment. The solicitor had been advised by Eggum and Abrametz that his claim for a solicitor's lien against the shares in question was a writ of execution pursuant to a judgment in the Judicial Centre of Prince Alberta. The sheriff had been unable to enforce the judgment and the balance owing on it was $28,163.97 plus interest. The lawyer was also ordered to produce and deliver to the court the shares of the defendant company by way of a solicitor’s lien. The judge ordered the lawyer to produce the shares to the Sheriff within seven days of service. The plaintiff was advised to sell the shares. The defendant solicitor was to produce. The Court of Queen’S Bench found that the solicitor”s liens were valid and the court ordered the solicitor to produce, to the county sheriff, the outstanding solicitor‘s lian against the company and the shares that the plaintiff held in the company. The s. 21(1) of The Legal Profession Act had an application. The Sheriff was unable to obtain the shares and the plaintiff was ordered to pay the solicitor. The order was upheld. The issue was whether the solicitor had a valid solicitor“s lia (lien) on his shares and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the plaintiff” s. 66(3) of the Legal Profession act arose out of s. 1990. The Solicitor’ s. 1 of the Saskatchewan farm security act was also an application and the sheriff was unable, on application by the execution creditor, to enforce it. The matter was adjourned to September 2016. The trial judge was unable and the judge was unsuccessful in finding that the defendant solicitor had not breached his solicitor‚s lan. The issues before the court were whether the lawyer’d lien to prevail against the sheriff would afford the solicitor greater right than his clients to withhold documents from the receiver. The question was whether, under the Saskatchewan Act, the solicitor was exempt from seizures pursuant to The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. HELD: The court held that the s.21(1)(a) of s7(1 of"
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011. The accused had been in custody since he was arrested and was charged with trafficking. The offences were found to be proceeds of crime. The amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was in addition to the amount found in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. He was convicted of trafficking and possession of cocaine. The court awarded him credit for 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. The Court also awarded him one and one-half days credit for the time he had spent on remand awaiting trial. The sentencing judge found that the accused was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remanded awaiting trial and that he would have qualified for a one-third reduction in his sentence for good behaviour. The sentence imposed was not increased or reduced. The offender could and should have been brought to trial sooner. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the nature and quantity of the drugs found in Mr. Mullins' possession for purposes of the trafficking constitute an aggravating factor. The defendant had a previous drug related record and had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to do so. The evidence as came out in evidence did not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. The judge also gave the accused credit for his compliance with the terms of his sentence. The sentences imposed were in the range of 18 months to 4 years. The maximum credit for remand was given to the accused for 6.5 months. The remaining sentence was 6 months. 9 days."

The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim their damages are $5,975.95 but acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. The defendant denies his workmanship was poor and admits he performed portion of the work but was not allowed to finish the job or clean up. The plaintiffs claim they owe $580.00 for the damage done to their home. The plaintiff claims their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. The court declines to allow the counterclaim. The counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The Court finds the defendant's negligence is not malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The damage done by the defendant was not caused by the damage to the home."

In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative. HELD: The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not matter should be struck for want of prosecution in the case of International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg Ketilson. The court found that the delay from May 2000 to May 2012 was a delay from the time of application for the plaintiff's action to May 2011 and solely on the head of counsel for the defendant for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could lead the court on its own to strike. The defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is not in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The length of the inexcusable delay is simply a one-year period that it took the plaintiff’s counsel to respond to the undertaking. Here, some time would be expended in determining what undertakings could be responded to and what should be resisted. As examination for discovery were completed this is at an early stage that it would lead the Court on its Own to strike the claim."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.",This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence apply to s810 hearings. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court found that the usual criminal rules of the evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. The Court held that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. The Appeal Court held the Crown should have called the authors.

The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn. The evidence supports the Plaintiff's belief that the substance, either through run-off or leaching from the back alley, killed the lawn. However, the evidence does not support the Plaintiff’s claim. The respondent’ s witness testified that he had used the same type of herbicide in the past and that the back of the shed was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The plaintiff’d also testified that the respondent had used a soil sterilant in the yard prior to moving it to his yard. HELD: The Plaintiff‘s claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that the Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn.

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through nation wide outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. The respondent took about a year to prepare a franchise program to replace the existing agencies. The trial judge found that the appellant's projections were wrong. The respondents' argument was that the exclusionary clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of warranty. Appeal dismissed.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","The plaintiff and her son, who claimed to be the son of a doctor, had been living in the United States for 15 years. They had been married for 15 and a half years. The son, now 22, had recently graduated from high school and was pursuing a doctorate. The wife had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She was diagnosed with cancer. The defendant, who had finished his first law degree, had returned to India to study medicine. He had made some changes to his will, including deleting the bequest to his cousin in India. The plaintiff and son had been together for 15-plus years. Their relationship was tumultuous and they had difficulty reconciling their conflicting needs.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without having just cause as set out hereafter. The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is eligible to judgment. 1) The defendant put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the Rules. 2) The alleged misconduct of the defendant would not justify dismissal without a full cause as provided in the Act. The griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the defendant put forth a realistic analysis of an adequate notice period. Taking the factors into consideration, the Court considers this is an appropriate time to consider. Taking these factors into the context of Rule 488, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. Taking other factors into considerations, the court considers this an appropriate period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 3) The Court accepted the defendant’s description of the meeting and what was said by the plaintiff during the meeting. The alleged conduct would not be justified dismissal without the first time it came to the employer’S attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking on all factors, the notice period should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-managed one."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of the assault at a bar. The first question was answered in the affirmative. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct as the actions of the defendant. The second question was asked in the negative. HELD: The accused's conviction was found to be more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily damage. The court held that the second question should be answered in affirmative. The third question was easily answered in negative. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up from which the bodily injury resulted. Without the initial assault, no pile-ups would have resulted. The Court held that there was a substantial body of evidence, both expert and lay, before the jury indicating that the kick was at least contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that is all the Crown was required to establish."

d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for 17 years.

d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was not reasonably supported by the Crown's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept authorizations. The Crown argued that evidence of the offence was inadvertent and that admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused argued that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence was admissible because the breach was not serious and was inadvertence. The evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. The Court of Appeal held that there is no Charter violation. The respondent's applications were dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not breach the accused s.8 rights. 2)The respondent's evidence was non-conscriptive and did not constitute a breach of s.7(1) of the Charter. The court concluded that there had been no Charter breaches and that there were no Charter violations. The appellant's application was dismissed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench concluded that the respondent's argument was not supported by any evidence obtained pursuant to s.24(2) of The Charter. It was concluded that it was inadvertently and the evidence is admissible and ought not to be excluded. The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach, and the effect of exclusion were all considerations. The judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The matter was resolved in the Court of Justice's favour. 4)The Crown's arguments were not supported. The complainant consented to the interception of private communications and consented. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. 5)The court concluded there was a Charter breach. The officer who issued the authorization did not appear to have sufficient information before him. The issue was whether the evidence obtained under s8(2)(c) was admissible. 6)The appellant's evidence is relevant and inadadmissible. The information obtained as result of the telephone conversation is non-consecutive. The applicant's application for exclusion was dismissed"

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was in a direct conflict with the applicant. The continuing payment of the survivor payments is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to her in her personal capacity. Unless the Respondents agreed that the funds should be divided amongst the heirs, the Respondence would be required to bring an action against herself in her own personal capacity in her capacity. 2)The applicant's spouse is defined in s. 1.32 of the pension plan. The intestate is in a position of direct conflict. The Continuing Payment of the Survivor Benefits is an instant benefit to the applicant, which is lessened in the event the respondent agreed that they should be paid into the Estate and divided amongst all of the heirs. Unless there were steps to change the respondent’s status in law, she would be forced to bring action against her in the personal capacity as well. 3)The application must fail."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer who made the demand for a sample of the appellant's breath. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand, and the appellant had reasonable grounds to do so. The evidence was clear that the appellant was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night as well as all the indicia of impairment referenced. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provided ample evidence to support her belief the appellant operated his motor vehicle while his ability to do this was impaired.

d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Court of Queen's Bench found that the defendant had not shown adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender. The Court found that this finding was not supported by the experts' evidence. 2) The defendant had vacillated between positions involving the sexual offences. The court found that during the dangerous offender hearing the defendant failed to give adequate consideration the assessment by the two expert experts who both suggested that he was a longterm offender. 3) The Defendant was found to be a dangerous offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment programming. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the Court was not bound to accept the experts’ assessment. The evidence showed that the Defendant had not exhibited any significant anger or aggression towards the victims. The Defendant had been convicted of two sexual assaults. The trial judge found that he had not engaged in meaningful or meaningful acts of violence. The judge also found that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. The parties argued that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements protected by qualified privilege. The trial judge found the defamed statements were not defamatories but of being untrue. The plaintiff was awarded damages of approximately $50,000 for the defamation. The court also fixed general damages at $100,000 as the plaintiff's reputation would be lowered. The Court concluded that the defence of qualified privileged applies in this case. The claim for general damages was dismissed. The award of general damages is $100. The respondent's claim for damages is dismissed."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants answer certain questions. The plaintiff argues that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc., advised in respect of undertaking 28 that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and advised CN that they would advise. CN argues that this advice was improper and that the plaintiff's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. HELD: The court found that the questions posed were not an issue in the action. The court ordered the defendants to provide answers to the questions. It was clear that the insurance adjuster's file was subject to litigation privilege and that for proportionality reasons the plaintiff should not be required to answer the question. The Court found that when the defendants moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. The claim for negligence was not an important issue and the plaintiff was not required to provide proper responses."

Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff brought an amended claim for damages from overhanging trees on his property. The defendant argued that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood was generally in favour of them. The plaintiff claimed damages for root damage from the overhangs of trees to his yard. The defendants argued that this was a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for the damage to the plaintiff's property. This was clearly a remedy the Court had not jurisdiction to give. The court struck out the portion of the plaintiff’s claim for damage from overhang trees on the defendant’ s property. It was not a remedy that the Court could grant. The Court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was beyond the authority of the Court. The plaintiffs’ claim was frivolous and vexatious. The claim was not frivolous and was not in the context of community standards.

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S., 1967, c.126 in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of pickled whole herring. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. The appellant argued that the Minister and the Provincial tax commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full.

As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain.

She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement terms in regard to the sharing of the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant in the amount of $33,800. The defendant argued that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was not obligated to share the proceeds. The plaintiff argued that it was the agreement that was the only reference to the word 'fluid' in the agreement. The agreement provided that the defendant would only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid. The plaintiffs argued that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it was obligated to only share the sale proceeds from that sale of the Fluid milk Quota. The defendants argued that they were not obligated because the agreement did not refer to Flud. The court found that the plaintiff was not in a conflict position. The parties agreed that the terms of the agreement were one and the same. The Court ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiff with the information necessary to make the agreement binding. The evidence showed that the agreements were not signed in any way that would have affected the plaintiff's ability to run the operation. The only agreement that the parties agreed upon was that the respondent and the respondent would share proceeds of the sale from the purchase of Flud and the quota sold.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The dealer and the defendant farm cooperated in 1997 and 1997. The defendant farm was reduced to 2000 acres in 1997. In 1997, the defendant acquired a sprayer. Its value was agreed to be $94,600. The dealer and defendant entered into a standard form Finance Lease Agreement (FLEA) in 1997, which provided for an advance payment of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until December 15 2001. The trade-in was agreed for $23,650. The plaintiff argued it was a lease and that Case Credit's right was restricted to repossession and sale by s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-ins as the advance payment even though the value of the trade did not equal the amount of the advance. The agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to pay the final payment. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a leasing or a security agreement. The parties framed the Agreement as a lease, but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay a capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest in the spray, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of the Act and the liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two. The issues were whether the agreement is a lease or a lease. The issue was the central issue. The plaintiffs claim it is a 'lease' and that it is restricted to the repossession by s.(2) s.46(2). The construction of the agreement was not a question for the court to determine. The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest. The terms of the contract were a 'conditional sales contract' whereby title reserved until Mr. Prentice elected to make the final payments. The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value of a spray in June 2002 and in June 2001, to be paid at Mr. Mr.Poirier's option if he elected to purchase the spray. The termination value was not determined by the anticipated value of new unit. The value of option payment was not"
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.",The appellant and respondent were married for ten years. Two children were born out of the marriage. The respondent and the appellant separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. The applicant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The issue was whether the definition was an analogous ground upon which to base a claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of The Charter. The Court held that the definition in s2(g)(i) of MPA did not apply to the appellant because they did not come within the definition. The Act also allows judges to make an unequal division in some cases. The application was saved by s. of the Charter.
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.",HELD: The Court held that the evidence was admissible as similar fact evidence and that the prejudicial nature of the evidence had not been overcome. The Court also held that there was a risk that the similar fact information would distract the jury from their proper focus on the second degree murder charge and that it would lead them to equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required to be convicted of murder. The court also held there was an issue for which the Crown sought to adduce the evidence. The evidence was found to be admissible on the basis of its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. The prejudicial aspects of the similar facts evidence had been overcome by its probativity value and should not in any way be admitted.

The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appealed the sentence of $200.00 and a $30 victim surcharge. The sentence was varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim sur charge in the amount of $30. The Crown had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Code. HELD: The sentence varied to reflect an order that the respondent pay a $20 victim surtax in the amounts of $20. The court gave reasons for the variation. The sentencing judge failed to comply with the explicit provisions of s. 730(5), and (6) of Code. The Court gave reasons in the record of the proceedings. The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 6 of the Criminal Code is mandatory subject only to an application under s 737(6) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharges, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons. If a defendant is exempted, it's also mandatory to give reasons for why the sentencing judge did not comply with s. 8 of the code. The offence was committed under section 730 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The defendant was convicted of failing to attend and complete anger management program as required by probation order. The respondent was sentenced to a fine of $300.00. The trial judge waived the victim fee in the sum of $50. The victim surcharged was also waived notwithstanding that the Respondent had not asked an exemption. The offender was exempted from paying the victim charge. The judge failed in his duty to act in the best interests of the offender. The sentences varied to vary to include the order requiring a victim to pay $30 in the order of the Crown. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did fail to comply. The maximum sentence for a serious offence under the Criminal Procedure Code is 15 years imprisonment. The amount of the surcharge is mandatory in an application for an application of 737(7). The imposition is mandatory to an Application under s741(5). If an offenders is exempted by default from payment, it was also mandatory for the court to give the reasons. The failure to comply is of paramount importance to the offender and the entire criminal justice system. The costs of this offence are of paramount significance. The burden of paying the surcharges is on the offender to pay the surtax."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The Union resists the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the indemnities by-law and, more importantly, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is entitled, albeit indirectly, to resolve its own disputes. HELD: The Court held that the dispute was not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The Court found that the Union was entitled to indemnity under the by-laws. The dispute was also not within its exclusive realm. The court ordered the plaintiff to pay costs. The union argued that it would be clearly wrong and an error in law to interpret the indemnis clause so as to obligate the plaintiff in his activity of suing the Union. The argument between the plaintiff and the Union centered around the bylaws of the Union, not the by law. The only inference to draw is that the members at that meeting knew that they were paying for the cost of the defence of the First Action but also the counterclaim contained in the First. The action was dismissed. 1) The Court ordered the Court to consider dismissing the plaintiff's claim. The issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled, as the plaintiff is involved, to the benefits of the by the indemn indemnity by-laws. The question on this appeal is whether the Court has jurisdiction over an action for damages brought against the union by one of its members alleging breach of contract by the union in violating the hiring hall rules governing the allocation of jobs among unemployed union members. The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, the court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff’’ claim and his application under Queen”s Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The court found that it was clearly wrong in law and an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the union” s indemnity. The principles of statutory interpretation supported the claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred. The analysis in the analysis in Street v. B.C. School Sports was not germane to the within debate. 3) The Union asks that if the Court concludes, as have done, that it has jurisdiction under"
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children. The respondent argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. The petitioner argued that retroactive support should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The appellant argued that this was the year the respondent first applied for the change in circumstances and that the respondent should disclose the material change in circumstance to the court. The court did have jurisdiction, however, to deal with the claim for retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the petitioner's older child. The Court held that the Court had jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactivity of child support if any will be calculated for the younger child. It held that jurisdiction was not required to grant the respondent any relief. The issue was whether the respondent had the means to justify his/her obligation to pay child support. The evidence established that the petitioner and her partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The trial judge was not blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. The issues raised by the petitioner were whether the appellant's obligation to contribute to the support of the younger children was increased, whether the petitioner had a blameworthy conduct conviction, and whether the conduct of the petitioner could be acquitted by buying his/ her child a bicycle. The question was whether there was a sufficient basis for the respondent to make an application for retroactively child support, and if so, what the basis for that application was. The only conclusion was that the appellant had not made a sufficient case for the retroactive award. The fact that the parties' children had not been independent, financially and otherwise from their parents was irrelevant. The matter was whether retroactive payments should be made to the petitioner if the respondent's obligation changed but his payments did not. The applicant's evidence was speculative and conjecture. The judge was unable to provide any other evidence as to the respondent’s financial situation. The respondents’ evidence was not speculative and speculative."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company sought and obtained information relating to the sale of a shopping mall. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of the fair value of the property and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not reach the conclusion that the sale was an arm's length sale, as the sale price did not reflect typical market value transactions as required by the adjustment provisions of the Assessment Manual. The appellant company appealed its 2003 assessment. The appeal was dismissed on several grounds alleging error of law on the part of the Committee. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties and are called upon to make number of decisions largely on the basis of fact that emerges through this process, process provided for by sections 171 and 172 of The Cities Act. Nor was the Committee convinced the Committee had erred in relation to the determination of a sale price. 2) The committee did not misappreciate the importance of the sales verification process. The committee failed to take into account the importance the sale's information and the accuracy of the information provided by the parties to the transaction. The fact that Cadillac Fairview transferred an undivided one half interest in the mall to the appellant company was not a material error. The assessment of the Normanview Mall came to rest on the City assessor's determination and application of the Sale Verification Information. The sale price was determined by the City's assessment of its fair value. The City's decision to transfer the remaining interest in a shopping centre was not based on the sale sale price but rather on the assessment of a mall. 3) The assessment was based on a single sale price and the sale value was determined using the sale sales of four enclosed shopping malls. The city's decision was based upon the sale prices of the four enclosed malls. 4) The appeal to the assessor was dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that the Committee erred. The court was not convinced that the committee erred when it concluded that the City had not properly considered the sale. The issue was whether the Committee's conclusions were correct. The evidence presented in the form of the Sales Agreement for the mall was not part of that sale. 5) The Court found that the assessment was not in error."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine was granted. The court found that the application for cross-examination was not supported by the evidence obtained by way of affidavit material filed by the plaintiff. The Court found that cross- examination was not appropriate in this case because the plaintiff was not a representative plaintiff. It found that there was no need for clarification through cross- questioning. The plaintiff was merely a representative for the class. The defendant applied for leave. The cross-and-examination would assist the court in applying the criterion set out in ss. 6 and 6.1 of The Class Actions Act to the certification application. The application was granted on the basis that the common issues being advanced for certification were not the individuals under 18 who took Paxil, but by the corporate health care plans, health care insurers and provincial health departments. The common issues were not only devoid of the allegations of harm in the statement of claim but also inconsistent with the plaintiff's personal expectations and motivation. The examination of the affidavit material may assist the Court in applying s. 6.6 of The Act to this application."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

He did not remain at the scene of the collision. He admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene. The respondent appealed the decision of the Romanian court, which overturned the sentence of his previous conviction. The appellant appealed the sentence and the trial judge sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment. The trial judge in Saskatoon found that the appellant had not committed any crimes and the appellant's current circumstances did not raise the risk of his non-appearance. The application was dismissed. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the appellant’s claim for a judicial interim detention. The petitioner’ s. 43 statement was not frivolous and the court found the respondent’d submissions to be not frivolous. The issue was whether the appellant should be released from custody pending the Minister’S decision on his surrender to Romania. The Court found that it would be non-sensical for the appellant to flee prior to the Minister making his decision on surrender. The appeal court judge also found that his appeal was not motivated by the appellant. The Crown conceded that the petitioner had met this low threshold. The Canadian Court of Appeal was not empowered to delve into the validity of the proceedings against the applicant or assess, other than in limited way, the merits of the appeal.

He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.

He was driving a truck at the time of the collision and had been involved in a construction project. The truck driver had been charged with careless driving and operating a vehicle in an undiagnosed manner. The Crown had not identified the stopped vehicles and the driver had not been aware of them. The Court was satisfied that the accused had not committed any dangerous driving offences. The court found that the defendant had committed no dangerous driving offence. The defendant's unlawful conduct must be denounced. The Criminal Code provides that a sentence must be just and fair and consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction. The offences were found to be in the range of dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm. The offender was found to have been operating a semi truck in a dangerous manner.
