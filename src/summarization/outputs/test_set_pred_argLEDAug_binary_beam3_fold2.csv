1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant was encouraged to take responsibility for her own affairs and to continue her efforts to find employment. 2)The trial judge did not refer to the significant evidence of the respondent's accountant which indicated that his projected annual income for the respondent was $32,000. That is not enough to prove that substantial variations in the income of a self-employed business man could occur. It was impossible to imagine under any circumstances that a substantial change in his earning power could occur such as that which was not shown to be more than temporary foreseeable ups and downs in the financial life of a businessman. 3)There was truly finality to the financial relationship between the parties. The principles enunciated in Pelech were not applied only to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. There was also an element of unforeseeability by the parties as a result of the consensual arrangement. 4)The appeal should be allowed in any circumstances where the court could intervene and set aside the judgment."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff, Phoenix, applied for the dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin that it would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant and was therefore not relevant. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the plaintiff had failed to provide the defendant with the information requested. The court found that the defendant had used the scales in its calculation of the value of the sealife III landings and, in some cases, had intentionally misled the plaintiff by failing to disclose them."

However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.

1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1)The Committee was mandated under the Act to determine whether the cardiologist's pattern of medical practice was acceptable to it considering that his billings to medicare were out of line with the billings by the other cardiologists in the province. 2)There was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the Committee's involvement in the hearing conducted by the Director and the Committee in preference to the uncontroverted expert evidence. 3)All of the evidence presented was uncontroverted with one possible exception. The Committee's decision was not placed before the Court for a judicial review. 4)It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose the duty to act fairly and to provide procedural fairness. 5)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee."

The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who had denied liability for the fire that erupted in his grandparents' trailer.

When he returned to the residence, he found it already in flames and rushed to the grandparents' house to have them call the fire department. The defendant called several witnesses including two employees of the defendant's investigation unit. They all found their evidence to be suspect and their testimony has played no part in the defence of the action. HELD: The defendant was found to have met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and had established that the fire was deliberately set. While there is no direct evidence to establish that the defendant set the fire himself, the defendant must establish by a balance of probabilities commensurate with the occasion. The more unlikely or improbable the allegation required to be proved, the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood or improbability."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The parties were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 that established employee salaries for the period 1994 to 1996. The agreement provided that all employees would be paid a lump sum as a result of the expiration of the wage freeze. The union sued the employer for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the employer's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge dismissed the application. The court's jurisdiction was limited to the arbitrator's jurisdiction and the action could be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada in appropriate circumstances. There were four considerations that supported the conclusion that, where there is doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration."

TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the defendant. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the applicant whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement.

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had babysat the complainant for two years. At the time of the alleged assault, the complainant was living common law with her mother. The parties had retired to the bedroom where the accused retired to sleep. The Court found that the complainant had been asleep at the accused daughter's apartment when she awoke. During the evening, the accused and the daughter had had a conversation about some trivial matters and the complainant's recollection of the event was not clear-cut. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged, which the Court was not persuaded on the total evidence. HELD: The accused was found not guilty as charged. On the evidence before the court, it was reasonable to conclude that the girl would not be conscious of her immediate surroundings and would be unable to identify any causative agent unless that medium or effect was still in progress when she became consciously and emotionally aware of her surroundings. The Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the information tried tried that the offence was tried. The court found that when the complainant is asleep the accused is not capable of being conscious of his immediate surroundings. Therefore, the Court finds that it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt that he sexually assaulted the complainant or touched her for a sexual purpose, or at all.

2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction on a theft charge where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)The conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrine of recent possession.  2)There was conflicting evidence as to whether one person could lift the generator onto a truck without assistance or whether it was too heavy and awkward. This was not a critical issue. 3)The appellant argued on the appeal that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced in or implicitly consented to the Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction by agreement. The appellant argued that the conviction should be vacated and sentence imposed in the Court of Appeal in preference to having the proceedings in the Provincial Court declared null."

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.",The appellant single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant was not married at the time of the daughter's birth and remains single. The child's father has had no contact with her nor has he provided any child support since November 2000. There is no evidence as to why there has been no contact between the child and her father since 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It is not known how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her current job. The father was not notified of the adoption application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister made no recommendation with regard to the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The mother chose not to take any position on the appeal. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with her father whether the adoption was granted or not. The appeal was dismissed with reasons.
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care of the child with access to her former spouse and (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month. HELD: 1) The parties agree the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. The petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. The reality remains that in order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility largely onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay $700 per month to the respondent, 71% of those costs which is monthly sum $125, in the event the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the respondent's plan. 2) The respondent is no longer expected to contribute to child support. The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the father's income.  3) The petitioner shall pay 71 % of the childcare costs which are $125 for the two parties. 4) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. However, the evidence is conflicting. Accordingly, the respondent urges that the economic disparity in household incomes and post-separation lifestyles leave her with a need of $1,350 per month, while the petitioner attempted to mediate and negotiate resolution of issues, thereby reducing the need and cost of additional childcare, a logical reason to place the entire cost of daycare as an expense to be borne by the petitioner and not an offset."
2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Act. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s. 225(1). He complains about the manner in which the activities of the corporation have been conducted. In this jurisdiction such a review is discretionary. 3) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. 4) In Abrahamson v. Baker and Smishek (1964), 1964 CanLII 380 (Sask. C.A.). 5) The substantive issues distill to whether Robin Mowat has standing under ss. 135(2)(b) of the Non-profit Corporations act, 1995 declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The fact that the respondent gave notice of intention to seek judicial review as early as April 2006 and then dismissed the decision of the Elections Board and substituted its own judgment and ratified the referendum, which was therefore not a referendum. 6) There is no question CFS had an interest in the subject matter and could be adversely affected by the judgment. In its assessment, the applicant is'member' even by the respondent's definition. 7) Although there is no definition of an 'election' in the Act, the Court may make any interim order it considers appropriate, including an order requiring the respondent to ratify the referendum results. 8) In the circumstances, the application to strike portions of the affidavits submitted on behalf of others is not the end of the matter. In the alternative, the respondent could convene a Board of Directors meeting and vote on whether or not to make a declaration that the referendum was of no consequence or force to be held. 9) In this case the EB is the ultimate decision maker. It is academic given the relief available to the applicant. If the applicant does have standing, is he entitled to the relief sought?"
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The case has much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. 3) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. While the defendants appeared to have achieved their major objectives, namely a guaranteed price for his equipment, and a sale in their competitor's backyard, all of them were apparently too busy to attend to details. 4) The plaintiff's alleged breaches were not central to the decision in the final analysis."
2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","The court found that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. Both parties bore their own costs, which included disbursements and pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. The defendant sought $10,000 in trial costs, $850 in previously awarded costs, and $5,092.57 in prejudgment interest for total of $26,630.81. It was important that courts support Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. However, in this case, the plaintiff had no confidence that any offer made by either defendant, short of 100% vindication, would have resolved the case in advance of trial."
2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The declaration that the two children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and their father's obligation to pay proportional amount of post-secondary expenses for the child of their marriage was set-off at the amount of $100 per month for child care expenses until such time as the parties were able to arrange for a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The father sought to have the child support payments continue and an order eliminating the father's child support arrears be made payable directly to the mother. The parties agreed that given the age of the children, their age difference and the father’s income, the guideline amount payable by the father was $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expenses. HELD: 1) The father was to pay $500 per month in the interim for child support and then $200 per month towards ongoing child support for the said child and then towards the arrear of his child.  2) In the case of Rebenchuk v. Bradley, 2008 SKQB 70, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the age where support automatically terminates. It can now be stated that the following three steps need to be addressed: Step 1: Paying child support; 2) Making payments towards the ongoing support for Keegan; 3) Paying the father a portion of the $2,667 in monthly child support payable for the other two children in the marriage in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; and 4) applying the table amount in the Guidelines “inappropriate” to the father. This amount should be divided among the parties."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC.

The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they moved on two occasions. The petitioner gave no notice to the respondent of the intended move and he returned home without any warning or note. The house was in disarray and he feared that robbery had occurred and that his wife and children were injured or abducted. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident here. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia. 2)The persons who can attest to the professional, social and family circumstances of the child children reside in the Province of British Columbia where they have lived all of their lives. It is likely that their teacher, playmates, schoolmates, grandparents, school professionals and others, including the paternal grandmother, may be called to testify about facts and circumstances bearing on the children's best interests. 3)There was no evidence about the schooling of the son, nor of the career plans of the petitioner, or of the care to be provided to the two children while she may be out of the home working.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R was the sole financial benefit for this activity to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: Pursuant to subparagraph 57(1)(b)(ii), the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and properly recoverable. 1)The law of contract clearly recognizes that there is a consignment contract between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the consignment dealer (Triple R). There is also a contract (the sales contract) between Mr. Dillabough (the vendor) and Mr. Finch (the purchaser). However, in the circumstances the plaintiff did reject the goods. He was not entitled to any of the warranties set out in the Act.  2)The consignee was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly Triple R is deemed to have given to him the warranties under the warranties. 3)The plaintiff did not reject the products within a reasonable period of time. The dealer bore the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and had failed to do so.  4)The automobile was not used after the plaintiff learned of its very serious problems. If it had been the intention of the Legislature in passing this legislation to exclude consignees, it would have listed them in the excluded group.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The children have been returned. 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and Joshua. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention it was replaced by replacing it with a 'chasing order'. Once it has concluded that child has been wrongfully removed or retained the Hague Convention mandates the court to order the child's return forthwith unless the case fits into one of the exceptions set forth in s. 12, 13 or 20. There is a crystalizing moment in time for the Court to determine the status quo prior to leaving that State should be restored, i.e. each parent having equal rights to the child. 3) In all cases to which the Court was drawn by counsel, the children had been ordered returned. It was appropriate to impose some sort of condition on the petitioner as evidencing his timeliness and keen interest in maintaining his/her relationship with the child and to assist in determining habitual residence."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the primary care of two children who were in the mother's care. The mother, who was working as a roofer, claimed the children were not receiving appropriate parenting. The father, who had no driver's license and was unable to drive a motor vehicle, was dependent upon the maternal grandparents to transport the children for medical and dental appointments and from time to time, there was no running water in his home. The grandparents, who were also the primary caregivers, suffered from severe depression and anxiety. They were unable to attend school, work, school, or play with the children. Their relationship with family members and friends was at risk because of the father's drug use. The children, while in the care of the mother, were exposed to daily and troublesome drug use by the father. Their physical well being was compromised by his daily drug use, and their mental health was most likely to continue to be compromised by this habit. Their current primary care and control arrangement is with the mother. If the mother continues to smoke drugs regularly and financially support a drug habit, this will automatically divert funds available to adequately provide amenities for the children and, in the present circumstances, the Court is convinced that the father is unable to meet the needs of his children on a daily basis. As the mother has made significant mistakes in the past, this is an unfavorable factor for placement of the children with their mother. HELD: The Court held that if a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a marijuana habit, the circumstances of this would lead to an adverse effect on the children's short and long term care. As long as the mother remains compliant with her treatment plan, the children will be at risk. The Court was satisfied that the mother had made significant errors in her own care and therefore the Court was compelled to take this opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a joint custody arrangement between the parties. Therefore, this decision will only address the salient evidence before the Court with an apparent nexus to the welfare of the two young boys."
2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and makes several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior before the commencement of the divorce proceedings.HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. 1) Rule 62.15 has no application in this case because the decision of the respondent was merely declaratory and does not call for or contemplate any consequential relief or require the taking of any further steps to enforce his declaration. There simply are no 'proceedings under the order appealed from' to be granted. 2) There is no comprehensive definition of 'exceptional circumstances' for Fulton's secondary test. It applies only when required in the interests of justice and it is exceptional in the sense that it permits the court to avoid an injustice in circumstances which escape the attention of the primary test. 3) While there is a common law test that goes to the heart of an application, this one was not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with the Rule."
2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment in May 2004. In the fall of 2005, the mother, who had recently graduated from an American university, applied to vary the amount of child support payable by the husband (who had previously received $3,100.00 per month from the Canadian Scholarship Trust) to the three children (all of whom were now children of the marriage). The husband argued that the change in circumstances related to the marriage that would, had it been known at the time of the original order, resulted in a different order of spousal support, which the mother contested. She also alleged that her health began deteriorating after the marriage, as she was performing the multiple roles of mature student, and day to day parent of the two girls (who were then home) and had been depressed and suicidal. The husband sought to vary child support based on his current income (which he had received from the CSTF). He argued that he did not know the current exchange rate and that it would be appropriate to vary it only if the wife had graduated from her university program and there was no medical evidence of their or the mother's post-crash condition that impacted on her ability to pursue self-sufficiency. The application to vary spousals was dismissed. The parties had made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The mother had stopped paying child support when the husband made his first variation order in 2005. She now resided in the United States and the parties were trying to reconcile. The father's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month based on the respondent's salary and $203,706.00 Can. Based on the information before the court, the Court could not conclude that the children's grades deteriorated to any significant degree since the divorce. The respondent's obligation to provide support to the children was terminated in June 2002. It is not appropriate that the respondent continued to make monthly provision for payment to these plans until the Court discovered that the defendant had cashed them in. The appropriate adjustment to the payment to both William and Rosamond will be made according to the terms of this judgment for January 2007."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were found to have either one or more bent web members or were not compliant with the National Building Code. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation expenses. The defendant, claiming that the defects were caused by the respondent's negligence, undertook remediation of the mall. Awarding the defendant $285,000 for the costs of the remediation, that the respondent failed to maintain or improve the quality of the joists; $75,000 was awarded to the respondent for general inspection and $75 in repairs. The court was not satisfied with the evidence presented by the respondents. The respondent admitted that he fabricated the open web joists in the Mayflower Mall, but claimed that he did not have the time to inspect them. In addition, he was aware the respondent advertised their joists as complying with CSA (Canadian Standards Association) W59 Standard. HELD: The issue was whether there were any real and substantial danger to the occupants of the Mall, as the failure rate was 1% or less. Based on the opinion of several experts, the court was unable to say how many times the respondent conducted joist inspections. The evidence was that many of the cracks were not service related. The failure rates were high, but the respondent had not been properly informed of the range of acceptable welds and the issue was not resolved until the respondent retired. As the respondent continued to work on the project, it became apparent that he would not be able to keep up with the demand for his work. As many as 10,000 joists were inspected annually. In the fall of 1995, the roof in Mount Pearl, Newfoundland collapsed and the respondent, who had been hired by the plaintiff, began to see cracks in his joists. He visited the scene several times in the spring and in the summer, when the roof deck was raised, he could not see the welds. He saw puddle welds on the bottom and top chords, as well as cracks on the top and bottom chords. He could not get a tape measure to look at them. He was not able to determine the age of the weld. He testified that he had not seen any marked increase in the number of welds since the beginning of the project. In his opinion, the respondent was over-reacting to the fact that there had been no prior inspection prior to the commencement of the inspection. He concluded that there were no signs of the failure that were noted in the"

HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.  1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers. Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA, 'applicant' or'respondent') seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The appellant consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant investment dealer (IDA) has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. HELD: The application for intervention is allowed with some strict conditions. The applicant must have served and filed its factum on or before March 6, 2007. The parties may file and serve their material by fax in order to expedite matters. The mere fact the proposed intervenor has additional arguments to make is not determinative of the issue. The application to intervene shall be made to the Court on notice to all parties and other interveners in the proceeding.

2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the two youngest children returned to the respondent, but this arrangement continued to the present. The petitioner now sought to recover the cost of orthodontist fees, which are extraordinary and should be included in the child support payments. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance was to be treated as income for the purposes of child support payable in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. 2) The respondent was to forthwith pay to the petitioner as court costs the sum of $1,200. 3) It will be fair if the contributions are equal, taking into account that the incomes are presently comparable. It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation be effected. 4) The petitioner claimed for full day's wages in 2004. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for one-half the time in any event. In addition, she claimed for her gross wages. The monthly difference was $270. 5) Taking into account all of the circumstances, the nature of the farming operation, the type and vintage of the machinery, and the rate at which the allowance is being used up, it is reasonable that 40% of the allowance should be treatedas income for child support. The fees are ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic support calculation. The same applies to certain activities provided to the child Mandey by the respondent when the parties separated."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the driver of the vehicle. HELD: 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at the time the individuals got into the vehicle, Ms. Neigel was the designated driver. The police officer was adamant and unshaken on the main points of the evidence. The fact that the police officer's keys were in the ignition when the group entered the vehicle (as opposed to the other officers' evidence that the vehicle was running and they had just pulled the vehicle out of the back lane) did not result in a finding of reasonable doubt. 2) The defence evidence lacks reliability. The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court was absolutely satisfied of the facts. The officer was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the defence witness caused the Court to have considerable concern."

3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and sought the return of the accused's right to a jury trial. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence as a witness was not sufficient to show that the accused would give relevant evidence to a decisive or potentially decisive issue. The court considered the circumstances of the offence, the previous record of the appellant and the remarks of the trial judge. It could not be said that the eight years imprisonment was not a fit sentence in this case."

The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence.

The trial judge misinterpreted the evidence, which was based on the accused's own evidence with respect to what alcohol he had to consume. She applied the correct principles of law in relation to the evidence of the police and alcohol consumption and found that the trial judge was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision.

Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the pleadings and at trial were: 1)Is there a valid lease agreement between the plaintiff and his deceased father? (b)If so, was the lease repudiated by the plaintiff; and 2)Was the plaintiff entitled to reimbursement from the estate on a quantum meruit basis for the value of his farm labour and if so, what was the quantum of his claim.  2)In the circumstances the fact the plaintiff did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land in 1993 does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. 3)The $17,800 mortgage (and interest) granted by the father to clear his land from the Bank of Montreal mortgage is not debt enforceable by the estate.  4)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the farm in accordance with the lease in 1993. He did nothing to protest the debt which had been defaulted on by his father. He participated actively in the estate's efforts to clear its land titles. However, he was not able to produce any documents to show that he had been reimbursed for his contributions in the past few years. Nor was it possible that he would pay his father for fuel if he was doing the farm work for his father without compensation.  5)The issues were not typical 'estate' issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate."
3_1996canlii6774.txt,"Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The two doctors were both practicing medicine together in Wolseley, Saskatchewan, since 1973. They had seven children, all of whom were studying for university degrees. The bankrupt had declared unsecured creditors but the trustee had determined that the actual amount was $138,109.70 of which was the claim of Revenue Canada. The bankruptcy judge ordered that the doctors should make combined payments of $1,250 per month on the first day of each and every month for a total of 36 months. Based on Revenue Canada's Superintendents Guideline of Payments (which the trustee took into account along with all other factors), their monthly family income after-tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $3,349 per month for the benefit of creditors. If the bankrupt consented to judgment there would be ajudgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000 which was entirely the Revenue Canada claim. HELD: The consent judgment option under s.172(2)(c) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve."
3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","A complaint of sexual harassment, based on the employment relationship of the employees, was filed with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. The Board of Inquiry was appointed by the Minister of Justice pursuant to s29(2) of the Code to investigate the complaint. It applied for judicial review contending the provisions of the code were superseded by the collective agreement and that a 'labour tribunal' appointed under the collective agreements had exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the complaint.(1) The parties had included a covenant to comply with the terms of their collective agreement in the interim. This agreement provided for the resolution of all disputes by final and binding arbitration. The fact that the parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the agreement does not alter the essential character of the dispute. It is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed, except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it proclaims. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter remitted to the board of inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions under the Human Rights Code. 1) The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the problem from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. 2) Common law jurisdiction was ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The decision of the Court of Appeal was based upon the principles of deference that courts accord to specialized tribunals."
3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to consider that the complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which had not been acted upon. Evidence of previous sexual activity is irrelevant to either credibility or consent. 2)The relevance of a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by N.M. in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility.  3)The Crown contends that the intent of the section is to protect the privacy of any sexual activity of complainant and that right should just as appropriately extend to instances where that person is the victim of an assault. This is not a case which calls for an analysis of extensive evidence, rather it is dependant entirely upon finding of credibility and reliance upon the testimony of one person recalling an incident which occurred nearly ten years earlier. One cannot accurately assess what the result would have been if the cross- examination had been allowed, however, it is enough to warrant new trial if the failure to present this evidence may reasonably have had an influence on the judge's conclusion."
3_1999canlii12632.txt,"A provisional order from the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench required the respondent to pay monthly support based on his income of $55,000 for the couple's two children. He was also required to pay half of the monthly dental expenses. Subsequently, the respondent filed a financial statement showing his income to be $50,064. HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines. The respondent is also required to maintain health and dental insurance for his children through his employer. The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims. The provisional order was confirmed subject to these specified variations.",The defendant was ordered to pay $794 per month as basic child support for two children.

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). At issue was whether the court had jurisdiction to deal with the issue of whether the plaintiffs were bound by the provisions of the collective agreement or not. HELD: The statement of claim was struck out. The court reviewed the various factors set out in the decision and concluded that the issues were matters which fall within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the Trade Union Act. The Court of Appeal noted that the recent decision in Nova Scotia in Pleau v. Canada (Attorney General) set out three interrelated considerations governing the determination whether the Court should decline jurisdiction in favour of the grievance/arbitration process. 1)There was no question that the individual contracts/rights (whether pre-existing or not) are fully replaced by the collective agreements and the Union's status as exclusive bargaining agent under labour relations legislation. The collective agreement does not provide for demotions except under proceedings taken under the Police Act. Further, even if the parties had explicitly agreed that demotions could take place for administrative reasons, the plaintiffs would still say such an agreement constitutes a violation of the police Act. There must be some means for a union member to challenge provisions in a collective agreement where they believe a statute has been contravened. This is especially so when it is considered whether there is an effective remedy. 2)The plaintiffs were not left without remedy."
3_2003nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company sued the defendants for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract alleging that the defendants sold it a piece of land smaller than what it was represented to be. The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available. Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","The appellants sought better particulars of general damages (Civil Procedure Rule 14.24) in an interlocutory order dismissing their application for further particulars of the general damage claim. The respondent had purchased the property in 1996 and used it for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation. The appellants claimed the property misrepresented its boundaries and plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected. The defendants in the Supreme Court action also demanded better particulars, alleging a breach of contract. The Chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application, dismissing the appeal with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. It was the respondent's position that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The question was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who observed the incident. 2)The trial judge was correct to find that there was no direct evidence to implicate the appellants. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It was fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found. 3)The appellants' argument that the Crown failed to present an offence of assault was supported by their evidence. 4)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The deceased's family requested an independent review of the medical files of three individuals who had been treated by the Regional Hospital for the purpose of internal evaluation, education and improvement of hospital care and practices.

The rest of the money was earmarked for future performance improvement. The appellants sought to recover the $15,000 awarded to the hospital for general damages. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence that the hospital or its doctors were aware of the nature of the peer reviews, nor did they have any expectation that they would be published. In fact, many of the physicians who were approached by the families said they expected the report to be confidential. Others indicated they would refuse to participate. In any event, the report was to be released to the families. As far as the physicians were concerned, they were to be responsible for the care, diagnosis and treatment of the deceased.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and for operating a motor vehicle when his blood level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. At trial the Crown tendered a certificate of analysis establishing that the accused was impaired by alcohol or drug, and an affidavit of service by Constable L. P.

In argument questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence in respect of the copy given to the accused which he had not yet seen.

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","This appeal against sentence must be allowed. The offence is breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. The breach consisted in violation of the term of the recognizances which prohibited the appellant from consuming alcohol. The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia. HELD: A period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of a term which prohibits him from consuming booze is inappropriate since it had no relation to the original s.810.ance, and does not have any other purpose.

4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of interim applications and interim orders since the separation, most of which related to the husband's failure to secure or pay support. The parties entered into a partial agreement and settlement in 2000 which provided for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care. The husband had taken out plans through employment to provide coverage for the children and the parties had not had any lengthy period of financial stability throughout their entire 14 years of cohabitation. The Divorce Act requires priority be given to support of children and if the parties have not had that, a Corollary Relief Judgment will be issued. HELD: 1) The parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Quite possibly, s.15(3) of the Divorce act would have been invoked as a result. However, they have not. 2) The husband's income for the purposes of child support was fixed at $6,875 U.S. per month and the bonus feature of $625 was invoked as part of his bonus. The wife's income was reduced to $1,800 per month for holidays with the husband. 3) Access costs as agreed by the parties were entirely and solely the responsibility of the husband and to be adjusted accordingly. He must keep himself current with respect to child support. His use of a credit card for access and other expenses is entirely his personal choice. It is very clear that these parties have no financial stability whatsoever. They would be foolish not to curtail short term assistance in the form of a share in the value of any one of the parties' assets. 4) It is an exceptional situation that requires some adjustment. It must be acknowledged that if the Agreement contained a level of support consistent with the Federal Child Support Guidelines and had been in form acceptable to the Prothonotary Office, then quite probably the divorce judgment would have issued as of that date and the Corollaries Relief Judgment would also have been issued. There would not be any jurisdiction remaining open for the court to make a limited realistic adjustment to their Agreement."

Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery.

The plaintiffs sought an interim payment of damages. Awarding the plaintiff $250,000, that the court has a discretionary power to order an interim payments from the defendants, based on its opinion of the amount of damages recovered by the plaintiff by the time of the accident (which is nearing the $300,000 mark). The plaintiff's claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the defendant did not yet even form part of the pleadings. The court was unable to form an opinion of what damages were likely to recover by the defendant at a final assessment of damages and it was not appropriate to order this interim payment."

HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had given instructions in 1998 for a never-completed will and had a small stroke few days before the will was signed. The doctor testified that in his opinion the doctor could instruct and complete last will and testament at that time. Evidence now before the Court by one of the witnesses to the will that he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will 2 and 1/2 years before he signed the will, he had instructed the lawyer to make a very different will, one which was never signed because of family pressure. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs.  1)There is a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors have provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the father. 2)There was nothing out of ordinary about the circumstances surrounding the will. The deceased had given the instructions for 1998 and then changed his mind. 3)Two and one-half years prior to the signing of the last will, the lawyer had received instructions for never a completed will in 1998. The propriety of such disclosure by the lawyer is a matter for another day, its admissibility and relevance are far from clear. The evidence is that two and one half years prior, the executor had instructed a different lawyer to prepare a will for trial. This lawyer had been instructed to draw the different will for personal reasons and had been in the process of drawing it for months. His yielding to that pressure was consistent with family solidarity and could not be construed as undue influence. Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which, if accepted at trial, would tend to negate testamentarian capacity.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the motion."

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","This was an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the respondent had abused a child as described in s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. The applicant had known the respondent for a considerable period and had stayed over at his house alone with him. The parties had sexual contact as young as eleven or twelve years old and included fooling around with the dog's penis, which he tried to get in her bum, but failed, because he had his shirt unbuttoned and pants down to his knees. The alleged anal intercourse was so painful that the dog had to be put down. The mother testified that she had to perform anal surgery because the dog grabbed her crotch. The court found that the evidence of the child that she was sexually assaulted had more probability of truth than disbelief. The accused was convicted of sexual assault, but acquitted of criminal fraud."

HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The court found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the SGI policy. The respondents were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1) The trial judge erred in determining SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage which it had extended to the homeowners. It is clear that TWC and SGI are intermediaries within the meaning of the term'intermediary'. Whether SGI is liable to indemnify the respondents or contribute to the amount payable to the Homeowner through the Contributory Negligence Act is a question for the court. 2) SGI as an insurer, as well as its employees, are at liberty to place insurance for their customers with insurers other than SGI. This is not a case where SGI breached its duty of care to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) by failing to provide coverage to them as instructed. SGI, as an insurance broker, is responsible for providing coverage to its clients. 3) There are a number of issues on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. In this case, the trial judge found that the defendants and third party each contributed (50%/50%) by their negligent acts, to the loss sustained by the Draders. The defendants plead against the third party in contributory negligence. The trial court concluded SGI may have been negligent or in breach of contract in respect of the McCallum Hill policy but with due and proper diligence he could have found that out by simply examining their previous policy.  4) It is evident from comparing the insurance policies and the coverage applied for by the defendants that they and third parties, together, formed a'manual narrative' for the coverage provided by SGI to the respondents. The defendant was not aware of the special coverage available for accidental breakage and damage to the Swarovski collection. The plaintiff and defendant were not talking at cross purposes and that would no doubt have prompted him to ensure that the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the respondents would have very specifically referred to the special scope of coverage being applied for. His actions constituted negligence at law.  5) There is no general duty on the insurer. The evidence clearly showed that the defendant and the parties did not discuss the nature or extent of SGI coverage"

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order.

The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: The issue is whether the children are to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. The parties commenced common law relationship in 2000. There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the mother in La Ronge but with the petitioner having access on weekends. The evidence discloses that the respondent sold her home and business in March 2013. The petitioner says that in April 2013, the respondent asked the children if they were planning to move out of the district. He was advised by the respondent on April 1, 2013 that she would not be receiving the children for their scheduled parenting week because she had relocated to Melville.

4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, inter alia, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. The parties had primarily resided with the respondent for the past four and a half years. There had been a variety of applications to the court, court orders and unsuccessful pre-trial settlement conferences. The respondent has not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order nor has she had the opportunity to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was not an attempt to overturn the interim parenting arrangements made for the children by the respondent. It was an application for an order reversing the respondent's interim parenting order. The order that the children should be in their lawful custody except for the times set out in the application, and that the court must first determine that the petitioner shall have the sole interim decision making authority with respect to the children. In the short term, on an interim basis, the order will remain in effect. The Court will respond to the purpose, intent and substance of the petitioner's application."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was approached by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation escalated to the point where the accused threw the knife at the complainant, who ran towards the vehicle. The complainant chased after the accused and slashed the vehicle's tire, but the accused ran after the complainant and chased after him, while holding the knife in his hand. At trial, the Crown argued that self-defence was not applicable in all of the circumstances and that this defence did not succeed. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged. The evidence established that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the respondent and the words used by the respondent were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action taken by the defendant against the complainant. The Court had concluded that the accused who initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, getting into his personal space, was completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the complainant may have perceived was made or presented by Mr. Brown in the circumstances of this case."

5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after it was found that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds. The corporate defendant solicitor had previously advised the plaintiff that he was unable to attend because the examinations were not properly scheduled in accordance with the Rules. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the appointments were made. Late in the proceedings, the plaintiff's solicitor received a call from the defendant's solicitor claiming that the applicant was not an officer or director of the company and that he would have to seek instructions as to the proper officer to be examined. This failure by the applicant's solicitor to set out dates for the examinations was therefore grounds for strike. HELD: 1)The non-attendances of the defendants did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence. On the basis of their conduct throughout the proceedings the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants filed defences to the actions. The current applications before the Court clearly indicate that the defendants or the corporation have little or no regard for the administration of justice. The defendants have abused the discretion of the court to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. 2)The defendants were expected to promptly file their defences and to proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it is eventually determined. Regrettably the defendants' counsel has not maintained the level of courtesy and professionalism that is expected of a member of the legal profession."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him. HELD: 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The only issue for determination was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim statements would impede the accused's ability to make full answer and defence. 2)The respondent's failure to provide copies of all the documents in its file to the defence was contrary to the principles enunciated in Thomsen v. R., which held that disclosure in criminal proceedings is now constitutionally required by s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d) in the Charter, though not formally imposed by the court. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of this case. It is clear that this case is different in that the accused contends that his rights pursuant to s7, 11, s8(a), s7 and s11(d)) are violated. 3)The court was of the view that disclosure by defence counsel in these circumstances was inconsistent with the right to disclosure which flows from the constitutional guarantee of fair trial. 4)Mitigating circumstances in this case included the absence of evidence or evidence that could be obtained by way of discovery, inquiry, disclosure or plea discussions. 5)Counsel for the accused was restricted by the order of the court to enter into an undertaking which provided that he would not make copies of any videotape of interviews with the complainant or watch it except with his counsel or an expert witness retained on his behalf.

The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer. The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief. In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje be appointed as selling officer. HELD: 1)It was not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as a selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? [2] The matter was of sufficient importance that it should reduce my thoughts to fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act. The discretion granted to the Court does not extend to endorsing a document as testamentary which does not comply with any of the formal requirements of the Act as to execution, and, in particular, a document which does not bear the signature of the deceased.","The applicants applied for an order setting aside the grant of Letters of Administration and granting Letters Probate with respect to a document purporting to be the last will and testament of the deceased.

5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent, on the basis that the respondent's income was significantly higher than the child's expected annual income. On the same basis, she also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. Variation of On-going Support for Kimberly [ edit ]The parties agreed that much of their income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. The respondent argued that these amounts should not be considered as part of his income for child support purposes. HELD: 1) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952, the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. It is reasonable to impute additional income to the respondent for 2002 given the pattern of income for the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he still retains significant assets. This is not a reason to exclude capital assets from the calculation of child support for 2002. 2) The respondent has only been required to include one-half of her income in excess of $150,000 in all other years that his income exceeded that threshold amount. 3) The Court has discretion as to whether the Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support payable without interruption to June 30, 2003."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had taken parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling, and had placed the children in different adoptive homes because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency and that they had supported the applicants' aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the evidence presented by the applicants was not sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order for the permanent care. The children were placed in one home for adoption, with ongoing, informal contact between the parents. The parents' parenting was abysmal and they did not demonstrate the ability to provide the children with the stability and consistency required to succeed at parenting. It was unlikely that the children would benefit from the Agency's services if they were returned to them. The father had completed anger management training and the mother had completed marriage counselling. Although other parenting services were available through Family Services, none had been successful in the areas of mental health, anger management and impulse control."
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","HELD: The accused was released from detention after a show cause hearing. There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. His conditions included that he not consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs, and that he would not enter any public premise which served alcoholic beverages or drugs. He was using an alias at the time of his arrest and was facing outstanding charges in Manitoba, and drug related charges in Alberta. He had not been ordered released. As a result of the foregoing, a review of the detention orders by the judge and her Honour Judge found that they would ordinarily be cursory in their cursory examination, but this delay causes the court a concern. The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. HELD: 1) The accused is released on a recognizance. There will be an order releasing him upon entering into a deal. 2) He shall not change his residence in Regina and not change that residence between the hours of 10:00 pm and 7:00 a.m. the following day and shall present himself to any peace officer checking a curfew. The defence has been unable to accommodate the accused's continued detention and there is a concern that the trial of these accused will take place within a year of the date when the accused was arrested. There has been a concern for the best interests of the accused that they will be subject to a delay of at least 6 months from the date they were arrested to the next trial date. It is unlikely, even from the most optimistic view point, that the defence will be successful at this stage of the trial. The Court of Appeal has attributed the delay to a variety of factors, including the inability to accommodate various defence applications for release."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","An appeal from a decision by an adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The adjudicator determined that there was a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, that was not conferred 'officiously' and was not an unenforceable contract. The plaintiff, who had been unaware that the work had been performed, was not paid for the flooring. The defendant, who dealt with the appellant company, Maritime, contracted for a certain amount of flooring material from the Appellant (Wacky's). There was no direct contact between the appellant and the defendant, and the purchasing of all the material was left to the defendant's flooring manager. During the construction process, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by Jollymore or Maritime and Joseph did not receive satisfactory explanation from Jollymore as to where the money went. Eventually, the work was performed and the defendants met the terms of the contract. Wacky was awarded the amount of $18,601.55 plus interest at 5% per annum. Order accordingly. In almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, there was an essential nexus between the words and conduct of the defendant and the plaintiffs conferring of the benefit. The same is not true in the case of Joseph, who was unaware of the work being performed and had in fact selected the materials for his home. He was awarded costs."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused had been in a relationship with a woman who was a drug addict and had recently smoked marijuana. The two had a brief conversation and the accused admitted smoking marijuana in front of a mall before returning to the courthouse. The police approached the accused and noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the inside of the vehicle. They asked the accused where he had been and he told them that he dropped a roach at a mall. The officer noted that the accused appeared tired, was very quiet and had not been given any order or direction not to leave. They conducted a search of the accused's vehicle and found no marijuana. They arrested the accused for possession of marijuana. At issue was whether the officer's reasonable grounds to arrest the accused were based upon reasonable and probable grounds. HELD: The accused was arrested and charged with marijuana possession and possession without a warrant. 1) The accused's statement to the police was found to be free and voluntary. There was no breach of his rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter.  2) Although there was no police caution prior to the arrest, the officer had to show something beyond those rather unremarkable abilities. 3) There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was not under arrest at the time it was conducted, he was not physically restrained and his statement was not found to constitute a violation of rights. 4) Although the argument regarding the legality of the arresting officer's action was in terms of reasonable grounds, the argument that it was based on the smell of burned marijuana alone was not supported by all of the facts known to the officer. There were no police concerns during the search.  5) The Court of Appeal was bound by the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeals and the interpretation of the Biron decision."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to comply with two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and he fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was given a global fine of $2,000, which he was fined in the amount of $8,050. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the Court was required to take into account the defendant's own actions, which contributed to the hazard of the defendant working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. The Court was also required to consider the moral blameworthiness of this defendant, as he failed to take every reasonable precaution to avoid the contraventions of the Act."

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.

6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included making sales contacts, co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system for the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in her employment contract. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The jury found that the respondent was entitled to six months' notice. 2)It found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The trial judge correctly identified two grounds for awarding damages for mental distress: the jury should not have permitted the issue of mental distress to go to the jury and he mischarged the jury on the question of foreseeability. The issue in assessing damages was not whether the plaintiff got what he bargained for, but rather for the damage caused by the conduct of the respondent."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At issue was whether equal latitude may be required in the defendant's cross-exam of the witnesses. HELD: 1)The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. The defendant was entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but acts of the employer which constitute constructive dismissal entitle the employee to withdraw her services without reduction of the time of notice. 2)Saskatchewan s. 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23. 3)The plaintiff remains entitled to pay for any medical expenses which fell against her usual net worth of $20,000. In addition to the medical expenses, she was to receive punitive damages for any bad feelings she had suffered during the employment period. 4)The defendant is to deduct the amount owing by plaintiff to the defendant after deducting the cost which is fixed at $50 of qualifying for such employment. If the parties do not agree on the amount thereof, the matter may be referred to the Court, if necessary, by application for further directions."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was Constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded his holiday pay in lieu of time off. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of the LSA and concluded that the defendant had not suffered prejudice to the plaintiff's right to holiday pay. 1)The plaintiff was hired by the defendant in 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park. He was hired as superintendent in 1989. He worked 30 hours per week. In 1990, he was paid $8.00 per hour. He claimed the holiday pay should not be included in the calculation of holiday pay as it was a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. 2)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. Even if the plaintiff is entitled to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years, he should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 3)In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He also asserted that holiday pay was really wage, as he was a'manager' within the meaning of s.4(2) of the holidays. 4)Any holiday pay owing to the defendant will be calculated only on the table. The onus to rebut the presumption arising out of a requirement in the Labour Standards Act to meet his burden to establish his damage is squarely on the plaintiff. In this case it would be contrary to public policy for the plaintiff to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. In the alternative he would be substantially prejudiced if he was now allowed to assert that right."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. as he was driving 70 km per hour in 40 km zone. Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment at 2:12 am, the officer noted a distinct smell of liquor coming from the accused. At 2:42 a roadside screening test was performed and the accused failed the roadside test. As result the officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample, alleging that the solution was not'suitable'. The accused did not provide a valid reason for his request and argued that the failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution constituted a violation of his right to counsel. HELD: The accused's application for a stay of proceedings and costs were dismissed. 1) The accused has not proven his rights to a Charter right to freedom of expression or the right to due process. There is no reasonable reason for this failure to produce a breathalyzer solution. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The defence has made an effort to demonstrate its right to be heard. 2) There has been no breach of the accused's Charter rights by the Court of Appeal. 3) The request for production of ampoules representative of those used in analyzing the breath samples was not made lightly. There were several reasons for the failure, but none sufficient to justify the production of them. 4) There was insufficient viva voce evidence to support the defence's demand for production. It is only by having access to the accused that an accused can be assured an opportunity to make full answer and defence."

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father had previously been seeking sole custody of the children. The mother had based her parenting arrangements around the idea that one child would be placed in primary care and custody, while the father wanted to retain a child psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist to help him adjust to the new environment. Both parents were capable of caring for the children, but the current situation had created stress and anxiety for both parents. The children's best interests were found to be best served by a shared parenting arrangement where one parent was to be retained and the other one was to have the right to approve the child psychiatrist or therapist."

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the application that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar it ought not retroactively reinstate the caveat because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000. The respondents were entitled to costs fixed at $750. 1) Even if a mistake was made, as a result of the principle of 'defeasibility' a caveat was properly removed from the title as part of the notice to lapse procedure. Although the legislation that introduced the new land titles system contains transitional provisions that stipulate that any process started under the old Act is to be completed under the new Act, as far as practicable, it was not practicable in this case. Therefore, the court found that retroactive reinstatement was not a necessary first step in accessing the assurance fund.  2) The principle was not materially altered by the passage of the land titles act, 2000 nor was it expressly incorporated into the new legislation in Part III entitled 'Fundamental Principles'. It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance funds through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief.

7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants had solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The husband was granted privileged communications with and with the accountant. The wife and two adult sons were granted privileges against the accountant for providing such communications. The accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the applicants was clearly as a representative of the client's solicitor and not merely as a liaison between the parties. HELD: The question is not whether the accounting firm has solicitor privilege but whether it has privileged communications between the husband's accountant and the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The central issue is whether and to what extent solicitor and client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the parties' communications. Here, the accountant was acting as representative for the client, while the accountants were receiving legal advice from the applicants. Counsel for the respondent in the Bankruptcy case abandoned its claim for privilege in regard to the documents he had forwarded to the accountant, other than ones for which solicitor privilege is claimed, to the contents of some of the documents which were not prepared by the accountant but were sent to the applicant's solicitor for production."

The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway crews or highway equipment when he was travelling faster then 60 kilometres per hour. HELD: The accused is found not guilty. The Court found that the offence under s.203(1), of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and that its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only issue that the Court asked for an order requiring the defence to attend for cross-examination was whether the accused did so. The defence had included a photograph of the offending vehicle taken by a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken and the speed of it when it was taken, which in this case was 84 kms/hr. There were four affidavits confirming service of the Summary Offences Notice, its photograph, Mr. Christensen's affidavit and SGI's certified search."
7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as claimed in the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax. The defendant cementing and reservoir stimulation service contractors paid $393,289.73 (the PST) on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s.50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, is entitled to payment of PST from the third party contractors in undetermined amounts on the materials supplied to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the Saskatchewan Government's claim against the plaintiff for refund of the PST is barred by s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act and s.56 of the Pension and Health Tax Act. The claims against the defendant are without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the defendant contractors and Husky. The third party contractor denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim, that it is one of the cementing service contractors referred to in general terms and in more particular terms in the Defendant's Reply to the Demand for Particulars dated May 9, 2003 and the Minister's statement of defence dated September 9, 2002. HELD: Even if the Government was entitled to refund of PST the plaintiff is not liable under the Act to pay it, the parties properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible property. 1)Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST, the 3rd party contractors responsible for the provision of cement and fracturing fluid to Husky were responsible to collect and remit the PST for the purposes of the legislation. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to refunds of the sales tax it paid to the defendant during the claim period. 3)The defendants were not responsible to pay PST on materials they consumed in performance of their contracts with Husky but were liable to remit it to the Government for refund. 4)Sanjel, Trican and BJ Services did not raise three defences. Sanjel admitted the allegations of fact contained in paragraph 5 and that other documents outside the contracts set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the plaintiff and the Contractors in entering into the contracts. As such, their claims against them were without merit. 5)The court found that the claim against Husky is statute-barred."

He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident. Throughout this period, the plaintiff missed only three days and then three weeks of work. The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate. The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain. The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident when his car was struck by the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff had worked as a technician for several years and claimed damages for personal injuries. The defendant claimed general damages of $25,000. Both parties agreed that the plaintiff was responsible for undue delay in bringing this case to trial. Awarding the plaintiff full-time damages, that the pain was caused primarily by the accident, and not a physical result of the accident. Although the accident had caused some pain in his hip, it did not result in a permanent disability. The pain was mild to moderate, and was not consistent with the injuries suffered in the 1988 accident."
8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. A hearing was held before the same deputy rentalsman who conducted the hearing on the first complaint. The Deputy rentalsman made two contradictory statements. He said the landlord was justified in serving a notice to terminate the tenancy but that the differences between the landlord and tenants did not arisesolely from the tenants' reasonable complaints. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman was restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel the decision was restored as held to be reasonable complaints by the tenants. Some deference must be shown to those aspects of the deputy rentals' decisions which reflect an exercise ofretion."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The accused, a 23 year old aboriginal, pled guilty to two counts of robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code: he was sentenced to 9 months time served, plus 2 years less 1 day conditional, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, plus two years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was set aside and a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each count concurrently was imposed. 1)The accused was 23 years old aboriginal with a prior record consisting of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. He has violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times. He had grade 3 education and did not have significant employment history. In his pre-sentence report he was considered high risk to reoffend. 2)The Court of Appeal did not rely on the principles expressed in Severight v. Daniels. Rather, it relied on the principle of deterrence and not on the penitentiary term imposed."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellants appealed the trial judge's decision to award relief under s. 57 of The Queen's Bench Act, for failing to consider whether the joint bank and investment accounts subject to the provisions of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to the appellant for the benefit of his sister and grandchildren. The residuary beneficiaries brought an action against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and sought a judgment to that effect as well as a judgment for the appellant's contributions to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge did not err in law in finding that the appellant intended the funds to go to the beneficiaries. Rather, he reviewed the evidence and found as fact that the respondent intended to give the money to him as a gift, not a gift to herself.  2) The evidence of the beneficiary, the appellant, was conflicting. The evidence as to the intended beneficiaries was that they intended to treat their three children equally. 3) The respondent did not intend to make any gifts to the applicant. The appellant could not collaterally claim the funds for himself. 4) The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. It is trite law that a judge can accept part of an evidence of fact and reject another part. It was not the case here that the judge erred in law by not considering the effect of s. 75 of the Trustee Act, which gives the benefit to the granddaughters of the deceased, rather than to the appellants."

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked to be discharged from bankruptcy. She argued that the horses were her personal property and that they should be kept in compensation for expenses incurred while she was in bankruptcy. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. She paid surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period and another $300 for horses. She also requested bank statements for 12 months prior to bankruptcy. 1)It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. 2)The respondent first bought the horses as pets for her children. They became part of her household in 2003 when she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder, and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. 3)She had little time to make arrangements. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. She was required to deal with immediately finding a new home for her family. 4)There were a number of issues that should have been addressed in the discharge order. The respondent's evidence at the hearing was that she did not provide the Trustee with the VIN number on the 2007 Cobalt vehicle and with the information required to complete the income tax returns. The Trustee was not asked to determine the value of the three horses. The applicant indicated that the horse trailer was valued at $400 and that she paid $500 for rent. 5)There was no evidence before the court as to how much surplus income the respondent should have in common with the horses. It was important that the respondent be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible because there was no longer any equity in the home which would justify her paying a lesser amount for the horses than she should have paid for them."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with an expedited arbitration before an arbitrator appointed by the court. HELD: The motions to strike are dismissed. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which in accordance with the CSBA were beyond the court's jurisdiction. It is not adequately framed in the pleadings and in the evidence before the court to meet the applicable test.  1) It is unfortunate that the timeline for retroactive payments did not adequately frame the issue and to fail to do so the plaintiffs have failed to adequately consider the implications for the employees of having to make payments at any particular time in the coming calendar year. If the case cannot be resolved on the foregoing criteria, must resort to an assessment of the balance of convenience. 2) There may be irreparable harm for some employees, an example of which was provided to the plaintiffs in the oral evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs. The defendants have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. 3) The plaintiffs have presented evidence to the contrary but it is obvious they are quite unable from their perspective to assess the degree to which mandatory chronological relief will be beyond the Court's ability to comply with and fulfil. 4) Historically the law was abundantly clear that the courts could not grant an Interlocutory mandatory injunction in the absence of a claim for substantive relief. The courts were not able to decide the issue in the manner that was proposed by the plaintiffs and did not believe that such an undertaking would have been required. They were unable to quantify the monetary value to some of the 2011 retirees of imposing practical limits on their choices of when they would retire. 5) It would be unfortunate if the court were to encroach on the arbitration process in the way that the plaintiffs contended otherwise.  6) It was not appropriate for the court in any event to issue an order imposing a specific deadline for the defendants.

8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was subject to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of breach of his rights under the Charter. The primary defence was that the police officer detained the accused for the investigation of a possible hit and run. The defence argued that the detention was not arbitrary, the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused as she was sure the vehicle was his. However, when the police were able to confirm that the accused's vehicle had been operated, they arrested him, informed him of the reason for the arrest and gave him his rights and warnings as well as the Intoxilyzer demand. The accused was found not guilty of both charges because the police conducted an unreasonable search and seizure without informing the accused, who did not see the vehicle, that was being operated, and because the fob and keys were not in his pocket. HELD: The defence was excluded from the evidence of what followed pursuant to s.24(2). The search of the accused and the retrieval of evidence from his pocket was a breach of the Accused's right to be free from an unreasonable and seizure. The police officer most likely did not advise the accused of his right to contact counsel. The exclusion of that evidence of the keys and fob further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the operator of the motor vehicle. As a result, the accused is not guilty on both charges.  1)The defence did not provide the usual defence of 'investigative detention', it relied upon the complainant’s evidence that the defendant had driven into her vehicle and then sped off. 2)There was no evidence of where the accused was located or how long he was there. 3)There were no searchable grounds to exclude the evidence. The search, seizure and search for evidence were numerous and point to ignorance on the part of the police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and investigative detention. The Court allowed the search of an individual when they were detained for investigative purposes and when detained for further investigation, but an officer who detains for the investigative purposes must inform the accused if he removed the handcuffs or not, without delay."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny reimbursement for medical marijuana is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. The Board's decision was based on the evidence before it rather than relying on a misconceived perception of the potential political ramification of paying for medical marihuana. There is no evidence the Board made its decision on the basis of irrelevant considerations. The board applied a standard of review that was reasonable and deference was given to it."
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting portions of the University of Saskatchewan Act and the Act, particularly Section 51. 2. The Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation, including the context and purpose of the legislation, the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature, the contextual approach and the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result. Both parties relied on dicta from Dunsmuir in support of their submissions. HELD: 1)An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor the collective agreement. The right to grieve a decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board reversed a decision of one of the committees. The review decision left open whether the Board was bound by the president's recommendation or by the Agreement. 2)The Arbitrator found after reviewing the Saskatchewan Act, 1995 and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the President in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  3)The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents. 4)Both parties relied upon dicta.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, questioned the validity of it, and claimed his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Crown could adduce evidence at a hearing to establish the recency of the ITO, and that evidence from the amplification hearing would be sufficient to support the Crown's argument that a search of a computer or a phone without a warrant was a reasonable and probable grounds to do so.  1)None of the accused's testimony in the original ITO was admissible in respect of whether his Charter rights were violated. The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors made by the investigators, but which were done in good faith and not with an intent to either deceive or mislead. 2)There was no evidence at the hearing that identified any errors or omissions by the accused. It was plain that the accused was using a third party to gather information for his purposes. The ITO alone did not constitute sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was being in a position of trust or authority toward a person aged 16 years for a sexual purpose, touch, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body, or the anal region of a person under the age of 18 for the purposes of which the warrant was issued. The suggested criminal offence of possession of child pornography was not contained in the ITo.  3)The court distinguished between the two types of evidence used in a warrant application: amplification evidence which was adduced prior to the issuance of the warrant, and information which was not. The limited scope of amplification evidence (AMPLification) was used to correct minor, technical errors (e.g. the search of pictures, internet history or other material that was not placed before the issuing justice prior to completing his forensic examination. The practice in 2013 was not necessarily to review the warrant. That practice has since changed. 4)The accused was charged with two counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to ss. 153(1)(a) and one count of sexual organs and a charge under s. 163.1(4) for sexual offences contrary to the Charter."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and instead filed a requisition with the clerk of the county under s.7(1) of the Act. Granting the applicant costs, that the applicant is entitled to continue the ditch to a proper outlet, and to have its fees paid by the municipality to the applicant."
9_1996canlii8701.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs. He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system. What the appellant did was distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area designated as Hacker's Delight available only to persons granted special status and were not where any caller would become aware of them without J.PM's permission. It was clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner by which the users accessed their computer, and providing the software to assist in the downloading by those users, the appellant was also distributing."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, and with driving over.08, contraryto s.253(c) and s.255(a). The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. The officer also noted that the accused's eyes were glassy and glassy, and he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. HELD: In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence is not sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused is not guilty. 1)In the circumstances herein, the accused was awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist and brought him to the police vehicle. However, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps the accused had been overtired rather than being impaired by alcohol. Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. The nature and quality of the impairment evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the court with a doubt as to impairment. Therefore the accused does not have reasonable and probable grounds for making a breath demand.  2)In all criminal cases, the trial judge must be satisfied as to the accused\'s guilt beyond reasonable doubt before conviction can be registered. Accordingly, before convicting an accused of driving, the court must be sure that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by Alcohol or drug. If the evidence does not leave the police officer with a reasonable question as to whether the accused has impeded his or her ability to give breath samples (aside from the fact that the officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights and then went to check on him when the lights turned green at 2:56 a.m. and 3:17 a..m.). In either event, the peace officer is vested with very important responsibility which is intended to ensure that members of the public are not subjected to a breath sample demand, and all of the serious consequences that may flow from that breach should be excluded. 3)In this case, the officer did not regard the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that he was immediately awakened by the officer grabbing him by his wrist and then thereafter, he looked to"

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff obtained a twenty-five year lease for 22,000 square feet that became a supermarket. The landlord promised to restrict competition by other tenants. The receiver applied for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a permanent injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer harm not compensable in damages if their claim was right and if interim relief was not given, and that the balance of convenience was with the landlord not the tenant. HELD: The application for an injunction was dismissed. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the Sobeys lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms as amended. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the lease. Such evidence would be admissible to prove some of the external context, context always being relevant to the interpretation of those terms. However, there was no evidence of a mistake in the expression of the terms or the lease amendments which would suggest there was a substantial breach of the covenant. The facts did not suggest there would be a need for a final determination of the issues or the cause of action."

The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for the Attorney General to discharge under s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act. HELD: The motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General was granted and the hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004.  1)The accused was entitled to disclosure of all the evidence in his custody or control except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There had been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The application for detailed disclosure prior to an extradition hearing was dismissed.  3)The role of the hearing judge was modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of a extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case. The extradition procedure is based upon a treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has a fair and just criminal system. The applicant is entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that a fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. That argument has not been advanced, nor is it expedient at this stage."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabited with one another continuously for two years. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant, who acquired the Vancouver property in October 1994, acquired it after the commencement of spousal relationship, rather than before, is best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of the Family property Act, and the distribution made by the trial court.  2) This reduces to a finding of fact, and in my judgment it is sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 121 SaskR. 17 (Sask. C.A.). It found that Dewar's position regarding the loans he obtained from his parents to purchase the house in Regina came to rest on these provisions of s. 23. III. 4) The evidence showed that the value of the Regina house fell to be taken into account as though the house constituted the'matrimonial home', or the 'family home', rather than the $100,000 loans. 5) The appellant appealed."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education. 2) It is the view that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was fundamentally unfit, taking into account both the seriousness and the respondent's prior criminal record and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act. There was no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor to be taken into account. The principles of general deterrence and deterrence were not to be considered as a separate factor in the sentencing decision. The trial judge was of the opinion that the SCC decision in B.W.P. had fundamentally changed the sentencing rules in a cases governed by the youth criminal justice act. The sentencing judge erred in concluding that a custodial sentence would not be open to this young person in a non-custodial setting. The sentence was set aside and, after granting four months credit for his time in pre-sentence custody, this Court imposed a sentence of 14 months closed custody to be followed by 7 months community supervision. There is no suggestion that deterrence is factor taken into consideration."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant sought an order removing the executor of the estate pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act. The applicant was a niece of the testator and was designated as the alternate executor. The deceased had difficulties with vision and hearing and appeared to have difficulty comprehending and responding coherently to the questions asked on discovery. She claimed that her niece was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate. The executor had no clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor and appeared unable to instruct counsel in the circumstances. The niece argued that there was no basis upon which to remove the present executor, given his disability and mental health. She alleged that he had passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship of a third party, to whom John Conrod, a trustee, had been appointed. HELD: 1)The application was dismissed.  1)Costs should be in the cause. However, in this instance it was appropriate to fix costs. 2)There was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the deceased was not competent to administer the Estate. It was established on the basis of the evidence that he suffered from severe hearing loss and was unable to perform his duties under the current circumstances. There was contrary evidence submitted by the estate in the affidavits of Ms. Lynds and Mr. Conrod that counsel prepared the affidavit. These comments were limited to the applicant’s duty to instruct. 3)The applicant was 99 years old and had difficulty with vision, hearing and hearing. He had difficulty communicating with others. His wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to her bank shares. She therefore did not have full understanding of how they were dealt with.  4)Although the applicant had significant hearing loss, she was able to instruct her husband to assist her in looking after his estate. She was also entitled to a share of the Royal Bank shares held in her name. 5)The executor himself was at a risk of death if he did not learn how to administer and protect the estate and he was only entitled to one share per annum.  6)The deceased was the sole residuary beneficiary and the application to remove an executor can be made by any person."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: The applicant Contracting Ltd. applied for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 requiring the respondents to deliver four pieces of equipment. The respondents had not registered any security interest in the equipment until October 2009. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the equipment was no longer available because of 101138096's election. The respondent perfected its security interest on the equipment by taking possession of it and transferred title to it to the respondent free and clear of the claim of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents and the registration under the Act made by Inland as registration number 300516894 was discharged. 1)The security interest was perfected when it attached and all steps required for perfection pursuant to the Act had been completed, regardless of the order of occurrence. 2)The registration and search criteria were set out in Royal Bank of Canada v. Steinhubl's Masonry Ltd. v. Crown Asset Ltd. (RBC) in respect to serial numbers. Section 35(4) should be read along with s. 30(6) and (7) with the collateral description provisions of the regulations. These provisions create a special scheme for the description of specific goods by serial numbers on financing statements. This scheme is designed to maximize the protection available through serial number registration without forcing secured parties to undertake unnecessary registration requirements. The Act and regulations provide that all goods may be classified as consumer goods, inventory or equipment. Goods defined by the regulations as'serial numbered goods' held as consumer Goods must be described specifically by serial number. The definition of'serial numbers' is limited to certain defined types of goods which have unique, easily identifiable serial numbers (such as motor vehicles). These types of products have unique features that have unique properties. Different consequences are associated with the decision to describe serial numbered equipment in the general collateral description field. The choice of one method of registration over the other is not without consequence. If the secured party chooses to describe the equipment in general terms in the appropriate field on the financing statement, the maximum level of protection against competing interests is obtained. The security interest will have priority over the interest of subsequent buyer of the goods who acquired the equipment for value and without knowledge of the security interest. He will not have priority only with creditors and the trustee in bankruptcy of the debtor and will not be priority over other perfected security interests in the Equipment.  3)In the circumstances, ownership transferred from the respondent to the applicant"

He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.

Taking judicial notice of the fact that the University has a limited number of placements within its College of medicine and that the training of a physician is lengthy and expensive process vis-à-vis the University, it is obvious that the applicant has exhausted his opportunity to present his case. The appeal board was not empowered to determine the merits of the appeal. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Board of Directors has such a power. In fact, if the power existed in the College Board it would be limited to a vetting step and of course no need for the establishment of an appeal board. There is a limit on the Board's jurisdiction to determine whether an appeal will be heard and its decision is therefore quashed. 3) It is not appropriate however for the Board to usurp the function of the Board and review the material to determine if the applicant's appeal falls within para.1(a) of Part VI of the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The matter is returned to the Bylaw Committee for a decision according to law that is not reasonable or necessary to this student's appeal."
9_2012skqb99.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process. HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that National is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. HELD: 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases. 2) National has not raised any reasonable defence. There was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions without having to meet the more stringent requirements for injunctive relief. 3) In this case, National has pled equitable set-off. The Court accepted that such pleading can serve to delay, but not defeat, FCC's foreclosure actions. 4) In the present circumstances the present defendant is acting in contravention of representations to National that FCC would act in commercially reasonable manner in the enforcement of its security, which representations National has acted upon to its detriment, the FCC action is barred during the respective 3-year period of barn- use restriction. 5) Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff."

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"The accused was found guilty, by jury, of breaking and entering the complainant’s home and committing therein the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The jury did not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction; the sentencing judge was required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence. The accused had 67 previous convictions, most of which related to thefts and break and enters. He had also been a parole violator and was re-committed in 2005. The complainant had undertaken two bible studies courses while on remand and had had no institutional infractions while on the remand. HELD: The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration, three years of which were served because of parole. The court found that the accused had an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. Most of the convictions relate to thefts. The Crown found that both the accused and the complainant were principal and/or party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The Court found that in the circumstances the accused was convicted as charged as charged and participated as principal or party in the aggravated assault."

b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2, s.3(c) and s.4(d) of the Charter.

The accused were accompanied by a number of other persons. 2)The Court was not faced with a reverse onus under s.303 of the Code as the purpose of the legislation was to protect the privacy and reputations of individuals. 3)The impugned legislative provision had an objective of pressing and substantial concern in free and democratic society. The Court must balance the value of freedom of expression against the reputation of all persons. 4)The principles of fairness, equity and justice were at issue. 5)To warrant prosecution the accused must be sufficiently serious to require the intervention of the Crown in the public interest. 6)S.300 is a reasonable limit prescribed by law which is in violation of s.11(c). 7)The test of proportionality was set out in R. v.

Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.

HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.

There remains for determination the quantum of maintenance for the children, the issue of spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The parties were in agreement that the amount of maintenance should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines. Given the relative income of the parties and current income tax implications, it was reasonable and fair for Mary to receive her share of the pension plan while she was with the parties. 2)The termination and retirement method were the route to go in this case. The respondent acknowledged his obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the two children. However, he did not intend to pursue his claim for equalization of household goods. 3)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child per month for support of the three children, divided equally between them when and if anything wasrealized on the shares.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. He arranged to hire an individual he knew who was hired to do the backhoe work on the excavation to use as his backhoe man to help lay pipe for the workers at the site. This person had no experience in the construction industry but had completed the job as a pipe-layer. He had no knowledge of the Act and regulations in force under the authority of the defendant but had been trained and supervised by the defendant. In his role as supervisor the defendant had a duty to supervise and oversee the excavation work and to ensure that the usual protocols for job safety were met. The Act does not define 'due diligence' but well established case authority simply defines this as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.

The accused advanced a spirited argument that the evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. He attacked the evidence of the ambulance attendants and police officer who were on their way back to Spiritwood when they noted the vehicle parked in an unusual place. HELD: The accused was found guilty of count two of the Information. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. Counsel for the accused had first considered whether the accused was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle under s. 258(1).

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. He was attending to clear lumber at the defendant's premises and when he entered the premises, he did not see anything located on the side of the desk or any obstruction by the glass doors. He proceeded to the lumber yard where he parked his vehicle and then returned to the premises where he picked up lumber and other materials. He parked his car at the defendants' warehouse and then drove to the defendants', stopping at the rear of the building to pick up lumber. When he returned, he noticed a large dent in the wall which he thought was part of the obstruction. He examined the evidence and concluded the sum of $1,000.00 was more than reasonable in the circumstances. Awarding the plaintiff $8,500.00 by way of general damages, that the defendant had not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and that the plaintiff failed to use reasonable care for his own safety. Recognizing that not even the exigencies of Western Canadian winter conditions would make usual the presence on the floor of a large bank in a city of 30,000, in mid-afternoon, of a dangerous glaze of water underfoot near the tellers' wickets, no amount was awarded."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: 1) The trial judge was convinced that the present lease was in the public domain and could not be the subject of a breach of trust.  2) It was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained, that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule (see Anger and Honsberger Real Property). The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3) In deciding whether there has been a breach, the crucial determination is the timeof vesting. The phrase 'farmout agreement' is equivalent to a way of describing the reversionary interest in the minerals and the fact that the parties reached an agreement in principle. The only matter to be resolved was for the parties to satisfy themselves that Tarragon had good title. The parties were still using terminology which spoke to contingency and futurity.

The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English versions of the Act. The provision excluding causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his/her spouse or any other person may be asserted for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. It excluded damages for loss of expectation of life as required by the SF Act. In the alternative, the appellants applied to the Chambers judge, who held that if a person was killed as a result of another's negligence, the estate was entitled to claim for damages for that loss. For the purposes of this appeal, the Legislature had denied such a claim but provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action pursuant to the Fatal Injuries Act."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. The defendant argued that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen’s Bench Act, 1998.

However, this judgment shall not be entered into until the said $15,000 has been paid to my lawyer. 3)The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms.

b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the only viable options were to permit the petitioner to relocate the primary residence of the child and to allow him to have more access to his biological father and sister. The child had been living with his maternal grandmother in the Kindersley district and would be separated from his psychological parent when he moved to the Archerwill district. The petitioner was entitled to retain the child's primary residence only by returning to the Kinderley district. There were negative consequences in changing the child’s primary residence which included the disruption to his school, friends, school activities and certainty. The move must be considered in light of the circumstances prior to the relocation."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","An appeal under s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006. The appellant asserted a palpable and overriding error by the trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount also owing to the appellant by the respondent. The respondent argued that there was no error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact by the judge, and that his conclusions are not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the judgment. The trial judge was an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact. The court of appeal must extend very substantial deference to that of a trial judge. 2)The trial judge accepted most of the evidence including its evidence as it related to an implied admission by the the respondent of some existing indebtedness owing to him. Nor did he expressly reject her testimony as to the amount, $1,900. However, there was other testimony, contradictory, before the court on that point that showed the respondent unequivocally denied any loan made to him by his appellant. 3)The appellant was not persuaded that the judgment was not reasonably supported by the evidence or that it was made unreasonable.

b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Smalls Claims Court in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator was satisfied that the requirements for the substitution service had been met by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the applicant the new hearing date. This was at the same time that personal service was being effected on the applicant's mother. Natural justice demanded that the appellant be heard. The respondent did nothing wrong in proceeding with the hearing. The court had sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did not attend the hearing, but was not prepared to interfere with this finding of the assistant adjudicator. Allowing the appeal, that it is a breach of the requirement for natural justice not to have a mechanism in Small Claims Court whereby, if defendant does not file a defence or appear at a hearing by mistake, but can show that he or she has an arguable defence that should be heard on its merits and is not just stalling, (emphasis added) and there is no prejudice to the claimant's ability to prove its case, the judgment cannot be set aside. In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small Claims court as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.",HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The applicant had failed to meet the requirements of the Federal Mortgage Act (FMA) and the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act (SFSA). The land had been purchased by a developer for development and was being developed at the time the action was brought. The developer was not a farmer but rather a developer. The Land was purchased by the purchaser and the purchaser made a series of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park. The purpose of the FMA was to provide protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. The purchaser was to receive a significant cash payout on sale. The redemption period was 90 days from the date of this decision.
b_2011nsca34.txt,". This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","Rule 4.07 – Rule 88.02 For the appellant, that he defended and took steps in the proceedings which precluded him from applying for a stay under s. of the Arbitration Act. More than two years after the suit started, he applied for stay. Leave for appeal was granted but the appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. Rule 8.07(3) assumes that a motion to dismiss must occur before the filing of defence because it directs the judge to set a time for filing the defence if the motion fails. Here, the respondent had taken fresh steps to advance the proceeding by producing a list of documents and providing additional documents and agreeing to discovery dates. More recently, he argued that a Chambers judge did not explicitly determine whether the applicant in Marineserve had attorned to the jurisdiction of the court. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed; the respondent's defence was not confined to a plea of 'no jurisdiction' as he denied the substance of the claim. Nor, unlike the respondent, was there any evidence that he was filing to avoid default judgment. Rather, he provided documents and attended discovery."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wanted to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. He had obtained a portion of his father's property from the family and continued to use it for many years before being blocked off by the Defendants. The plaintiffs had obtained another portion of their father's land from the Longard family and used the driveway to access their property. The Court found that the plaintiff had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the extent that it incorporates the driveway, and there was no expressed reservation as to the access road. Roy Longard asserted that he had obtained the land by way of the Bordens driveway, which he described as 'the other driveway'. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action against the Defendants for failing to provide the defendant with the reasonable and complete information required to establish a right of access to the property. 1)This permission extended by Borden to Eldard and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross the road created by a prescription or lost modern grant. 2)The defendant's claim to the right to access the home without a licence or permission from the owner of the servient tenement confers no right to the easement. 3)Having found the reasons for the delay in bringing this matter to Court, it is appropriate to conclude that the defendant has exhausted all reasonable means to achieve his goal of obtaining the same access road as the plaintiff. Having found the causeableness of the defendant's application in this matter, the Court finds that the defendants have failed to provide adequate reasons to terminate the action."

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the transcript was filed. The court found that the respondent had failed to either file the notice of appeal with the court or provide it with a requisition for the transcript. There was no reason for the non-filing, and the court ordered that the appeal be allowed on its merits. It would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed. The transcript was properly filed and the appeal set to proceed. There would be no order as to costs in the circumstances. There were three principles that apply in interpreting s. 39 of the Act: 1) the Act requires the appellant to take all required steps and then allowing for court intervention when matters arise beyond the control of the parties. This is an interpretation allowed by the wording used in the section. 2) It appears that an appellant to 'file the transcript' there is no action required beyond the request to Transcript Services. That agency then prepares the transcript and files it with the Court. In the result, the appellant plays no role in the physical filing of the transcript; rather, it must ensure the matter is properly served and filed and this appeal shall proceed to be heard on its own merits. 3) In situations where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice is done as between the party. This discretionary remedy is set forth in ss. 39(9). That subsection provides for a remedy in the event a transcript cannot be provided for the appeal. this is part of s.39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of a transcript and the failure to file within the six month provision, through the appellant. In that case, the court may make any other order that the judge considers appropriate. 4) To allow an appeal to go to a judge without the appellant having done anything incorrectly leads to an absurd result. This means the court cannot sit on its hands and allow delay to build without any consequence. 5) Interpreting the legislation in a manner that requires the the appellantto take all necessary steps and allowing for Court intervention when matter arises beyond the controlled parties is consistent with intention of the legislation. Furthermore, it avoids an absurd and unintended consequence."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant was sentenced to an 18 month custody and supervision order, 12 months to be served in secured custody, followed by months of community supervision. He appealed both his conviction and sentence. He contended the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the complainant's witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. He also submitted the sentence was unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The conviction appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found that an appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by the trial level court in only two circumstances: when the sentence is demonstrably unfit and when the appellant has failed to establish that the representation provided by trial counsel was incompetent, the appellant must establish that it is an error in assessment of credibility which puts the reliability of the verdict into question.  1) The evidence met the criteria set out in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775 and the principles of denunciation and deterrence as the paramount sentencing objectives. The trial judge properly instructed himself pursuant to the process outlined in Palmer to determine whether on the basis of the evidence that he had accepted, he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. It is more likely than not that the accused would comply with the condition conditions of non-custodial sentence. 2) The appellant had the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice. 3) He failed, in his minimal reliance on the former babysitter's evidence, which is corroborated by other witnesses, to meet the threshold for the admission of fresh evidence."

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant an adjournment because the accused's wife had been hospitalised and could not attend court. The trial judge found that the accused had not acted diligently and honestly in attempting to obtain counsel and that, in the course of the trial, his counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving him to conduct his own defence. The issues were whether the judge's refusal to grant the adjournment was based on reasons not wellfounded in law, whether the decision affected the accused’s right to make full answer and defence and to fair trial, and whether granting an adjournments in the circumstances would negatively affect the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice."

To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand.

The Court also found that the names of the former partners did not appear on the documents filed with the court and, therefore, the plaintiff should not be permitted to represent the applicants.

The respondent terminated the lawyer's employment with the firm in 1994 and retained her as his former solicitor. She now acted as the respondent's solicitor in this action. HELD: 1)An order was made that the respondent attend a further examination for discovery in July 1996 to be arranged in consultation with counsel and on 10 days' notice of the date set for the examination and payment of proper conduct money. 2)The respondent was to discharge the burden of proving that no confidential information has passed. 3)The application was for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement and to have the motion and documents related to this motion sealed.  4)The solicitor was to have her costs in the amount of $300 payable within 15 days of the judgment.
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","An appeal of a decision which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee and Executive Committee of the League did not accept the appellant's evidence as part of the appeal. They both chose to accept the evidence of the former principal of the school, who had also been charged in the same action with threatening to resign if he did not submit to a transfer request and resignation from the principal. The principal was charged with misrepresenting the school improvement process report, which was critical of the students, discipline, resource allocation and leadership. The discipline committee recommended that the principal be transferred. The former principal received a reprimand and a fine of $2,500. Both parties appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal and imposing the fine, that the Discipline Committee did not err in its finding of fact as set forth in the grounds of review, nor in its application of the burden of proof, which were not supported by the evidence, and in the manner in which they applied them."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant. The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act. The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for a declaration that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the personal property security act and s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act that the respondent as lessor was limited to a lien upon the articles sold only, notwithstanding any contrary agreement; an Order that funds currently held in trust for the action be returned to the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed. The proper forum to have the issues raised in this matter determined was the forum to which the action was commenced by the respondent. 1)The lease was a true lease as opposed to a'security' lease and denied the applicability of s18(1) of the Act and argued it would be inequitable to invoke it. The respondent did not take issue with the repossession. 2)The application was misconceived. This court lacks the jurisdiction to grant the relief requested under Part V of The Personal Property security Act.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. An application for determination of whether the defendant was liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for personal injuries sustained while on a field trip or whether the co-defendant was immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff. HELD: 1)In the event the defendant is not liable, the plaintiff's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. In the event Edith is immune then from liability the employer is only liable to the same amount as the driver and the same insurer for the injuries sustained as the child. 2)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provided that a negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of s.228 of the Education Act. Even if there were an apparent conflict with the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the Highwaytraffic Act extends the same immunity to owner as it does to the driver by operation of the same s86(1)."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 resulting from a fire which broke out in the Tower at the Kelsey Campus in January 1997. The defendants had filed statement of defence against the City of Saskatoon, Fire Chief William Hewitt and numerous architects and engineers. In issue was whether any of the plaintiff's witnesses were a participant in the investigation of the loss following the fire and whether the names of potential witnesses from whom he took statements during the course of his investigation revealed details of the appellant's investigation. HELD: The plaintiff's request for an expert opinion was refused. 1)The question asked was what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. The question was too vague to answer. 2)The plaintiff undertook in its argument to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to question of this nature when reference is made to document. The court failed to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is statute-barred pursuant to s. 3(3.1) of the Liability and Proceedings Act. 2) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s3(3(1)(b)(i)) of the LAA. That limitation period explicitly begins to run '...from the discovery of the cause of the action'. 3) There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury or damage ceased. The plaintiff alleges continuing injury and damage. That is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial.  4) In any event, the law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of its servants and servants occurring prior to June 1953. Although Haines J. v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, decided that a provincial court had no jurisdiction to entertain any claim arising from acts or omissions that predate May14, 1953, my decision is based on the narrower ground that this court has no authority to entertain claims arising from the intentional torts of officers and servants of the Crown occurring before the proclamation of Crown Liability Act on May 14/53. 5) Even if the time limitation period applies to claims other than those described in s3 (3) of this Act (i.e., even if the [R.J.G.] decision was wrong), time begins to Run under s2(1(a) of that Act only when the alleged injury/damage ceases. There is nothing to which the claim can be extended beyond that time. 6) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Attorney General pursuant to the Crown's Liability & Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents, they have failed to plead cause of actions that this Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship. The only issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agree all property has been divided to their respective mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility. The respondent is working part-time and the court is satisfied having regard to her education and obvious desire to remain in Sweden that lump sum payment is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances. HELD: The respondent will pay $10,000 to the respondent by way of lump sum support. 1) The court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. However, it is only when a lump sum is the proper vehicle for providing support or when lump sums are necessary to put a person in a particular position that such an award should be made. 2) There is a need on the part of the respondent, she is entitled to support, and there is capacity in the Court to pay support. 3) The respondent's evidence of intention to return to Sweden and the very high costs of her stay in Sweden are sufficient for the court to fix an amount to be contributed by the petitioner."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, claiming that it was an obvious overbilling. The applicant also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of an interim court order which granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The Respondent cross-examined the respondent and claimed that this was the only time she had ever been asked to participate in her client's legal affairs. During the taxation hearing, the respondent made a motion requesting that she be excused because of an alleged apprehension of bias. She also made a request requesting that Ms. Stevenson produce a copy of the email in question, which she could not recite. The parties had not reached an agreement on the settlement of the civil suit and the respondent had subsequently applied to have her retainer terminated. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence of bias on the part of the respondent, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, and who was able to take the position that her client was 'overbilled'. The respondent's evidence regarding the retainer was more than sufficient for the appellant to canvass the relevant issues. The trial judge's evidence concerning her client accurately reflected the actual time that she had to spend on her legal matters. There was no indication whatsoever of overburdening by the respondent's legal counsel."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; and conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the other counts. They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle. The Crown appealed the sentences, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking, lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for a criminal organisation and the fact their motivation was financial gain. Appeal allowed; the total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served; the sentence in both cases is 30 to 35 months imprisonment for the trafficking charge and 1 year consecutive for the substances prohibition under s. 467.12. The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. They all earned a lot and were doing well in the community despite the high cost of living. The Court found that the sentence imposed on the three respondents, taking into account their ages, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating factors of their offence, was demonstrably unfit in light that the offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. The total sentence imposed in this case was 30 months in the Canadian Court of Appeal, 30 months for each of the last two counts and one year consecutive in the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, they brought an amended motion for stay that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area and an increased seven year habitation requirement were challenged. The plaintiffs sought certification as a common law class proceeding. Application for stay dismissed; the parties and the court approached the December 2010 hearing as addressing an amendment to the original Motion, not a replacement for the motion which had been presented at the earlier sessions. Subject to satisfactory definitions, the plaintiffs' proposal to establish two classes of claimants property owner and residential would be reasonable and logical and would facilitate the management and advancement of the case. There was no evidence of how the plaintiffs would incur expenses for its pleading or document disclosure. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable Order of the Supreme Court."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the discovery subpoena was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules and there was a lack of certainty regarding the application of Rule 18.16 in terms of the order in which the witnesses would be discovered. The Defendant sought to have the plaintiff's designated manager for discovery excluded from the discovery examination of the witnesses. HELD: 1)The discovery was a routine interlocutory procedural matter and not a complex issue. The case law is applicable in that a corporate defendant has a right to be represented at discovery. Any award made on costs must be fair and reasonable overall. 2)The issuing of discovery subpoena (which in effect dictated the order of witnesses) made exclusion a mute issue. There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 3)The use of subpoenas in this matter should be frowned upon. In fixing the amount, the Court was of the view that party/party costs in this case should be increased as a result of the misunderstanding between the parties and the improper use of language. 4)The parties agreed initially that Rule 17.16 was applicable and that the plaintiff should have made its motion to exclude the defendant's representative, as was suggested by the plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. However, the defendant took the position that the discovery process was fundamentally unfair and that it did not have the proper opportunity to assess the appropriateness of the application. 5)The plaintiff was awarded costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has entered the conviction against the offender and prior to him being sentenced. HELD: 1)The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the Crown's dangerous offender application as contemplated by s.754(1)(a). The Court reviewed two additional events that are germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault contrary to the Code. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required, for a period of 1 year, to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and receive drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He is a high risk to re-offend violently in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. If he continues to deny his culpability and sabotage his attendance in programming, his risk to continue to perpetrate violent crimes will continue to rise. 2)The offender has serious health problems and is suffering from personality disorder. He required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired, in 2008 he had a stroke and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He has active hepatitis C. He was 46 years old at the time of the offence. He had a previous sexual assault conviction and is now in his fifties. He appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and does not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life. There is an absolute necessity that the offender make a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life to ensure his continued success. If the offender refuses to do so, the Court concludes that his risk for future violence will be high. He should be given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his behalf. The accused was found not to be indigent. He had not undertaken any necessary steps to secure financing or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel. He did not have a significant amount of equity in his home as he was unable to afford it and there was a cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to potential trial which would enable the accused to attempt to make arrangements for financing arrangements."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two children. Both parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. HELD: The application to vary child support by the respondent was granted. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change to be a material change it must be reasonable in the circumstances and the respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary the existing order, and the petitioner's application in this regard is dismissed."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal was reviewed and the errors that led to the granting of a remedy to the appellant were in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act. The Tribunal did not err in any respects and the appellant's position was accepted by the tribunal as well as the Board's recommendation and full reinstatement of his privileges. There was no real nexus between the rare condition and the other situations the Tribunal was called upon to manage in the course of the respondent's medical staff and practitioners. The errors led to a granting of the appellant a remedy and a full reinning of the privileges.  1) The Tribunal had the full record from the Board in front of it. The appellant and his wife were both qualified to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology but had licensure in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Both worked within the respondent Health Authority. 2) The appellant was suspended continuously since December 2014. There is some utility in identifying what the Tribunal had before it for consideration of the appeal de novo it was to address. In any event, the appellant’s counsel quite properly agreed to proceed in that fashion before the Tribunal. 3) The holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, how things could be improved and how to best protect the patient and others, or to avoid detriment to the delivery of quality patient care."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties applied to partition and sale of a lake front recreational property owned by them and their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another property that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed over and above the contributions of the others. Ronald says that these improvements have made his property more valuable and that he is under no obligation to provide these materials or work. He claims that the proceeds from the sale will remain in the family for the use of his children and grandchildren. HELD: 1) The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity it cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court has a discretion to refuse partition if it finds that the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the Respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious as those terms have been interpreted in Reed Reed (1985), [SCC] and Mack v. Canada (Attorney General) [2011] SCR 269 (Ont. C.A.). 3) If owners holding one moiety (a half interest) or more (Ronald) request partition and sales s. directs that the court may, unless it seems like a good reason to the contrary, direct Sale of the Property and Distribution of the Proceeds. It directs that if it appears that Sale of all of the proceeds would be more beneficial to the parties than Division of the property between them, the Court may, if it thinks fit, give all necessary or proper directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of theproperty.

The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.  1 year imprisonment was excessive. In addition, the appellant would lose his current employment opportunity. 2)The trial judge must have been influenced to a substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in a manner that was demeaning and destructive of her self image. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive.In addition, he would lose the current employment he was reliant upon."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants.

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.",A motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness.

If it was the will of the board elected pursuant to the above order to withdraw from Saskatoon it may do so. 2)The applicant was not directed to the closure of the Saskatoon operation. 3)The proposed remedy was to have the board of directors and the directors of the corporation consent to the service of the community bond agreement.

d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. He sold the business in 1989 to be sold to Atlantic Corporation. Atlantic Corporation was the auditor for the company at the time of the purchase. The trial judge found that the respondents suffered any consequential loss and, if so, caused by the over valuation of the inventory. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to be paid over to Adams at the closing. Given the trial judge's opinion that the financial statements of the respondent were inaccurate, it would be impossible for the respondent to establish his direct loss as a result of the misrepresentations made by the auditors. The court awarded indirect damages in the amount of $1,700,000, which should be added to the purchase price of $10,000. The award of consequential damages was not the correct test. It was the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty. It is impossible to quantify the loss from the outset of the transaction. Taking into account all of the liabilities the respondent was forced to incur in order to maintain the company and the equity and time and energy devoted by him and his senior executives to maintaining the company, the court was able to arrive at an award similar to that given by the learned trial judge."

d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the applicant received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The plaintiff Royal Bank refused to give an assignment to the Royal Bank and in the alternative, the plaintiff bank defended and counter-claimed against the defendant for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial, and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff bank's claim against the bank was dismissed in total. 1)Nothing of the counter-claimant's claims were upheld and they were dismissed in the total.  2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the EquaBank statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. 3)The Royal Bank did not act in bad faith or in breach of its fiduciary or contractual obligation towards the applicant.

The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health.

The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the judge that the accident in question did not contribute materially to the respondent's present poor health, and that the incident caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. Accordingly, the appellant awards him $25 million for general damages. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed. There was ample medical evidence to support the judge's conclusion that the automobile in question didn't contribute in a material way, to the appellant, and there is no basis, in law, upon which we can interfere with that conclusion. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case."

The applicant did not meet the test of a fairly arguable defence and gave no other reasons for not filing a defence other than his allegation that the documents were not served upon him.","The defendant applied for an order setting aside a default judgment on the basis that the plaintiff's affidavit and statement of claim were not served on him. The application was opposed and the defendant's pre-hearing memorandum, oral submission and cases referred. The defendant had reviewed the affidavits of several people and had not shown by his affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had not given any reasons for not filing a defence and, other than his assertion that the originating notice(action) and statement (statement of claim) had not been served upon him, and that he did not recall the circumstances concerning the particular service on which he had been served. The plaintiff's claim was also opposed in part because it was not clear why his wages had been garnisheed."
d_2001skqb50.txt,"The father applied to vary the Alberta order by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay child support. The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992. They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement. One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003. The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years. HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated. He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped. He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999. Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support.","The husband applied to vary the court's maintenance order from January 12, 1993 to the present, by eliminating any further obligation to pay maintenance for his children. The parties had executed a separation agreement in 1991 which agreed to joint custody of the children and in the event both children were living with one of the parties that the non-custodial parent pay maintenance of $175 per month per child to the 'custody' parent. This agreement was confirmed in September 1992. At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000 and by 1993 the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year. HELD: 1)The husband was ordered to pay $13,693 per year maintenance for the children. 2)The arrears of payment from 1993 to present were reduced to $5,213 based on the wife's representations to the court and her letter to the Maintenance Enforcement Office.  3)The father had improved his income during the relevant years and was entitled to periodic maintenance.  4)The court valued his ability to pay and found that it would not apply to the rest of his income if the circumstances had not changed."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The respondent father applied to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001 by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck on which he had been making payments of $624. He stated that he no longer residing with his girlfriend, with whom he shared expenses. HELD: The issue was whether the respondent was intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 1) Income should not be imputed to a payor based on a former employment that is no longer available or practicable. The material filed did not indicate any change in his circumstances since April 2001. 2)His circumstances had changed since April 1, 2001. He is now employed as tow truck driver, and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510. He bought a 1-half-ton truck. 3)His new employment situation did not justify any reduction in his child support obligations. The 'changed circumstances' did not support any reduction."
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","The testator left all of his property to his children, except for his jewellry and personal clothing, to be divided among them. His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form with handwritten portions indicating the disposition of his assets. It appears that from time to time the testator made attempts to make changes in his will, but these were not properly executed and witnessed. The testator provided that his children would have inherited their share of his estate'solely and absolutely' (except for the jewellery and clothing). This would have been enough for the surviving children to have been given their share. The court was not surprised that this would not have been the case."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the divorce proceeding. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) the allegation that the husband failed to provide her with an automobile; and 3) whether the wife had complied with the terms of the separation agreement by failing to provide him with one. The evidence supported a conclusion that the marriage had deteriorated to the point that it was impossible for the husband to provide the wife with a vehicle for the first time in his life. The wife had chosen to remain at home during the course of the marriage, primarily because she wished a smaller, more economical vehicle. Although the husband had given the wife an automobile, it was owned by his company and registered in the wife's name. The agreement clearly stated that the wife would have the vehicle for her own exclusive use and ownership free and clear from any claim by the husband. Spousal assistance was to continue for a period of fifteen months from April 2004 unless the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousals should continue. Given the uncertainty regarding the future of the husband's business, the court found that it would be more difficult for the wife to obtain a vehicle in her name when the husband retired from the workforce. Given that she had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home and was employed as a waitress, her banker informed her she required more monthly income to acquire the mortgage, which she needed to purchase a new vehicle. She was unable to obtain financing for the vehicle until December 2001, when she applied for a divorce judgment."

HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain.

The plaintiff's agent was accompanied by his regional supervisor when the contract was made. Both testified. The quantity was substantial and it was not surprising that both had clear recollection of the event.

The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.

The evidence of the plaintiff in cross-examination was that she wrote a cheque for $69,000 to the defendant. No written contracts or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant Kelly Eiswerth and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. There was no direct payment from the plaintiff to the defendants. The numbered company which had registered the name no longer carries on business.

Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents.

Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of their temporary guardianship order in Alberta. In 2005, an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child in 2005, the respondents temporarily relocated to Calgary and put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. On the same day that the permanent guardianhip order was granted, it was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order, under which the respondents became the guardians of the child not in the permanent care of an agency (subject to limited exceptions). Once notice of the hearing was given, the court is entitled to dispense with the birth parent's consent, if s/he fails to appear at the hearing, or in any event.

Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S. The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of a Child and Family Services judge sitting on appeal from an order in relation to the child K.W. who had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The child's father, R.S., appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence regarding his fitness to parent the child. The matter came back before the Minister on appeal. The application was dismissed. There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal. It is doubtful that during the transition period, the minister retains status as parent until the transition is complete and the child is returned to his father's care, and, if so, who determines when the Transition is complete? Taking the first ground, it seems entirely clear that from the very meaning of the word 'transition' and the wording of the order, that the minister is to retain status as a parent with the attendant decision-making authority until the complete transition is made, and that this period is subject to a number of conditions reflecting the recommendations in the psychological report. This power is not 'broad enough' to permit the judge to make an order that both returns the child to the custody of the parent, pursuant to ss.37(1)(a) and (b) and have the child remain in the child for a very long period, but, practically speaking, the order is fraught with ambiguity."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was paid an amount less than that of the respondent. The respondent appealed SGI's calculation of the IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident and found that the respondent's IRB should not be less than the amount received pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit (IRB) against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. HELD: The IRB was calculated using the weighted average approach used by SGI in calculating the post 180 day period IRB and then reduced the net income to 90%. The respondent was awarded the amount less then that of Montgrand.  1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of SGI for the first 180 day periods and the post180 day period to me. Counsel for the appellant now concedes that SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that the amount of interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 2) The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI is paying Montgrand an amount lesser than that. The hearing judge's interpretation of the Act and Regulations was that of ultra vires or of kind that may be read down to comply with ss. 116 and 117 of the Personal Injury Benefits Benefits Regulations. 3) The respondent's application to set aside the weighted average approach (SGI) used by the appellant in calculating its IRB is inconsistent with the approach used in SGI. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions are in keeping with his earning reality. 4) The legislation attempts to find the non earner's earning reality, and Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI (J.

He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in response to a 30 year non-compete clause which prevented it from operating a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business. The defendant had resigned from the company with an intention of opening a new business, which was imminent. The plaintiff brought an application for an interlocutory injunction to quash the injunction. Application allowed; interim injunction granted. The court found that the business was already facing a serious threat to its business and there was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company if the new business opened. The balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. This was no time to speculate when one considers a small community."
d_2012skqb513.txt,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","Civil Procedure – JudgmentSaskatchewan Government Insurance granted judgment in the amount of the Admin Fee recoverable under the doctrine of quantum meruit. The respondents were awarded judgment against the defendants for improperly charged and paid Admin Fees. The service and filing of notice of appeal dismissed the application. The plaintiff applied for a stay of all further proceedings in the action (other than the issue of the judgment and the taxation of costs under the judgment) pending the disposition of the appeal. The defendants object to the request that the court finalize judgment as contemplated by the paragraphs 103, 104, 113 and 114 of the original judgment.

In the event the parties cannot reach an agreement on what the judgment amounts to, they are to contact the registrar in order to arrange a time for argument on any points in debate. The costs and delay occasioned by multiple appeal hearings will be avoided. 1)The calculation of costs was not made until the Court of Appeal released its decision on the appeals. 2)The court was seized with the prospect of multiple appeals hearings and the potential delay and expense. 3)It was appropriate to calculate the judgment owing to the date of my original judgment based on the calculations provided. 4)The calculations were left to the parties to finalize."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","The trial judge found the plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was a small part of the claim. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple beam notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete-grade beam was not established at trial. The defendants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. The court found no evidence of a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of trial judge HELD: This appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judges made no evidential or overriding error in the calculation as to damages. While there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete-based beam, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the foundation, could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector, Hancock may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward. There is no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. 2) There is a high onus of establishing that a reasonably informed person would have an apprehension or reasonable belief that they received an unfair trial, such that an appellate court would interfere with a trial judge's determination of damages by way of reasonable and overriding errors in law. 3) In this case, the court was satisfied from the review of the transcript that Mr. Aubin had the necessary experience in respect to foundation and structural repair that he could give expert evidence as to whether the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in a traditional civil trial."
d_2014skca116.txt,"HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under a statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in s7(2), of which the Psychologists Act refers, respectively, to a 'psychologists Act' and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, and that s. 33(of The Psychologist Act) states that 'an appeal lies to the court from a verdict of the court of Queen’s Bench or a judge of that court. That is the general rule.' HELD: The application was dismissed. The question of when a right of appeal lies lies to this court from the decision of The Psychologists act, which refers to an express statement, which would fall into the first part of s.7(3).  1) It is of little relevance that many of the professional statutes are silent on the question of whether an appeal is possible in this Court unless the legislature has enlarged or diminished that jurisdiction. When the legislature enacted The Psychology Act, it ushered in a new era of clarity with respect to the jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Court as opposed to the Court's traditional role of sitting as a judge or officer of the College. This is an important step in resolving the complex legislative base that exists between the legislature and the court. 2) There is no need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals' in order to have them succeed. The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out. It is necessary to consider the general purpose of the Act, namely the objectives and purposes of that Court. 3) There are no precedents, no clear legislative intent, for the legislature to achieve the goal of reaching a conclusion that would resolve the issue of jurisdiction from a complex and ambiguous legislative base. There is a general rule that, whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court or Queen”s Bench, and is silent with respectto an appeal, such an appeal would fall within the context of that Act. 4) With regard to the nature of general appellate legislation, it is not strictly necessary to read the words of Swanson and Huerto other than to note that they are distinguishable. 5) The legislature amended The Registered Nurses Act in The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act in"
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The plaintiff was found not liable. The court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in a series of articles published on newspapers and websites. The plaintiff sued the defendants alleging defamation. The defendants denied the allegations, and sought an amended Statement of Claim to add the respondent as a defendant. The parties had not published any retraction or apology, nor did the defendant's counsel receive appropriate direction for submission of any further written material. The article was found to be full of untruths and distortions and the defendants believed that the plaintiff's reputation was so tarnished at the time of the articles that they did not suffer any damages or loss of reputation at all. The articles and their contents caused serious damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and caused her to have to have both her hands and feet amputated. She filed a wrongful death claim against the defendants. The respondent voluntarily stopped performing laparoscopic surgeries in order to assuage negative public opinion in his home province. The newspapers and their owners were not aware that the respondent had a previous tubal ligation on his property and thus had no personal financial exposure to him. They did, however, have a general interest in establishing that he was liable in defamation and acting as a mediator between the parties to resolve the issues. The fact that the article was published at a time when the plaintiff was having her surgery and the defendant had not been retained by the hospital and/or its insurer meant that the statement of claim would need to be amended. The amendment would also add that respondent to the list of persons to whom the plaintiff had been referred for medical treatment as a result of the publication of the article, thereby removing the reference to respondent in the article and removing the offending material from the website."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property and custody, including custody of the two youngest children, under The Matrimonial Property Act and The Infants and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching business was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. In the meantime, the respondent spent heavily on alcohol and spent more money on alcohol. He was in arrears of maintenance for the two younger children. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody on his own. 2)The applicant was to have her name shown on the property as her own. 3)With the exception of those items already shown for exhibit, the court deducted the respondent's name and custody. 4)The court was satisfied that the respondent dissipated the property within the meaning of the Act. He will be entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle and his tools and other properties in his possession as his own and the applicant will be given her household goods and household goods from her possession as her matrimony property.  5)The parties were to have custody of their two children from the date of trial. The father was to pay child support in the amount of $1,800 and the mother $8,000, leaving the matter to the court to have its custody and custody shown as to the two children."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.

The respondent had taken leave of absence from his employment to work in the provincial government and had difficulty maintaining a home. The petitioner applied for an order listing the home for sale and for a pre-trial conference which was to proceed in January 1996. The basis for this application was that the respondent took leave of leave in 1995 and had been considering a sale. The parties' primary residence was now debt free and the respondent was ordered to pay monthly spousals of $1,400 plus child support of $2,600.00.

She owned a fully furnished home and had obtained a full-time employment which enabled her to pay an extremely modest support obligation. She was to maintain the home and promptly pay taxes.  4)It was not unreasonable for the petitioner to infer that he made up his mind to avoid complying with the order for interim support.

Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.

The applicants had proceeded by fax message in 1996, when Bennett asked them to move their premises to another part of the Plaza to create a large block of space which Bennett proposed to lease to Corrections. At issue was whether a valid renewal of the head lease existed between the applicants and Bennett; whether valid renewals of subleases and their head lease met the requirements of s.4 of the Statute of Frauds; did the Court have jurisdiction to hear an application for relief brought solely by notice of motion?

Further, the Court's assumptions were not open to the trial judge. 2)The applicants fell short of constituting part of Part 4 of the performance for purposes of sec.11 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied.  3)Bennett did not tender the subleases it had sub-leased to the applicants.

It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of 1 year set out in The Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The amendment could only be considered pursuant to an application under s. 44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. On the basis of the foregoing the defendant was not successful. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments. 1)The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The fact that the plaintiff was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. 2)The court was constrained by only one rule: he must exercise that unfettered discretion judicially."

The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan.

The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction.

The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court had reviewed the definition of 'ordinarily resident' as it is used in the subsection and the time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication.  2)The court was not satisfied with the use of the word 'ordinary resident' for the purposes of the Foreign Judgments Act so turned to case law for assistance.  3)Saskatchewan was the first province to enforce a foreign judgment and it was not suggested that s.3(b) or (c)had application in this matter.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

She produced child care receipts for 2000 of $2,790 plus $1100 which is said to be owed to a family member. She estimated her child care expenses would be in excess of $4,000 this year. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of 1,000. 1)Once a material change has occurred in the circumstances of a child, the question becomes whether there has been any material change in the child's circumstances. Once again the evidence suggests that there has not been any change in material circumstances, the Court cannot rely on either the parties' agreed upon support in the manner requested. Once the matter becomes a question of material change, the court must be able to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. 2)The parties agreed to impute income of the respondent to the petitioner.

The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands.

The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects.

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. In February 2005, the defendants made an order directing that the plaintiff provide an order for leave to amend the statement of defence. The defendants deny that they have any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim. The plaintiff seeks costs of the application and cross-examination of the defendant on a solicitor-and‑client basis and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the defendant's statement of defense of all the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever it would be required to be paid to other shareholders, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.  2) The amount sought to be recovered by plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated in s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. The defendant's application for summary judgment does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2)."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town of Martensville to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs.  1)The plaintiff had no further standing and, having legally divested title and not received any less value on the sale of the property in the process, any claim at this point would have to be made by her daughter, not her. 2)The court could not find clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the court, to negligence by the defendant, thereby causing the damage to the property.  3)There was a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This could not be construed either as negligence or negligence in that circumstances."

e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had cut down some trees on his property, by mistake. The defendant had been friends with the plaintiff for many years and had offered to help remove the trees when the weather improved. The plaintiff had been reluctant to cooperate with the defendant because he regarded the trees as unhealthy. He took it upon himself to expand the project over several days, taking care of the rest of the trees himself, while avoiding any risk to the plaintiff's septic field. The claim against the defendant was dismissed. The court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach, either because the enterprise was itself unlawful or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant denies responsibility for the damage and questions the quantum of damages sustained. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. Whether the plaintiffs are pre-cluded by recovery against the defendant based upon the contractual terms acknowledging the Equipment is Water-Resistant and Not Waterproof and as wellas the posting disclaimers and mitigation.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation, in all the circumstances the Defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions. 3) The Court assesses the current value of the items at or near the rear door to be $800.00.  4) The amount of monies paid to the vendors for services such as bookkeeping, bookkeeping and the like. 5) The number of items to be water damaged in the amount of $1,250,000.00 to $1.5 million. The court was of the view that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs were nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading."

An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. The elements required for self-defence were not present. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant who was at large on his recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with F.M., except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim beneath the skin of his penis contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and for a sexual purpose touching the victim with the part of his body considered that person under the age of 16 years to be his biological father. The accused had a common-law relationship with the complainant, with whom he had two children: A. G. and K. H. (born approximately 1993); while he was stepfather to K. G.'s son (who was between 10 and 11 years old at the time of the offence), the accused's biological father (who had died shortly thereafter) lived in the same household as the complainant. The Court found that the four counts were all related to the same person and that the essential elements of the evidence were: 1) witness' credibility was mixture of reliability, reliability, impartiality or honesty. 2) the accused was consistent with independent witnesses which is accepted by the trier of fact; and 3) the internal consistency of the testimony was not an exercise in preferring one witness' evidence over that of another."
e_2012skpc80.txt,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while disqualified. The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric motor was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the impaired driving charge. The motor vehicle offence was defined by the Criminal Code as whether the scooter was a motor vehicle as defined by s. 253(1)(a) of the Code and was not subject to the breath sample requirement. The second charge was for failure to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) as there was no evidence before the Court regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence prior to the issue being heard. The third and fourth charges were dismissed.
e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a 61 year old single male suffering from epilepsy who lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, the most recent of which was 14 years ago. He is on social assistance and indicated he does not have any drinking or alcohol problems. The complainant was the friend of the accused's step-daughter. The parties were enjoying a party when the accused moved onto the bed and touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching her and touching her body. The touching was brief in both cases and no longer than minute. The evidence showed the complainant had some cognitive issues but she was not severely cognitively impaired. HELD: 1) The accused is guilty of both counts. He was sentenced to 30 months incarceration. 2) In R. v. Ashby, 2009 SKQB 369, the Court of Appeal held that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be a starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according to the aggravating and mitigating factors. The Crown provided a pre-sentence report, which provided pertinent background information. The probation officer conducted two risk assessments and the accused was assessed as at low risk to re-offend based on the information he had heard from the complainant. Aggravating factors included lack of remorse, sleeping complainant and small degree of violence."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Holgates and the plaintiffs were not acting in the best interests of the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. As the plaintiff possessed relevant information from a former client that could prejudice her in the within action, disqualification was automatic. The evidence showed that both parties agreed that the lawyer's job was to refrain from misusing confidential information from the former client and that it would be counterproductive to their motion in the present action to deprive the plaintiff of her choice of counsel. There was no delay in this case."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. of the Canadian Charter of Rights. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the impaired driving charge. At trial, the accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge specifically found that the officer relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing this finding.  2) On appeal, the trial judge reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada. R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 35 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527, [2010] SCC 45. 3) In his decision on the voir dire, the court held that it was not satisfied that the trial officer had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand on the accused. It was not concluded that the accused had alcohol in his body at the time that he was stopped by the officer. The evidence was found to be less than what society should expect from a police officer who has been trained in the use of the ASD. The officer, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand the accused provide incriminating evidence against himself'."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the judicial sale was granted. The reserve bid was set at $100,000. Although the assistance of a real estate agent is beneficial in obtaining the best price, it has long been decided by this court that another solicitor other than the plaintiff's own solicitor must direct the sale. This proposed order is not in accordance with Rule 10-47(2) and the corresponding form 10-45A make it clear the purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the Court. While it may be permissible to have an outstanding property taxes and real estate commission paid out of the proceeds of sale, the determination of reasonable costs allowed under the mortgage is a matter for the court to determine upon further application."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service for assault causing bodily harm. The trial judge had found that the respondent had used more force than was necessary to defend himself under s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code, but had also erred by failing to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the force used was not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and was not objectively reasonable. The Crown appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench as a summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the Provincial Court. The verdict was set aside and the Crown was given leave to appeal. 1)The trial judge did not err in the approach he took to measure the respondent's use of force and in disregarding the evidence of the complainant. This was a significant factor that raised significant doubt of the appellant's guilt.  2)In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the respondent was reasonably justified in kicking the complainant in the abdomen, driving him backwards and causing him to fall and injure his head.  3)There were a number of factors that must be considered in assessing whether a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is authorized in using as much force as is necessary for the purpose of making an arrest. The jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1), and s.34(1)(a) were well established and the principles to be applied are fundamentally similar to that of an officer in the field. 4)The Crown did not rely on the opinion of the trial judge that the amendments were prospective in effect. Rather, they chose to assess the subjective belief of a person in the circumstances of the day as opposed to the usual objective test of assessing whether the officer should have been required to protect himself or herself."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend the children. The accused kicked the complainant and hit her. The defence argued that the accused was not exercising criminal law power and that the entry to the complainant's suite would be contrary to her section rights unless that entrance and search was determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. HELD: 1) The evidence was excluded from the evidence.  2) It was not immediately apparent that the father had contact with the complainant. It was indicative that the mother did not believe he had authority under the criminal code to act, and that he wasn't attempting to act under the Charter. The fact that the worker had directed the accused not to have any contact with her does not alter that situation.  3) The totality of the evidence was to the effect that the respondent was an officer appointed by the Child and Family Services Act, and as such had certain powers under that Act. The respondent was not in hot pursuit of an individual and had not seen him at all that day and had therefore not pursued him to this residence. It is not open to the Court to conclude that any contact of the children with the respondent could be harmful to the children and they were immediately in Need of protection. The Court was of the view that the individual's actions could legally constitute an assault and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with Ms. Bigsky. 4) The Court could not conclude that the Court was in breach of the respondent's s. 16(1) Charter rights by the fact that she allowed the police officer to enter her apartment suite without her consent or knowledge of the reasons for the apprehension. The mere fact that a worker directed the respondent to allow them in did not alter the situation."
e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded.08 contrary to the s.255(1(a)) and  s.253(1)). The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the ASD demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused he made the demand, the breath tests were taken as soon as practicable. The defence argued that the 15 minute delay prejudiced the accused. The delay was unreasonable and detrimental to the accused’s s.8 right because the accused did not have two shots and did not display multiple signs or indicial of impairment prior to asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. The accused spent some time in the washroom, in the phone room and in the bathroom, after which she spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. She spoke to counsel for 30 minutes before calling City of Saskatoon services and tow trucks. HELD: There were two squad cars and three officers on the scene and the accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene till 6:12 a.M. This delay was not satisfactory. The need to take the tests as often as practicable is one which must be applied with reason. A rudimentary, or even a perfunctory perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the accused's interaction with counsel at the outset. The reasonable suspicion standard may be law, but it requires something more than mere hunch. The Police Department had to be permitted more leeway when there was two squad car and three police officers on scene. Having regard to the evidence and the existing law, that threshold has been met.  1) The accused did have to be arrested and the delay may have prejudiced her. There was no compelling reason, or need, to wait for the tow truck or police officer to arrive at the scene. 2) In this instance, a rudimentary, if any, perctory, examination of the video tape would have showed the accused through the haze of uncertainty that was engulfed by the accused at the onset.
