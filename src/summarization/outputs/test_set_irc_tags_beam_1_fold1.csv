2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998 and in 1999 they would switch the child every second day and then in 2000 they ceased to coexist. In 2000 they stopped communicating and in 2001 the child resided with the petitioner. The respondent has had access. The petitioner asserts that the every second weekend access was interrupted by a couple of violent episodes in the past. Counsel for the petitioner argued in chambers that the respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and reasonable access. There is plenty of affidavit evidence that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. The child is likely affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties.  1) The status quo is the current status quo. The children have and do reside with respondent with the access and visitor arrangements to be made. The mother has provided suitable care and has met the child's needs. The father wishes to change the status quo on an interim basis to have the child have custody. The court shall take into account the current situation in the child household, the current circumstances of the parties, the petitioner's income for the purposes of interim child support and the child’s current living arrangements. The current status is quo. Both parties are doing well and have a loving, stable relationship with her mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner’ best interests. The affidavits of the parents and their family members and relatives satisfy the court that the mutual love, acceptance and overall concern for the best interests of the children is self evident and commendABLE. 2) The child had and does resides with the mother with access to the husband with access. He shall pay interim child and visitation in the amount of $193 per month commencing December 1, 2003 and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. The primary caregiver is the father of the daughter. The second child is the petitioner who resides with her. The wife has provided for the child such that she does not forget her responsibilities. The husband has provided reasonable access and the petitioner has reasonable access on a second weekend. The Court shall have reasonable access including every second Sunday, every second"
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, or in the alternative, in the case of the appellant, the Sheas, or the applicant, the Bowsers, in an application for mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. They sought costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete indemnification of their costs of litigation, as concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute started in May 2011 and was generally conducted in civil fashion as evidenced by the SheAs' consent to late filing of the Notice of Contest by the Bows' and the Bows') consent of the late filing the Rebuttal Affidavit. Ultimately, the sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct."

2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, by wounding and possessing a weapon for purposes dangerous to the public peace. The accused claimed that the accused struck him in self-defence. The evidence established that the assault was in self defence. The Court found that the self- defence argument was not supported by the evidence and the accused's evidence was not credible. The court also found that when the accused walked toward the accused and struck the victim in the arm, the accused made no motion to use a knife. The defence evidence did not support the accused’s claim of self-defense and the Court found the accused placed himself in the role of aggressor."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed damages for the loss of its motor vehicle. The insurer agreed to repair the vehicle and deducted depreciation for depreciation. The parties did not communicate with each other as to the amount of depreciation. HELD: 1)An express election is not necessary. The respondent elected to repair or replace the vehicle pursuant to statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. 2)The respondent was not entitled to any deduction for depreciation under either condition. 3)The claim was abandoned. The action was continued by the plaintiff against the insurer, Saskatchewan Government Insurance. 4)The parties agreed to pay the $503.73 deducted for depreciation and the $1,518.66 for the repairs. 5)The respondents elected to pay $503 for the repair and the respondent was entitled to claim for the $2,518, which was the amount deducted for the depreciation. 6)The return of the monies paid by the respondent to the repair was not an express election. The claim was for the entire repair and repayment of the outstanding debt. 7)The Court found that SGI, by its conduct, had elected to fix the vehicle. 8)The Respondent was entitled, pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, to pay costs for the replacement of the exhaust system. 8 (1)The Return of the Monuments was not intended to be an express or exclusive election. 9)The conduct of the respondent is not an election. It is an election under statutory condition 7(4). In this case the respondent elected not to repair. The monuments were not awards. 10)The plaintiff was not awarded costs for any repair or improvement which exceeded the limits of the statutory condition 9. In this sense, an express and exclusive election is for the benefit of the parties and is not the same as an election to reinstate."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner father sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody with the father. The Court found that the mother and grandmother had been very close in age and had been discussing the possibility of having the child live with them for the past year. The father was working long hours and living in an apartment with his father. HELD: 1) The petitioner father was ordered to pay child support of $250 plus applicable court costs.  2) The mother was to have access for 30 days and then $500 plus applicable costs. 3) The father had no effective communications with either of the respondents regarding the physical aspect of where the child might reside or go to school if she moved with her father to the City of Calgary. The child's mother was much more stable and the court found that her relationship with her daughter was not fractured. The mother's relationship with the child was not fostered by the father's constant presence in the home. The court found it necessary to have the child's parents live in a different city so that she could have a better understanding of her surroundings and the psychological burden that a child can bear when adults behave indiscriminately."

The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an access order for a child of the parties respecting the child [A.K.L.], born in 2000. HELD: The application was allowed and the order for fine and an order that the respondent bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. The mother was in contempt because she deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She continued to be in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The court was of the view that the mother will not again disobey court orders so that fine is not called for in the circumstances. A substantial reduction in the value of the child's visit to SaskS is considered in the best interests of the family. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the petition has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the Child to Saskatut for access. Hearsay: The August 2002 order of Koch J. is vacated. The August 2003 order of J.C.H. is upheld. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the husband deliberately disobered the court orders by repeatedly refusal without lawful excuses to comply the terms OF the order (almost without exception she refused make the Child available for supervised access visit visits that are ordered every 2 weeks over the four- month period fromAugust to December). She continued in contempt by moving with the Child in February without prior Notice to the respondent. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The Child was almost two and one-half years old. The trial judge was satisfied that the wife deliberately disobey the court by repeatedly declining without lawful reason to complywith the terms (almost Without exception, the respondent refused to made the child accessible by telephone during the access visit). She was in a contemptuous position because she had not been properly notified of the value proposition. The petitioner was awarded solicitor and client costs."

If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner had petitioned in 1991 for custody andaccess, child support and divisions of the property. In 1992 Osborn granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month and child support in the sum of $800 for the maintenance of the two children and $400 for the wife's expenses. An application by the husband to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J. in May 1993. HELD: 1)The petitioner had a beneficial interest created by the order of the court sufficient to support registration of a caveat in the three following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. 2)The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission was to transfer the sum to an RRSP as may be prescribed by the wife. 3)The respondent was to pay the sum payable to the petitioner for her support of $300 per month plus interest at the rate of 5% for the sale of the lands to facilitate the payment of the amount then outstanding. 4)An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected.

2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The court found that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the defendant and entitled to claim the contractual amount. The plaintiff’s position was that the German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. The documents submitted by the defendant were purportedly copies of the German documentation and were not admitted into evidence. The issue was whether the plaintiff was aware that the miller had rejected some oats as being of a high quality and whether the defendant had taken steps to ensure that the farmer’d oats had not been rejected. The defendant had not disclosed this to the plaintiff. The Court awarded the plaintiff $51,608 to satisfy the contract and to have pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51.608 paid to the individual who had been awarded the sum previously owing. The claim against the defendant was for pre--judgement interest on $51.,608 from September 2006 until the date of judgment."

The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions to proceed to Step 2 of the verification process. The appellant argues the Administrative judge exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring MLG to pay the disputed account of a non-party relating to matters wholly unconnected to the action. The Administrative Judge directed the parties to determine how the verification could be completed without breaching solicitor client privilege. The respondent argues the administrative judge erred in finding that the parties agreed on a common database for the purpose of verifying the applicants' accounts.

In this action, the appellant seeks damages against the respondent for breach of his Charter rights. The parties are granted leave from this action to appeal this decision. The appeal is allowed on the basis that the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike down the appellant’s statement of Claim. The issue of crown immunity is not a question to be tried on a preliminary application under the Trade Union Act. Rather, it is a matter which is properly raised prior to trial to raise a point of law for argument upon agreed facts. The only proper method of having the issue issue of the Crown immunity determined before trial was on a proper application under Rule 14.25."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The 29 year old farmer was charged with uttering threats to cause death to his wife, mother and children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The wife had recently lost a son who had recently passed away and she and her son had been involved in a very bitter family fight. The accused claimed that his grandmother had told him that if he brought the police out, they would shoot them all and put them in plastic bags. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The application was allowed on the basis that the evidence of prior convictions was not relevant and that there was no evidence that the accused had actually said anything to the wife regarding the alleged threats. The Court found that the statements of the accused and his sister were true and that they were not intended to be threats. As the wife had no memory of what she said during the telephone conversation, she could not have missed hearing the accused say that. The court found that there must be precision as to what was said during a conversation and in what order. The words used and the meaning of those words were important. The evidence was properly explained to the jury."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were not charged with any offence. The defendants had not been prosecuted for any reason. 2) The fact that the defendants had refused to comply with the zoning bylaws does not change the fact that they are on public reserves and are subject to federal regulation is irrelevant. 3) The Defendants were not prosecuted for breaches of the bylaw s.197. The Defendants had been subject to numerous complaints and investigations by the Province and the Department of Municipal Affairs, resulting in numerous charges. The charges did not appear to rest on a reasonable basis on the evidence. The evidence was conclusive that the defendant had not obstructed the view of the natural scene without man-made objects blocking it. 4) The defendant was found not guilty of any of the charges."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered injuries caused by the defendant. HELD: The Court answered the question: Did the motor car accident cause or contribute to any of the plaintiffs injuries or damage?  1)The court accepted the opinion of the medical doctor based on his review of various medical reports and his experience as a mechanical engineer. He opined that the shock absorber mechanism comprising part of the rear bumper of the vehicle was capable of absorbing the force from another vehicle at speeds up to 8 km/hr without sustaining any damage. 2)The Court was not prepared to accept the opinion by the other doctor as to causation of the pain. The court found that the symptoms of the back pain were caused by pre-existing injuries and not the collision. 3)The medical doctor was not qualified to give an opinion as to the causation of injury in the human spine because his research appears to be limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports. He had not reviewed the original reports or any of their subsequent reports. 4)The pain and discomfort experienced by the female plaintiff relate to pre- existing injuries and to two mishaps that pre-date the collision"
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault, sexual touching and invitation to sexual touching. The accused was found to be in possession of a laptop computer and several pictures were found on a computer monitor. The search was conducted on the premises of the accused and was authorized. The court questioned whether the information obtained was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 7 of the Charter, and whether evidence obtained should be excluded. The defence argued that s. 8 of the Code was breached. The plain view doctrine only permits seizures of items in plain view, and does not permit further searches not authorized in the warrant. The ITO did not permit any further searches under the warrant nor did it disclose the information contained in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures searched. The Court found that the search was lawful and that the accused's rights were violated. The evidence obtained was not relevant to the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The cumulative effect of the errors was that the Court could not, in the form presented, support the issue by a Justice acting judiciously. The warrant to search was invalid because it authorized a search of the computer but did not authorize a search under s. 10(b) of the Criminal Code. The arrest and handling of the complaint was not the focus of the voir dire as it was only tangentially raised. The issue of whether the justice could have issued the warrant with the information was not a fatal flaw. The fact that the ITOs were not properly catalogued and the photographs were not included in the search warrant did not serve as a sufficient indication that the justice had not been properly informed of the material sought. The lack of consistency in the wording of the ITo and the omission of information of questionable relevance did not result in a denial of rights. The application of the Court's finding that the court could not support the issues raised by the voirs dire as there was no evidence to support the warrant or to justify its enforcement. The portion of the report prepared by the social worker and the lawyer that was referenced by the accused was not sufficient to support her s. 5 Charter rights to be included. The portions of the affidavit which were reviewed by the Court were not sufficient evidence to determine the validity of the search. The affidavit was not considered sufficient evidence by the justice to support a warrant by the court acting judically. The voir- dire was conducted at the application of SCC in R. v. Vu and it was concluded that the defence could not have obtained"
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom. HELD: The plaintiff’S cause of action is that he suffered damages as a result of Nord’d negligence in naming him as a beneficiary. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the date that judgment and his costs to be taxed are dismissed. The claim against Nordstrom was dismissed. 1)The defendants were named as a defendant. No evidence was led against them and the claim against it was dismissed without order as to costs for or against it. 2)Although the disappointed beneficiary principle has usually arisen and may well usually arise in the context of solicitors and will preparation, this “disappointed beneficiary” principle is not function merely of the defendant’’ occupation. The defendant was professional who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. His completion of the beneficiary designation on the application form could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff”s mind. 3)The plaintiff suffered damages from Nordstrom’ll negligence in failing to ensure that his objective was achieved. The pre-judicial interest claimed by the plaintiff was also made for excess probate fees paid by the estate. That was debt of the estate and no action having been brought on its behalf, this portion of the claim was dismissed as well."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is working part-time and the child is attending university. HELD: 1) The respondent failed to obtain support for both children. The child is not a child of the marriage inasmuch as he is not dependent upon his parents for the necessaries of life. His expenses are sufficient only to cover his tuition and books and the contribution from his father. 2) The petitioner's income is $1,000 per month. The table amount of support awarded is $2,153 per month based on the respondent's income of approximately $80k. 3) The Court was satisfied that the children were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither could withdraw from the charge of their parents. The Court found that it was not inappropriate to award the amount prescribed by the applicable Table."

The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque, where payment does not satisfy just debt. The defendant had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The certified cheq did not satisfy a just debt as the defendants had already received payment for their services. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants motion must be dismissed as the plaintiff’s statement of claim adequately discloses a cause for action in mistake of facts/un just enrichment. The Court must assume that all the allegations in this case possess sufficient evidence to support the claim. The facts in this instance suggest that the bank had an action for restitution against both the plaintiff and the holder certified checeque as payment did not satisfied just debt and the defendants were already receiving payment for the services. As the plaintiff had already deposited the replacement, and the certified cheques did not constitute a just Debt, the claim cannot be defeated on that ground."
1991canlii2445.txt,"This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant was found guilty, in a disciplinary hearing, of four charges relating to securities issues. The charges were all matters of the Trade Union Federation. The appellant had worked for the trade union representing former employees for the company and had received money from them for consulting and selling securities. He had also been found guilty of two charges relating the blind trust of federal cabinet minister, taking part in'side deals' (trades) in securities not approved by his head office and failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals. He also had been found not guilty of three charges relating bar (i) a breach of a by-law which established a disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct which was not his responsibility; (ii) failing to keep proper records of the transactions; and (iii) failing not to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals (which he had done in breach of another agreement). Allowing the appeal, that although the Board's findings were not supported by the appellant's allegations, they were nevertheless supported by his evidence that they constituted errors of law which constituted breach of the by-laws. The Board acted in good faith in finding the appellant guilty of these charges. It was open to the appellant to lay charges and he could not have done so because the bylaws of the Board did not recognize his affiliation with the trade unions or the associations."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.",The plaintiffs brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 222 and 232 for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogatory; an additional order directing the defendant Board to provide the plaintiff with the name of the person who had provided the requested information during the surgery. The second application was also adjourned sine die. The Court was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination.
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The first access issue was for the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second was for regular access. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence that any material change in circumstances would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. The schedule as detailed by the court was one of interim access. The access provisions were for two weeks each week, one week off and two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each. 2) The petitioner was employed for two years and had worked every day for two and one week on a five day week. He still worked two weeks of 12 hour days followed by a week off. The increased access he sought during these periods was unlikely to result in meaningful time with the children either before he went to work in the morning or after his return from work in evening. 3) The Court found no reason to vary the access from every third weekend to every weekend. The application was dismissed."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The application for strike of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was based on the argument that SMI was in a special relationship with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs were policy holders of the defendant's policy and this policy was not relied upon for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs in any event of the cause. 2) The court found no evidence that S MI was in an adversarial relationship with plaintiffs and therefore, refused to settle the claim for less than the said loss. 3) The only evidence that the defendant would submit to a reasonable standard of conduct and comply with the plaintiff’s claim was the statement of claim. The court reviewed the various types of action and found that the most severe case was the one brought against the plaintiff in which the plaintiff submitted that the defendants had entered a reasonable and binding contractual relationship to settle for less then the said amount. 4) The plaintiff was entitled to seek damages for the loss of the policy. The defendant was entitled not to pay the claim but to attempt to limit the liability of the first defendants."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by attempting to obtain information from a person who was impaired that could be used to obtain evidence for impaired driving. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and s2 of the charter affected the accused's privacy, liberty and human dignity as well as the accused’s admission that she was in her own home. The police officer’d been accompanying the accused around the house and around the home so she did not lose eye contact with her and, in addition, the arrival of other officers on scene and placing the accused in handcuffs outside the police car and requesting she go down to the police station initially, find more objectionable. The accused”s behaviour was similar to that of the accused on the charge of driving but was different in that the accused was in the home and doing her own investigation. The officer was conducting a search for a possible impaired driver when she knocked on the door and observed the accused when she opened the door. The Court reviewed the cases and found the unreasonable search was contrary to S. 8. It affected the lives of the people in the house, the accused had been advised of her right to be informed of her rights and the accused would be severely inconvenienced. The voir dire was voided. The court found the accused not guilty of impaired driving on count two. The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and there was little if any evidence to support the charge. The observations that the officer made from engaging the accused at the door are very similar to the one in Rogers. The officers were conducting a warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to a dwelling house. The evidence will be excluded. The facts are almost identical. The only difference is that the police officer knocked on her door and she did nothing to ask the officer in and as she was the officer” s. 2 of the Code. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permitvenient communication with the occupant. The Vanwick case was different from the Rogers case. Although the Crown did find the police Officer behaviour egregious, the Court found the Charter breach is serious. The conclusion that the unreasonable searching contrary to Section 8 has affected the person’S privacy, Liberty and Human dignity and the Court noted that cases such as Gro"

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","FIAT: The plaintiff brings a class action against nine defendants. The plaintiffs claim they are entitled to severance from the defendant for various matters relating to their dealings with each other and to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. The defendant carried on business as Dumur Industries. The issues against the defendants are separate and amount of time that would ordinarily be required to attend one portion of the trial would be deducted. The defendants deny any involvement in the divestiture of their assets or in the dispute between Morrison and the Walbaum Group. HELD: 1) The claims against them play a small part in the larger action against the Walbarge Group. The facts supporting the plaintiffs' claim against the defendant are different from the facts supporting its claims against the Sims, Gabriel and Dumurs. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required in portions of the litigation in respect of the Walba Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) The defendants bring separate motions pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against each of the defendants or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs’ claims against The Sims, The Dumurs and the Sims have been decided. 3) The plaintiffs are entitled at the end of the day to pay their costs. 4) The plaintiff is entitled at that time to judgment for pecuniary losses of approximately $19,000. 5) The defendant will be relieved of his costs on any date not designated by counsel for the plaintiffs or designated by the trial judge for adducing defence evidence and presenting argument.  6) The respondents will be permitted to attend portions of trial in respect the Wala Group. 7) The applicants are entitled on a lump sum basis to pay costs. 8) The respondent will be awarded general and special damages for peculiary losses in the amount of $19.5 million. 9) The applicant is entitled to judgment in respect to costs of preparing and preparing evidence against the plaintiffs. 10) The court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether the grant an application for severances.  11) The parties should not be precluded from adduce evidence related to the Wals' dealings with the applicants or required to segregATE the evidence in two, 3 or four separate trials.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel which reinstated the respondent as an employee as held in December 1994. The panel had found that the respondent's termination of employment was a culminating incident as the respondent had not followed the terms of the mutual agreement and was prepared to quit his employment. The respondent was reinstated to his employment position immediately. The period from August 1993 to the date that this Award was being treated as a suspension without pay was considered a suspension. The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident, which amounted to a culminating punishment. The Board ruled that the applicant be reinstated immediately and that the penalty imposed by the Board was a suspension of 16 months without pay for 16 months. HELD: 1)The Board's interpretation of the Mutual Agreement was patently unreasonable. 2)The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of verbal evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the termsof the written document. 3)The applicant took the position that the Board's decision to not apply the principle of culminating event was not a patently unjustified action. 4)The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents."
c_2018skqb29.txt,HELD: The application was dismissed.

It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT: The applicant/petitioner applies for a variation of an interim order issued by the Court in August 2007. The order was based upon the petitioner's income of $48,196 and the respondent's income $0. The parties agree that they have reasonable arrangements for the child's support. The applicant also seeks an order from the Court terminating his obligations for payment based upon respondent's failure to obtain employment of any significance since the order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order.

The Court has found that a material change of circumstances does not constitute a material Change of circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payor’s obligation to pay child or spousal support. In the circumstances, the applicant has met the threshold obligation to satisfy the Court that there is a material “material change in circumstance” to support the application.

Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","HELD: The Court held that it did not believe that the respondent had the ability to pay child support.

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property, and had also tended to gardens and other native vegetation. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act on behalf of the purchasers/defendants for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasing/occupation of the lot was without merit. The sufficiency of the evidence in this application was not a valid objection to the lot's title."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied pursuant to section 753 to have the accused designated a dangerous or long-term offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long- term offender. HELD: The Court held that on a dangerous offenders application, the Court must now also consider whether the subject of the application might be a long term offender, despite the fact that the requirements of s.753 have been met. The Court proposed to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which interpreted the 1997 amendments differently from the English version. The court found that the statutory requirements for finding a dangerous person are set out in s.730(1) of the code. The sentencing judge may, on application made under this Part following the filing of an assessment report under s.786(2), find the offender to be long-Term offender if it is satisfied that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence. The accused had been in three separate relationships, one of which involved domestic violence. The other two relationships involved sexual assault. The police were called to the accused's residence after he assaulted his sister and threatened to stab her and her family member. The parties were involved in various incidents throughout their lives and were involved throughout the course of the predicate offence. There were numerous incidents during this period that the Court was concerned about. The offender had committed three separate sexual offences against his sister, one involving stabbing her and one involving physical violence. During this period, the accused had lived in poverty, had a serious alcohol problem and had three children. The father had recently moved from his third relationship and was working and living in poverty. The mother of the children had recently become involved in domestic violence issues. The appellant had recently opened a relationship with an Aboriginal elder. The two parties lived together for a significant period prior to the offence and had been involved in many incidents of domestic violence related matters. The respondent had three previous relationships and one with an elder. He had been to three separate youth court hearings involving the predicate and predicate offences. The issues before the Court were whether the Court should seek an indeterminate sentence for each of the offences, to account for the absence of evidence concerning attempts to control the offender's behaviour in the community and the absence or absence of an expert who could provide an opinion on the issues."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c). The receiver of the plaintiff corporation Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers. The dealerships provided financing for the plaintiff. The plaintiff vendors objected to the propriety of a court appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. The parties argued that ss. 50 and 3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. HELD: 1) The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the plaintiff and the CNH group and to the Interpretation of the Code of the Agricultural Implements Act. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the plaintiff to refuse to restock direct ship parts. 2) The contractual provision that the plaintiff is entitled to refuse restock the direct ship part is overruled by ss. 5(2) and (3) serve in certain situations. 3) Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary contractual provision, the agreement was not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. There was nothing special about the product, about the dealer's use of it, about its use of the product or about the ability of Wheatland to sell its products to retail customers. The relationship between the parties was not one of convenience. The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' which in common English language usage would surely be the case. 4) The plaintiff was entitled to recover its losses on the direct shipment of parts. 5) The direct ship items were sold at auction, yielding net sale proceeds to the receiver of $19,059.26. The issue does not end there. The obligation extended to the plaintiff by paragraph 4.2 includes only assets that are not 'NHCC Financed Collateral'. The contractual right of the defendant to refuse (and the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse) is subject to s50(14) of the Bankruptcy Act. 6) The present and future assets of Wheatlands are to be divided into two categories: inventory and credits paid for by the plaintiff for its use and for use by its retail customers; and goods and services. 7) The CNH companies contend that the agreement is not the Same as the receiver seeking to alter the priorities of the various claimants. 8) The parties have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the priority agreements. The receiver contends that the word'specially ordered' as used in s.50(13) does not mean special or'special' and"

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant based on a single-car accident which occurred 25 years earlier. The defendant had died in a motor vehicle accident 25 years prior. The plaintiffs sought an order disallowing the limitation defence on behalf of the defendant, alleging that he was the driver of the vehicle 25 years ago. The defendants had commenced the action 25 years later. The action was commenced in 1997. The plaintiff subsequently received death threats from her uncle and other family members. She subsequently sought legal advice and eventually obtained a restraining order restraining the limitation period from starting to run. The Defendant applied to disallow the defence, arguing that the limitation was not enforceable because it did not exist 25 years after the defendant's death. Dismissing the application, that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that they were entitled to rely on the application of the fraudulent concealment principle, which was neither pleaded in the Statement of Claim nor available in the pre-trial procedure, nor was there anything approaching a satisfactory evidentiary basis upon which to make a finding of fraudulent concealments on the part of the Defendant."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT.

c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s.(23) ofthe Act and an order under ss.37 (1)(b) of that Act granting them custody. The Agency requested the additional information on the foster parents. HELD: The Agency's revised plan is appropriate in the circumstances. Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b)of the Act. As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is not an appropriate solution. The fact that the father has agreed to a long-term order recognising that he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable and nurturing environment to his children is more easily accommodated."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 1/2004. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders retroactively. This is the sole issue before it. The Court will also consider applications for variation of the existing support order. 2) The parties have been married for more than thirty years and have two children, ages 18 and 15. 3) The respondent has always lived close to each other. The parties cannot be compared to debtors and creditors. Their relationships are far more complex and personally intertwined. The fact these agreements have not been put in place does not effect the effect that the retroactive award may have on the parties. The court will not intervene to quell conflict between the parties.'"
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and for contravening his Charter rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter. The accused applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under s. 8 and s. 10 of The Charter were violated. HELD: The evidence was excluded under ss 24(2). 1) The accused was not aware that he was being detained for an offence under the CDSA or that he had a previous conviction for auto theft. The police officer who had first approached the accused at the scene of the motor home during the search of the vehicle testified that the accused was unusually nervous and that his hand was trembling as he handed over documents. He did not ask the accused to remove his sunglasses or put out his cigarette. The officer who first approached him at the door testified that he did not look at the license and registration that had been produced by the accused, but at the interior of the car and noticed that there were two plastic bags containing bricks of cocaine. The plastic bags were found in the seat of the accused's vehicle. The evidence could not be excluded under s9 of the Code because the accused had not obtained a copy of the driver's licence or registration. 2) The Court found that the evidence was not excluded under either s9 or s. 11 of the charter. The Court considered that the issue of whether the evidence should be excluded was a question for the officer who was first approached by the the accused and then by the officer that had first come to the scene. The first time either of the officers asked the accused if he was on any medication and when he last used any liquor or narcotics, he said that he used liquor the week previous and narcotics a long time ago. The second time they asked the driver if he had last used narcotics, the accused said that they had used liquor a week previous. The third time they both asked the vehicle's registration and VIN number through the BC License Bureau, which was an erroneous understanding of the information on the part of the Communications Centre. The motor home had been issued only one license plate and two temporary operating permits. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags. The word'sofia' appeared on the third layer of the plastic bags"
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. The claim was dismissed when the plaintiff's physician confirmed the existence of a bleb. The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as he had a pneumothorax which had already collapsed twice in his lung. The physician who treated the plaintiff for the bleb had returned to Saskatchewan to continue his studies. The insurance policy exempted the plaintiff from liability for the surgery because of a pre-existing condition. The medical evidence showed that the definition of a 'pre-existing' was not clear and did not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment for $26,864.46 prayed for together with costs to be taxed. 1)The definition of an 'existing condition' is not clear. The definition of the policy does not operate as a relieve MSI from its obligation under the policy to extend to the plaintiff the benefits for which he sues in this action. 2)The medical evidence was reviewed. The diagnosis of the blebis was not necessary since the plaintiff was symptomatic with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea on exertion and at risk of developing tension pneumothorrax if subjected to air transportation or pneumothoria becoming larger due to the delay of prolonged ground transportation back home to Canada. Delaying surgery until the patient returned to Canada could place the plaintiff in jeopardy and not be standard of care for treatment of recurrent pneumothorisax. 3)The criteria for excluding a pre existing condition is not clearly and does not function to relieve the insurance company of its obligations to extend coverage to the applicant for the purposes of the action. The court must strive to give effect to the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured. 4)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the sum of $26.46 sought."

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years.

The parents have separated from STS and have separated. SST will not intervene unless STS has a medical reason for doing so. SIST will not be involved in any way other than pursuant to a written consent order. The court will refer to the evidence in this case as a recommendation of SSS. The Court will not refer to STS's recommendations in this application. The questions also refer to testimony of the mother who has recently commenced a course at SIAST. If STS is not available, STS must be returned to her care. SNS is not an appropriate person to represent the children. SDS is not entitled to custody of any of these children pursuant to SSSA. STY is not a person who can and should be given custody of all of the four children of the family. STR is not responsible for any of this child's needs. SUST will not exercise his or her discretionary authority to provide"

Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The estate was under attack by the Grampians for failing to provide the guidance and companionship that the deceased would have been provided to her grandchildren. The estate applied for an order excluding them from discovery examinations. The deceased's estate had been under attack for some years and the estate had refused to admit any of her grandchildren into its discovery examination. The granddaughter claimed damages for loss of guidance, care and companionships which would have gone to the deceased. The Executor and Trustee sought exclusion. The Defendant applied to have each granddaughter excluded from their discovery examinations as they were virtually identical to the one conducted by the other parties. Finding that the evidence fell short of showing that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if these parties were not excluded, the court ordered costs to the estate."
7_1995canlii6153.txt,"The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault. He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident. He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant, who was the step-father of the plaintiff, commenced an action against the plaintiff claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. A. did not defend the action. The plaintiff alleged that A. had sexually assaulted her and her brother and had forced her to perform oral sex on him. The assaults continued for approximately eleven years. The mother, aware of the child's sexual abuse, had been forced to take medication for depression and became suicidal. The father's subsequent sentencing to 1 year in prison resulted in a 1 year term of imprisonment. Damages were assessed in the amount of $25,000. The Court reduced the award to $2500. The aggravated damage award was reduced to $40,000 and was not subject to any reduction. The wife was awarded judgment against A. in the sum of $65,000 togetherwith her taxable costs."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused indicated that the motor vehicle accident occurred when he was in a motor vehicle. He had participated in a driving without impairment program. HELD: 1) It was not necessary to assess the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the context of whether the evidence is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the accused had committed the offence as alleged. The Court was guided by the principles restated in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1996), 141 Sask. R. 221 (Sask. C.A.) (R. v.) (B.C.A.). 2) The accused should be able to rely on the procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. The information contained in the letter was not credible. The letter was neither credible nor convincing. 3) The evidence is not sufficient to prove the accused knowingly operated a motor car while disqualified as alleged and the accused is not guilty."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured, started an action against the defendant and the insurer of the plaintiff's vehicle, after her husband's vehicle was hit from behind by the vehicle that was being driven by the insured. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff had not shown any interest in claiming repayment of the monies paid to her under Schedule B of the Paris insurance policy until after the accident. The plaintiff alleged that the insurance company induced her to 'alter her position to her detriment' by continuing to accept the money. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to indicate any interest whatsoever in claiming repayments of the money paid under Schedule 'B' for the period 1993 to 1994, when the insurance policy was complied with. The court found that the defendant had acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the basis of the representations put forward by the plaintiff to the insurer and that the insurer had acted reasonably in responding to the plaintiff’s claim. The Court found that both the plaintiff and the insurance companies were acting reasonably in response to the employer’ s allegations and that both parties had been in receipt of the information as to employment at the time of the accident and that neither plaintiff nor the insurance carrier had been aware of the existence of these records when the accident occurred. The information was incorrect and the plaintiff did not have any employment. The nine weeks would not have qualified for unemployment in 1993 if the plaintiff was not employed. The plaintiffs claim against the insurancecompany was not supported by the information provided by the insurance agent. The defendants had not provided any employment documentation supporting the plaintiff."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who was a convicted child abuser, had been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of her conviction for child abuse. She had been in regular contact with the child since apprehension and had been better at keeping him from her own son, who lived with his maternal grandmother in Halifax. The father, who had been convicted of child abuse, had since been sentenced in a Nova Scotia court to thirty months in custody. He had the care of the child in an unsupervised situation. The mother, whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, had previously been sentencedto thirty-Nine months in penury in prison for the conviction. She was better situated to take care of her son, whom she had recently apprehended, and was more financially stable. Although the mother's relationship with the son had been tumultuous, the mother had always exercised proper parenting skills. Both parties strongly supported the mother having custody. An order of this court granting custody to the paternal grandmother was ordered to facilitate access to the various parties."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant appealed from the May 1999 probate decision dismissing his appeal of a previous order that the estate be paid into a bank account by the sole executor of the estate. The appellant had practised law for over 40 years before retirement and had made a number of controversial decisions, including one that required him to give evidence on his performance as a representative of the Church. The evidence had shown he had converted estate funds to his own use and that those actions had done a real disservice to the Church in which he had been appointed. The appeal alleged that the probate judge erred in: granting an order without first requiring proof of and making determination of whether the appellant was wasting the estate; failing that, failing to determine what was in the best interests of the Estate and directing the registrar to confiscate the appellant's estate file; in failing to find the improper investments on the part of the executor should stand up until the closing of the case and what interest rates would be proper against the executors in the circumstances; and in directing the Registrar to confiscat the appellant estate file.

The landlord states that he never agreed to pay the utilities.HELD: Pursuant to s. 72 of The residential Tenancies Act, the court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings. It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact.

The landlord argued the Hearing officer erred in his decision on the facts. HELD: The Court dismissed the appellant's findings of fact based on the law and the facts; there was no evidence the appellant had any independent findings of truth as to the appellant’s findings of facts. The Court reviewed the facts and found the appellant was not liable to pay any of the utilities and the Hearing Office had not agreed to accept some of the evidence of a particular witness and not other evidence of that witness.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was on salary, was unhappy about being asked to work less hours by her doctor and one of the reasons she was dismissed was because she was not able to qualify for special benefits due to her not having 600 hours of insurable employment. The plaintiff claims back $2,400 which was paid to repay expenses related to the defendant's bringing her daughter to Canada. The parties never spoke to each other about the money being paid back. The statements of claim dismissed. There is no evidence to support the allegation that the payments were not consented to and agreed to by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff filed the cheque, signed it and returned it, or that any of the defendants asked her to sign it. The statement of claim is dismissed. The Court finds that there was no loan of $1 million to the plaintiffs, as there was never a request to pay back the $1k000. The defendants had the free use of the plaintiff's home and the plaintiff gave the plaintiff his car whenever they needed it. There was no evidence presented as to why the plaintiff never asked the plaintiff to sign the cheques or signed them, but it was inferred that she did. The lawyer who represented the plaintiff states that she filed the check for $1 thousand and never received it. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court may hear evidence on the quantum of damages to be paid by the defendant to the applicant Lilia.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefit from Service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the applicant if she now qualifies for payment from Service C. 2) Lilia's claim was adjourned as there is no damages to her if she is unable to obtain the payments that she lost. If she is not able, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the amount of damage to be borne by the respondent to the respondent Lilia in relation to the litigation between the parties.  3) There is actually no loan given to the applicants as far as the $2k000 is concerned.

4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) This is a three-step process. The court must determine whether the parent is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The parents never lived together. The father is currently unemployed. 2) The parties' income is below the amount normally required for Table support. 3) The father has three other children from two different mothers. His current income is above the amount usually required for a Table support order. 4) The court cannot impute income to the father on the basis he is intentionally over-employed. The onus is on the father to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. The facts do not support the imputed income."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (Reg.10)'. The Crown tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The police officer issued a certificate of offence. voluntary payment option of $105 was provided in the certificate of offense. The self-represented appellant did not advance the issue of the charge, as framed, being a nullity. Instead, he sent an agent to appear on the Court's behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The officer then tendered the evidence of prior convictions for a similar type of offense with the vehicle and requested a fine. The traffic justice awarded $350 plus surcharge. The appellant did exercise the voluntary payment Option and did not appear for trial on that day. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The Court found that the count, as drafted, is a nullius and is not capable of fixing the defect. It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect, as the charge is so palpably bad it does not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the offence nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established.

The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgement or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The respondent's application is dismissed in light of the below-table standard of review. 2) The judgment speaks from the time it is pronounced. What the parties had in their minds, or what they believed they were negotiating, is irrelevant to the analysis. 3) The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order."

Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident.

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Hartford sought to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible for the fire loss. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian was therefore not liable. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire nor that the obligation to insure the risk had been fixed by the terms of the policy issued to the Province; as Delta did not cause the fire it had no liability to the province or Fraser- Brace for causing the fire, and was not at risk for the loss as there wasno allocation of the fire risk to Delta by the contract documents; there were no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer; the Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. In this case it never did. On these facts Guardian had no obligation to respond to under the terms the policy of the insurance issued to Delta. Furthermore, as Delta was never 'never at risk' for fire loss to the provincial's property it had absolutely no liability for the Fire Loss."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana plants contrary to s.(6) of that Act. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed the accused standing at the rear of the van. He approached the accused and asked if there were any problems with the vehicle, asked if he wanted to empty his pockets, and then asked if the accused was going to call lawyer. The accused testified he did not require a warrant as he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he had been asked to. He also testified he had not seen any officers working in the detachment that day. He testified he was given an opportunity to call a lawyer but he was not able to do so. He was put in the back of the patrol car and was arrested. The Crown did not offer any evidence as to what the lawyer thought of asking the question 'what is in back of van?' Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter: 1) Was there an arbitrary detention contrary to the Charter; 2) Was the search unreasonable as it was not authorized by law; 3) Was it reasonable to ask questions which were not questions of a reasonable and reasonable basis and were not results of an unreasonable search; 4) Counsel argued the search itself began when the officer pulled up to the rental van in an investigative mode. The police officer became suspicious because the accused wasn't taking the most direct route to his home; and 5) Counsel raised these issues as an issue of continuity of evidence. Counsel argued there was no argument advanced that the Crown stipulated it was excluding evidence of the drug plants from the vehicle. The defence argued the Crown did have reasonable and good grounds to exclude the evidence from the van and that once the accused had gone to the driver's seat to relieve himself, he could not refuse to supply the accused with anything of substance. The voir-dire was concluded that the conversation between the accused, the officer and the driver was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case that there was reasonable and likely cause for warrantless inspection. The Court concluded the accused's detention was arbitrary and constituted an arbitrary detentions contrary to ss. 10(b) and 10(c).

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury.

The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to ss. 151 of the Criminal Code. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Court found that the accused had not believed the complainant's testimony and that she did not wish to be seen by the public. The complainant did not have any problems with the accused. The evidence of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom was also found to be unreliable. The court gave the accused credit for 22:9.5 of the trial. The judge was required to instruct the jury that they need not firmly believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses and that this is desirable development. The Crown did not revoke the assumption formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children's evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for the filing of returns by way of a Form D with respect to goods and services. The Form D contains a facsimile signature of the Director-Taxation. The Court found that the Director had not filed the returns nor did he appear to have consented to the return. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. 2)The Interpretation Act does nothing to override an explicit statutory or regulatory delegation of authority. It operates in the general scheme of things and incorporates the common law doctrine as enunciated in R. v. Harrison. 3)The service of a demand to file a return upon a business operation in the City of Regina is clearly an appropriate act to be performed by the Director. The execution and serving of such a demand is purely an administrative act. It does not require the exercise of a Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of his or her rights by restricting any right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. 4)There was no error by the trial judge in setting aside the revocation of the order. The appellants had not sought to attach any weight to the fact that the return had not been filed. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances.
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. The issues raised in the statements of defence were not susceptible of being simply resolved, and neither did the issues in the counter-claimed statement of Defence show a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The defendants had registered a mortgage against a condominium unit number 14 and thus, qualified to make a claim for unpaid assessments. The plaintiff asserted that the sufficiency of the pleadings did not disclose a reasonable defence nor did the issue in the defence show areasonable cause of actions. 2)The Court had jurisdiction to inquire into the adequacy of the solicitor-client privilege."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The accused brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: The application for change of venues was denied. 1)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. 2)The evidence showed that there was a reasonably serene environment in Saskatoon, despite the fact that there were several memorials to the victim at the site and several reminders of his name on social media. 3)Despite the fact the accused may have some preconceptions about the victim, the Court was satisfied that a properly instructed jury would be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the victim would receive a fair trial."

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence.

He argues the Rules gave the judge discretion to grant the amendment; and that the judge should have granted it. Appeal allowed; the judge's order dismissing the application should be set aside; the appellant can renew the application in the Supreme Court if it so chooses. The issue is whether the Rules give the judge a discretion to make amendments. In this case, the limitation period has intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant has prejudiced the defendant's defence."

The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code.

4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired (I.D.) and was charged for impaired driving. The accused applied for a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count and an order that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an agreement that the defence be allowed in the cross-examination of the Crown witness. The Crown had not disclosed the contents of the original Checksheet. HELD: The officer was not aware that the accused's speech was slurred when he read the Checksheets. He would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the speech wasurred slurred speech. The remainder of the Checksheet was never found to contain the correct information. The information was never returned to the accused. The Court found that the failure in disclosure was not a breach of the accused s.7 Charter rights but rather a breach which could have been remedied through a probity trial."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The Chambers judge did not err in law in determining that there was no abuse of processes. The jurisdiction to hear the appeal was determined in the Court's general jurisdiction under s. 24 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and on the basis that the Chambers judge’s decision was based on the same principles as that of abuse ofprocess and was not an abuseof process. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the jurisdiction to decide the appeal of this appeal could not be found in the court’S general jurisdiction or in the inherent scope of the court. The Court’d jurisdiction was limited by the provisions of s. 25(1)(a) and s. 26 of The Courts of Appeal act, 2000. The chambers judge did however depart from the standard of review and depart from her usual practice of reviewing cases and applying the same criteria as the one in Moritz v. Moritz.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.

The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the chambers judge in this instance.

The only other claimant who had been asked to regard the action as a test case were the hundreds of other claimants who had already been asked by management pre-trial judge to regard their claim as a matter of the best interest of their claims. HELD: The order of severance sought was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to trial without delay. The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by the counsel for the Canada government if the issues are severed are groundless. The plaintiff was stalling in the pursuit of resolution of the issues. He had been subjected to lengthy litigation which would result in the expenditure of time on the litigation.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence led to the conclusion that the respondent had not intended to assault his wife but rather to strike her. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence was so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence. The court found that the defence of intoxication was not available to the respondent because it was not limited to cases of extreme drunkenness. The trial judge therefore failed to properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as a result of the appellant's degree of intoxication, that there was clearly an assault."

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the Chambers court also included child maintenance issues. The father argues that the Chambers judges erred by finding the children's wishes to be irrelevant. The parties requested a viva voce hearing on the basis that the material was too controverted to allow a decision to be made on affidavit evidence alone. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a maximum contact principle alone for a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. 2) The evidence regarding the childrens wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the Chambers Judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed. The Chambers Judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in circumstances but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the children’s needs and needs. This was an error by the Chambers Court in that it gave too much weight to irrelevant considerations, controverted affidavit evidence, inadmissible evidence and short term matters which did not have direct application to the children. 3) The Court found that the evidentiary threshold necessary to make decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence had been reached. The chambers judge did not err in her approach in crafting the decision. The Court of Appeal was unable to intervene in this matter solely because of the error of law."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in 1996. The trustee of the estate never applied for discharge. HELD: The order of the court was granted. However, the issue remained unresolved as of 13 years later. The respondent had not applied for a discharge and the applicant had received an order for costs. The order for the costs was granted in respect of the respondent's application for discharge and although nonexempt equity did not exist at the time of the application for the discharge, it was evidenced that the trustee was transmitting an 82% interest in the real property to the trustee's name. That transaction was completed in 1996 and the respondent had some idea of what the realizable value of the property might have been in 1996 although there is no indication of how the potential sale price was arrived at."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also apply for orders require the third parties TO provide further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: 1) The discovery process is a complex one and the plaintiff must be prepared to deal with it in a fashion that suits the purposes of the Act. 2) The third parties are required to provide proper documentation of the transactions to the plaintiff and to provide appropriate documentation to the court on the issues in issue. 3) The plaintiff is entitled to rely upon the evidence of third parties in the exploration and development of his or her property. The parties in this action are contractors to drill oil and gas wells and are subject to various tax credits. The tax credits are not included in the contracts. The contracts between the plaintiff, the third party contractors and the third-party vendors all contain specific references to the provisions that are considered ambiguous in terms of the question of whether there is a separate sale of taxable personal property. 4) The parties have disclosed certain PSAC documents in their possession relating to the Saskatchewan PST issue. The plaintiff seeks judgment against the defendant for the amount paid. 5) The transport and communications between third parties and the plaintiffs is a major source of information for the plaintiff. The transport industry typically characterizes these relationships as that of a third party claimant. The third party vendors are typically vendors to the parties for materials and services. The transportation industry typicallycharacterizes these commercial relationships in a manner consistent with that articulated in the following federal court cases: Halliburton Services Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter (sub-district) and Trican (sub sub-distinctive) Ltd. (the 'Trican') Ltd. Ltd. and the 'BJ Services' Ltd. LTD (the ""BJ"") Ltd. These third parties have various positions on various matters. During the course of the claim the plaintiff conducted examinations for the purpose of extracting information from third parties. During this period the plaintiff obtained information that led to the creation of the PST Act. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that, if necessary, he can be further examined on the responses.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The common characteristics of a fiducary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood and the fact that each doctor was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it. On the facts, the relationship was entirely voluntary. 2)The fact that the plaintiff failed to give evidence as to the nature of the relationship could have resulted in a breach of the statutory and contractual obligations to him or herself caused the plaintiff to take his position as hospital administrator with the Court to be totally disinterested. 3)The court dismissed the action against the doctors with costs."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.",The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of the police officer who at the time was an inmate. The accused's testimony was that he had been advised by the doctor that the drinking was okay. The officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to get blood and he signed the second certificate. The doctor testified that the officer did not notice that the second Certificate was signed at the doctor's home. HELD: The Court held that the facts in the mind of the officer at the moment of the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. The Court found that the medical practitioner had no real recollection either of who actually took the blood or of signing the second Cert. and that he clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that the taking of the blood for law enforcement purposes would not endanger the life or health of his patient. The evidence was found to be reasonable and likely grounds for the Crown's conclusion that the accused had acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life and health of the victim. The Certificate was not a valid proof of the facts as determined by the Court.
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him that the officer had not made forthwith an ASD demand and that he was being arbitrarily detained. The accused sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The Court held that the Charter breaches were moderately serious and the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The officer appeared to have acted in good faith. The Court found that the accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes until a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared in goodfaith. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. The court found that once the accused is detained for an unreasonable period of time and the ASD results are not madeforthwith, his s. 9 Charter rights are not infringered. The defence argued that the delay of 11 minutes was largely due to the unavailability of the ASD. The Defence argued that once a breath sample is given to the accused, the accused should have been given an opportunity to contact counsel. The police did not ask the accused if he had been in an accident, nor did he ask whether a roadside sample was taken, nor asked him if he was okay with that. The certificate of analysis was admitted in evidence."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended. The adjudicator found the appellant's evidence to be more credible than the Crown's and three other witnesses testified to it. The appellant also appealed his convictions for mischief, arguing that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, or to make findings of credibility based on the evidence of the Crown witnesses. Appeal allowed; conviction stayed; new trial ordered. The trial judge should have made clear findings of credible based on his evidence. The evidence before the adjudicating judge was clearly capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The decision of the adjudicate was not based on a failure to address this issue but rather on the independent evidence of three witnesses who testified they had seen the appellant get out of the driver's side of the vehicle and rush into the service station; the adjudicators' analysis was not constructive or convincing."

The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs. The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned. The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in their possession of the proposed appellant but claimed by the proposed appellant.

The appellants sought leave to appeal. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. While the wording of the Rules may be vexing to some, they are not sufficient to cause a judge to unnecessarily delay the Court's proceeding. While they may have the effect of setting off a relatively short-lived litigant's action, they do not raise a significant issue of the Court as they do in this case. While a ruling of this nature could be of considerable importance to a Court of Appeal decision, it is not of sufficient significance to immediately adjourn the Court to this matter."

HELD: (1)Application dismissed. The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge. In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,"FIAT. At a preliminary hearing, the Provincial Court judge made a decision committing a police officer to stand trial on a charge of defamation against a police Officer contrary to ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code and an application was made by the applicant for an order quashing certain conditions of a recognizance issued at the preliminary hearing on February 8, 1994, which conditions included that the judge receive full disclosure with respect to the defamation charge and that his complaint is with respectto an ongoing investigation of another potential offence. In the preliminary, there was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either the judge was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias. As to the complaint about disclosure, the application appeared to be made with respect only to an ongoing criminal investigation.

The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and one count of breaching a peace officer’s undertaking by unlawfully assaulting a police officer. The Court determined that the accused was properly identified and acting as a police Officer in the line of duty. The offences were aggravated assaults. The court found that the defence of self-defence was not available on the accused on the count of breaking a police officers’ (head) ornaments or anything to that effect. The accused was at large on his or her employment in the RCMP and had a residence in the city. The complainant was in the street and was assaulted by the accused when he exited the vehicle. The assault was violent and took place over an extended period of time. The vehicle was locked up and the accused assaulted the complainant. The officer testified that he had to physically remove the accused from the vehicle because the accused had not stopped his assault immediately. The Crown indicated that it was not a defence of the self- defence available to the accused. The evidence showed that the complainant had not locked the door when the assault started and he remained in the vehicle until the final moment of the assault. The police officer testified at the trial that he was concerned about the possibility of alcohol use by the driver of the vehicle in question. The male accused was charged with aggravated assault on the female complainant.

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff was subjected to what was described as 'elder abuse' and was being financially taken off by a third party. A review panel provided for in the Mentally Disordered Persons Act (MDPA) had asked the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist. The psychiatrist who had conducted the examination was found incompetent. The Public Trustee, which was under the MDPA, brought an application for judicial review. The applicant brought this application on the basis the competency examination was obtained by the subterfuge of asking the plaintiff if he was mentally competent to attend a medical examination in connection with a pension application he had made some time earlier and then administering to him a mental competency exam. The judge concluded that if the plaintiff was subsequently found to be incompetent and the action was discontinued, or the defendants were successful in their defence, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs against the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that it would be inappropriate to order a single examination for a determination of a mental competence issue where it would appear that there was no acceptable medical evidence on the issue. The Act, which provides for a single diagnosis and treatment, provides for an independent medical exam and an assessment of mental competence. The Court was not aware of any law that suggested costs should be considered in the context of a civil suit. The application is dismissed."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced a class action in Saskatchewan in 2006. The defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay the action pending review by Queen's Bench Rule 173. The applicants sought the same discretionary order as the Court of Appeal in Englund, reversing the trial court decision, ordering a conditional stay of the action. HELD: The Court of appeal in Englert is the court's parent jurisdiction and the jurisdiction is now 'no costs' jurisdiction providing for the certification of a national multi-jurisdictional class action on an 'opt out' basis. The Court acknowledges that the current state of the law in Saskatchewan and in other jurisdictions may prompt the Court's to consider the application in a preliminary application. However, the Court is not inclined to engage in an exploration of the general approach which Saskatchewan courts should take in the face of typical overlapping multi- jurisdictional class actions. The application in this case is intended to respond to and take advantage of recent amendments to the Act. The Act provides for the establishment of a 'no cost' jurisdiction in which the Court can certify a class on anopt out basis."

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent also sought custody, custody, divorce with payment for extraordinary expenses and an ordered that the petitioner's equity be postponed while she was working and/or obtained a new home. The husband counter-petitioned for child support, child care expenses and a division of matrimononial assets. HELD: The petitioner was to have primary care of the children, with the exception of one child, with access to the matron home when the youngest one is 21 years old and the husband's current medical plan does not cover orthodontic treatments. The child support payments were to be paid from the Maintenance Enforcement Program. The wife's request to have the husband postpone the child support payment for orthodONTIC treatment was not granted as it would cause her to lose the child's future income. The father's equity was to be retained by the Trust Fund for the purpose of managing the children's future needs and the balance of the matrionial home was to solely be held by the Fund. The mother's request for a reduction in the value of the husband’s equity in that home was also refused as it was a rental property. The court ordered that if the husband could not pay the mortgage and the value in the home was reduced by more than $100,000, the Trust fund would be required to pay the balance to the husband and it would be impossible for him to contribute proportionately. The parties’ relationship was already strained and it was important to maintain a semblance of normalcy in the marriage."

If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial. 2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event. 3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code.

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. Costs in the cause. Whether the plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation could not be resolved in the absence of cross-examination.","FIAT. The plaintiff claims his creditor wrongfully converted monies after full and final settlement of his account was agreed upon. In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant's 'high-handed and malicious behavior'. The plaintiff assigned to the defendant future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments but agreed to settle the debt for a lesser sum. The defendant alleges its creditor induced the plaintiff to settle by false representation that 1. Saskatchewan Government Insurance was suing him for between $250,000 and $300,000; 2. That the plaintiff would be liable for damages in the range of $250 to $300 for an uninsured vehicle and that he would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy rendering the defendant account uncollectible. The claim for indemnification against the plaintiff was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. Costs in the cause. Accepting the plaintiff's application for summary judgment and ordering a summary trial, that there must be an operative misrepresentation regarding a matter of fact. The fundamental tension in the evidence is on the issue of misrepresentation. The subtleties involved in making the distinction between whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed and whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. One way that contradictory evidence can be resolved in the absent of cross examination is where for the purposes of the application the court accepts the defendant’s evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. The court would not normally issue summary judgment unless it was otherwise unjust to doing so. The test set out in Caudle v. Louisville Sales Service (1999) was not raised. It was not intended to be a test of whether there was contradictory evidence but rather a way to decide whether a contradictory evidence could be resolved by the absenceof cross- examination. The portion of the statement that he said he would be personally responsible for all damages as the owner of an uninsured car and that his remaining remarks that he was likely to make an Assignment in bankruptcy rendered the defendant\'s account unCollectible were merely prognostic, or mere statement of opinion."
9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, female and child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that the middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to s 155 of the Code and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA samples from both the male and female are premature. A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised that it is so advised. The information contained in the Informations In Support is not the relationship to the parties of the named informant, nor is the information provided by the informant considered reliable. The maiden name of the 19- year old woman as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is different than the surname of the natural mother. While it is literally true that the naturalmother's blood sample has been obtained from 'within' her body, it is my view that it cannot reasonably be argued that this blood sample is 'associated with' the commission of an offence. The baby is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant to ss. 486.07 of the code. The DNA sample is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby. While there may be an appropriate DNA sample (such as a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 18 year old) but it is questionable whether it could be concluded that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. The natural mother is obviously in no position to offer an informed or other assistance, except in the form of an informed informed consent. The blood sample of the pregnant woman as shown on the registration of Live birth is of no probative value as it is not linking in any manner to the actual father. There is nothing from the natural Mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the 17 year old female. The same may be said with respect with respect the contents of three Informations (Supplementary Information and Other Informations).

e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.

The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.

The board of arbitration made a determination that there was a violation of academic freedom which didnot involve parties of the collective Agreement.

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada. The Bank's application is brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Court finds that the Bank's priority to the leased equipment is not the number or frequency of the leases that determines the application of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The issue is which of the two companies has priority to or entitlement to the equipment subject to the Lease. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the PCSA and it required registration.

The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. The wife moved with the children in 2011, notwithstanding an existing order. That move was reversed in January 2012. The petitioner now resides in Kenaston. The Court ordered that the children have regular telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until the father is released from custody. The court is of the view that the issues are resolved in the father's favour. 1) Even on an interim basis the court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's best interests. This is not a balancing act; rather, it is a fresh consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the needs of the children, and the ability of each parent to satisfy those needs. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. The parents should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime, or one of the other means of electronic audio/visual communication. The respondent harbours suspicions that she and the children actually moved here. When the father was sentenced in October 2012, he was eligible for early release in December 2013. There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in his favour.  2) Even if the mother's move with the child to Kenaston was allowed on an intermittent basis the Court has insufficient evidence to conclude that the two young children would benefit. There must be some a connection maintained, that can be achieved through telephone, that is, through Skype access, but not with an internet connection. Some form of monitoring might be possible. The children should explore the prospect for communication with corrections officials if the move proceeds. If the father has to get out of jail, he will not have had close ties to the children for the foreseeable future. This defies common sense."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","The applicant sought to have her license suspended for two years. The applicant applied for a third ground of appeal, arguing that the decision of the commission was arbitrary and contrary to the principles of natural justice resulting in denial of the principles for fairness. Application dismissed; the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the false lease and the failure to remit rent resolved primarily by their finding on the appellant's credibility; the absence of any explanation for the other allegations; the length of time between hearing evidence and submission; the imposition of sanctions and the repayment of the written costs; the applicant's failure to comply with the terms of the regulation and the time it took to reach the decision; the application for a three-year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08 were dismissed. The application for an appeal of the Commission's decision on all five allegations was dismissed."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor. The club was located in an area of the municipality which was subject to the respondent's Land Use By-laws. The development officer at the time determined that the club would be a 'lounge' or 'queen' within the restricted use of the permitted uses, and a development agreement was entered whereby the permitted use would be for the use of members of the club only and not the general public. Although the applicant had received a development permit from the Province of Nova Scotia, it had a liquor license from the City of Toronto which prohibited the sale or use of alcohol on the premises. The application for a development license was dismissed. The Board of Appeal held that the applicant's application for the change in the liquor license would not have the effect it sought as it would be contrary to the character of the land and would violate the Municipality's Landuse By-law. As the applicant intended to serve its members and provide entertainment, the zoning and building codes in the municipality did not impede its right to make that application. The zoning and development agreement were both reviewed by the Board of Appeals. The court found that the application for an order to declare that the respondent land use policy was fundamentally different from the one it had previously contemplated and that the change would adversely affect the adjacent properties. The board ordered that the liquor licensing be changed to a development authorization for the applicant. The Municipality appealed the decision of the development officer confirming that the zoning change did not adversely affect their landowner rights. Appeal allowed on this appeal. The appeal court found the following about the application: 1) the remoteness and neighbourhood effects of the modern regime of land use controls have a role to play in the proper disposition of this type of case. 2) In attempting to accommodate the landowner's real and natural expectation of the continuation of the status quo, and to properly maintain the balance between the interests of the landlord and the community, the court should also have these 'neighbourhood effects' in mind. The fact that initially the development officers considered the present use of a club to be a non-conforming use and then issued a development order confirming that development agreement would result in a development permission for the establishment; 3) the applicant may only appeal refusal to issue a development licence on the grounds that the decision is not in conformity with"
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. The Court held that once ITI decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those very materials to the students. He found that ITI had selected the books in issue and therefore the books delivered to ITI were subject subject to that agreement for Sale to the student. The court also found that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement for sales within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate claims against the plaintiffs, one of which was for wrongful dismiss. The second claim, inducing breachof contract, was brought against the defendant. HELD: The Court granted the application on the basis of the immaterial and not-delegant pleadings made by the defendants in relation to the plaintiff's action concerning his health and well-being. The Court found that the pleadings were not relevant as they were not mere allegations and did not serve as evidence as to why the defendants' positions were changed. The pleadings and the attached paragraphs were not intended to be part of the plaintiff’s defence and were merely the pleadments.

c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions and child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines and in the amount of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses. Prior to the 2009 consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the father for increased child maintenance but had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. The mother now applied for a retroactive award of retroactive child support. HELD: The order was granted. The court found that the father had 'effective notice' that his child support was deficient and that the mother had 'directed' him to make further contributions. The Court found that given the father's dramatic increase in salary and the fact that he had not shown any improvement in his income in the years prior to the separation, there had to be a reasonable reason for delay in the application. The Father had'sufficient notice' of the retroactive order. The retroactive amount was ordered retroactive to the date of the father’s separation. The current father was in arrears with regard to child maintenance payments."

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The Court held that the exhibits were not entitled to be admitted into the courtroom. The Court found that the accused had not consented to the discovery of the exhibits and that the Court found them to be inadmissible. The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of search of the accused's computer and cellular phone. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined until after the trial. The trial resumed and the accused applied for exclusion of certain evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The application to exclude items of the complainant's computer contained no such evidence as was alleged in the affidavit. The search for child pornography was abandoned immediately after the court gave the statement. The court found that, considering the accused’s background and the circumstances surrounding the discovery, there was no evidence that they had asked the officer for the information which they had obtained in the search. The evidence was abandoned right from the start of the search and the Court concluded that the search was to obtain and obtain child pornography. The purpose of the warrant was not to obtain child pornographic images but to search for and obtain evidence of the alleged child pornography on the accused computer. The officer was qualified as an expert in the field of forensic computer and computer device examination, peer to peer file sharing software and computer devices applications. His evidence was based on the testimony of a witness who testified that she had seen the accused take pictures of her in the shower. The complainant did not provide this evidence when she testified at the preliminary inquiry. HELD: On a balance of probabilities, the Court determined that the evidence obtained in this investigation would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The following is the judgment: 1) The Court considered that the officer was entitled to know what the complainant’d said in the statement, but did not ask him to look for pictures of the person. The same information was not included in the warrant. The very reason for obtaining the warrant is abandoned right before the startof the search; 2) The court was able to conclude all of the images were child pornography, but that the images did not appear to be part of the evidence before the court. The third factor to be weighed is the effect of the breach on the Charter-protected privacy interests of the parties. The findings of this investigation are significant because they show that the police intended to search only for the search of images of the'search on the computer.' The Court"

He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers or their maintenance. He suffered a finger injury when the nozzle of the paint sprayers plugged and the paint and solvent dribbled out. He was rushed to hospital where surgical procedures were performed to clean and stop the progress of the foreign substance. He sued the defendant for the loss of his finger. At issue was the defendant's liability for the non-pecuniary damage issue. The plaintiff argued that the defendant was duty bound to provide warning to renters, but did not. The defendant argued that warning was unnecessary because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for a further six years to allow inflation to intervene. The non-credible damage issue was assessed at $10,000. The court found that the plaintiff should have taken more time to learn how to properly apply the spray, and that he had a duty to mitigate his loss. The claim for loss of income, past and future was assessed as $5,000, plus costs and pre-judgment interest."

The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.

The tenant reluctantly accepted the termination date and thereafter applied under the Act for the return of their security deposit and other damages.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 having regard the operation s. 29(1)(the Credit Union), and s.(30(2)) of the Personal Property Protection Security Act (PPSA) having regard as between the parties. The issue is whether the security holder, the respondent, authorized the sale of the mobile home as contemplated by s.28(1), or if he was not authorized, did he sell the mobilehome in the ordinary course of business as contemplated s.30(1).

With respect to the facts, the appellant was in error. Section 28(2)(a) contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to dealwith the security. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal With the collateral. The fundamental question is whether, if the authorize is subject subject to payment in part.

9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing and thereby interfering with the plaintiff's lawful use of the premises and with the lawful use and improvement of the site. The defendants each submitted that they were not engaged in secondary pickingeting and were merely engaging in lawful picketing. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was granted an order for service and return of the notice of motion. 2)The injunction was granted on the ground that the picketers had disrupted the entrances of the plaintiff and its employees by swinging a wooden picket sign at vehicles attempting to enter and exit the plaintiff premises and by placing their picket signs over the windshield. 3)The court found that the acts complained of were illegal and were illegal. 4)The Court restrained the defendants on the basis that the condemnations of the secondary picketing as being illegal were based upon the inclusion in the picketing of extrinsic unlawful elements. 5)The delay in the plaintiff obtaining materials was caused by the picket line. 6)The plaintiffs' rights were restrained. 7)The respondent's right to trade was infringed. 8)The right to refuse to supply or to rent services was infringred. 9)The balance of convenience was lost when the picketer struck the plaintiff vehicle. 10)The respondents were given leave to file materials. 11)The affidavits were not filed. 12)The parties were given time to reply to the affidavits. 13)The affidavit was not filed but was merely a response to a written notice. 14)The adjournment was granted in respect of the unlawful picketing which occurred near the plaintiff employees entrance. 15)The defendants were given 30 days to reply. 16)The application was allowed on the condition that the plaintiff file materials and the adjournment be granted on their behalf. 17)The issues were decided in respect to the injunction and the equitable distribution of the relief.
5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, a stolen motor vehicle, cocaine. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused refused to withdraw his clothing and rearranged his outer clothing to permit a closer inspection. There was no physical contact by officers to the accused on the basis of asking questions. The officer who conducted the strip search was not aware that the vehicle was being searched for drugs. The complainant was not made aware of the substance of the drugs until the very last second. The search was relatively quick and minimally invasive. The evidence sought to be excluded was 17.8 grams of crack cocaine. Although significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person, the Court found that the strip-search was specifically related to the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest and was not, as it seemed, related to any of the reasons for the arrest itself. The Court found significant efforts made to preserve the integrity of this young person and to ensure his access to counsel and/or the Court's Access to Information. The strip search, conducted for the purpose of preserving evidence, was not intrusive and was entirely unrelated to the reasons behind the arrest. The Act requires that all persons with a legal or moral record be privy to the search. The law prohibits strip searches in the context of a criminal proceeding. The court found that significant efforts had been made to protect the privacy of this person and that the evidence would be part of the trial proper. The trial judge found that although significant efforts have been made in the search to preserve evidence, the search was specifically focused on the totality surrounding the arrests and was incident to arrest."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused, who was related to the complainant, was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent. Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rea. If the activity were consensual, there was nothing to consent to. If not, the accused lacked the mens for sexual assault. The evidence of the accused's daughter and the accused being in a good mood at the time of the activity raised reasonable doubt about the complainant's non-consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not been drinking and that she was capable of consenting."

The defendants applied to have the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction or to havethe action stayed on the basis of forum non conveniens. The action was to be tried in Nova Scotia. The plaintiff had chosen the appropriate forum as he recognized that he would suffer loss in loss in attempting to obtain the evidence in Wisconsin and elsewhere in the United States to substantiate his allegations and to import that evidence to Nova Scotia, on the grounds that there was a real and substantial connection between the ultimate event and this action.

5_1997canlii866.txt,"The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic. The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left. On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants for negligent driving. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also brought an assault action against her employer, alleging that the nurse was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The employer refused to admit the nurse as a party. The female plaintiff also testified at trial about the difficulty of driving after an abortion, noting that she had been advised to take sedative for pain, fatigue and damage from the previous procedure. At trial, the judge directed that any order of judgment not mention the nurse's name. The court found that the driving issue was important to the nurse because it would affect her ability to care for her children and the fact that she might need to take medication for a few days after the procedure. The automobile accident was particularly hard on the female plaintiff because of the high speed limit and the difficulty in finding parking. The nurses had to take extra time to get to the clinic. At the clinic, the plaintiff was given sedative to ease her anxiety and to allow her to take the sedative when she was driving home. The Court awarded the $115,000 damages to the first plaintiff for the loss of the baby and $55,000 on the second plaintiff for motor vehicle accident. The second plaintiff was awarded $115 in general damages for failure to obey a written warning and for failing to observe the signs of impairment. The third plaintiff was found to be at fault for the delay in the assessment of damages."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, the Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorkdal. The appellant contended that Justice Rothery had erred in granting the motion to withdrew the case. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Bjorksdale Lions club with the assistance of the BjORKdale Fire Department. The respondent suffered burns to various parts of his body. His right hand and arm were badly burned. He was helped to the ground by a flagman who noticed the splash of liquid or gasoline in the interior of the vehicle. Having come to stop the vehicle it was found to have been struck by the flames. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. The damage could not be seen to have caused or been caused or contributed to by the respondents. 2)The appellant took the position that he had made a prima facie case of liability against each of the defendants based on their having breached their respective duties of care and having caused or caused or contribute to his injury. Alternatively, he contended that she had erered in her award of costs. The parties agree that the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the standard of care required of persons in the organization and conduct of demolition derbys, nor any expert evidence of that standard of caring required of each of them. The issue reduces to whether she applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. The evidence adducing by the appellants may be taken for the purposes at hand to establish the following, though it may be noted that there were a number of inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence: The fault or no fault of the respondent for failing to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the damage could have been caused by the defendants and not been caused to by by the Respondents. 3)The appeal was dismissed to the fullest extent."
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","HELD: The application was granted. The court held that it would disregard the content of the applicant’s affidavit as it was not intended to be a declaration of compliance. The application could not be brought on a party to a party convention or on a general meeting of the members of the Condominium Corporation. As there were only seven positions on the Board, the board was composed of seven members.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. He was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted of the same offence, but with a limited criminal record. The accused had stopped selling the drug in a community park, where many young people gather for social events. The park is the most popular gathering place for older children and adolescents. The Court found that the accused was cruising around in his vehicle with the cocaine in the back. The court sentenced the accused to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The offender was only 1 month into his probation order when he was arrested for possession for purposes of the trafficking cocaine, and had only a probation violation. The Crown had indicated that the trafficking was likely to be violent, and the accused would benefit from any more time in actual custody. The sentencing judge placed the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The amount of cocaine that the youth had possessed was significant and the fact that he was cruising in his car with the drug was enough to make it clear that the crime was being committed in a public place. The aggravating factors were the accused's youth record, the fact he had stopped drinking alcohol, the presence of drugs in his community park and his failure to pay attention to the fact the accused had a criminal record that included possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The youth was only 21 years old at the time of his conviction and had a record of 39 convictions. The criminal record had not been considered aggravating in the circumstances."

The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The respondents entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with respect to land legally described as 'the land.' The respondents had a fire in 1995 and the fire had destroyed their building. The landlords had insured against loss of business for 40 years. The 1995 fire was deemed fit for business and the owners insured against Loss for 40.5 years. A fire insured against the whole lease until a cause was made known. The owners were ordered to insure the whole property against fire and insurance for 40 year. Hail damage claims in excess of $1,000 were made in 1998. The defendants were ordered into possession of the land. A writ of possess was ordered against the landlord in accordance with Form C of the Act. Where there were questions of fact or law the matter should not be decided summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and a debilitating leg injury. He sought to have the Court review his obligation pursuant to s15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone such as income levels or self-sufficiency. HELD: 1)It was significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousals were either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the spousaling order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have his obligation reviewed by the Court reviewed his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. There is no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It is evident that the applicant has retired and has no intention to become re-employed. It's essential that the parties know now how their future financial situations will be. 3)Spousal Support should be varied according to the needs and means of the Parties. The Court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of the spouse support order set out in s15(2)(2nd Supp.) rather than focussing on one factors alone, such as Income levels or Self-sufffficiency. There are two flaws in the applicant's submissions. The first is that there is significant tax saving to the applicant respecting payments he makes for spousa support. It does not evident from the material that either he or his planner have adequately taken this into account. The second is that the respondent could increase her monthly income by taking in boarders or selling her home and purchasing some form of annuity. The court must give consideration to the present situation. The application of these legal principles does not warrant termination of the applicant’s spousousal obligations to the respondent but it is beyond dispute that the applicants have focused on future projections, not on established fact. An adjustment period is called for in the circumstances."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. Her costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes. 2) The expert medical evidence introduced by the plaintiff could not be found on either side of the Atlantic. The costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 3) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file medical practitioners' reports without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters. 4) Expert medical evidence expenses were reasonable; the witness testimony contribution to the case and relevant to the issues was not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.(i)Professions filed by a party who obtained leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the court is heard. 5) The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. The amount of time between many of the expert medical witnesses was not reduced by 50 percent. 6) Costs payable by the defendant on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs. 7) The medical report charge was not allowed. 8) The costs are equitable.

The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search was conducted in the area of the accused's residence and was subject to numerous conditions, including that he not be subject to search by RCMP or British Columbia police. The documents seized were of sufficient quality to support the validity of the warrants. HELD: The Court found that both the warrants were valid and that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omissions involved. The Court excluded the evidence of the Crown's failure to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The evidence of all the other offences was properly addressed by the issuing Justice in Saskatchewan and the Endorsing Justice in British Columbia. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his trial pursuant to ss. 24(2) and 24(3) of the Charter. The Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid the Crown would have to substantially comply with the requirements of the law, in particular, s.4857 of the Criminal Code and s./11 CDSA, and the Form of the code. Hearsay: The evidence satisfies the Court that there is no bad evidence, malice, or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrant. The accused was acquitted of all charges. The court found that the Crown had not proven that the warrants as issued were invalid. The Order of the Chief issued pursuant the voir dire did not refer to the s.476(1)(c) warrant nor did it state that the search was authorized by law. The order of the issuing justice was based upon the endorsement of the respondent in the Provincial Court of Appeal. The endorsement was clearly appropriate. The affidavit submitted by the respondent was not supported by the evidence. The Certificate of Disclosure was not accepted."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused, who was charged with sexual assault and pre-sentence report, applied to set aside his guilty plea to count 1, the sexual assault of his son. The charge was based on allegations made against the accused in a pre-trial communications. The evidence showed that the accused, by his plea of guilty, did not accept the Crown version of the incident upon which the charge was alleged, and that he did not want to spare his son by showing his penis to his lawyer. The accused also claimed that he told his lawyer that he had asked the accused to show his son how to clean his penis as a condition of his plea to the charge. The lawyer testified that he was not aware of the allegations, but that he believed the accused had said so. Application dismissed. The test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the accused's application to withdraw his guilty pleas ought to be dismissed."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault and incest contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and one count of sexual touching contrary to ss.155 and s.155 of the Code. He was tried in a youth court, but was acquitted on both counts. The Crown and the accused agreed that once an information alleges an offence occurred when the accused was a young person, the youth court judge has jurisdiction to embark on the inquiry. The issues on appeal were whether the youth Court judge should have assumed jurisdiction after he found the alleged offences could have occurred when he was a youth or when he ceased to be a young offender. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge was set aside and the matter remitted to a youth Court to be heard according to law.  1)The principles set out in R. v. A.(E.A.) are applicable. The case law is R. vs. B.(K.) The principles set forth in R.(E) are applicable and because of the uncertainty when the alleged acts occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, a youth courtroom. 2)The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R(S.A.). The focus of the hearing is not on guilt or innocence and at this stage of the proceedings the rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings are not strictly applied. The provisions of s.16 of the Act generally prohibits the further involvement of the judge who conducted the transfer proceedings. The Court differed on what happens if the youth judge, having embarked upon the inquiry, is unable to determine whether the offence occurred while the accused is a young or adult. 3)The issues on this appeal court court judge were whether or not to assume jurisdiction pursuant to s16 of The Act. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge was correct in declining jurisdiction on the basis he was unable to find whether the alleged crimes occurred when they occurred when she was a child or when she ceased to a young adult. 4)The issue was the appropriate jurisdiction. The accused was found guilty of both counts and could proceed to trial in a young court. The court considered the factors set out by R. (E. A.) and the applicable principles. 5)The factors set forth by R.(S.16) are relevant. The principles and applicable legislation are applicable to this case."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner was to have his child support payment as set out in the February 2007 parenting judgment be varied to provide for a four day on and four day off rotation to the parenting schedule and the deletion of paragraph 2 of the parenting judgment from the respondent's final decision making provision. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. The respondent as single parent was able to access the children 50% of the time. The child support application in this regard was dismissed. HELD: The application to vary is dismissed. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued. The applicant has not shown a material change of circumstance. The Court must also consider the context of the petitioner's 2009 income tax return. The requirement of a material or change of circumstances for an application to apply to vary cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","An action for divorce based on separation.

2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.",The court granted the divorce on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the parties had been living separate and apart for more than a year. The court determined that the parents would be jointly responsible for the children's care and that their weekly routine was consistent with that of a parent. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the wife would equally share their time with the children. He proposed that the parties retain the interest they acquired in their own pensions and that Spousal Support would be appropriate. The parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children for the duration of the trial. The mother sought to have the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in accordancewith his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost in accordance according to their respective incomes. HELD: The current parenting arrangements have been in place for five years. The current arrangements are working and there is no evidence that a change is necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship. The parents have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest. The Court found that the current arrangement was working and that the child would be better served if the father's regular access was reduced to every second weekend. The alternating of Remembrance Day and Christmas Day would not appear to be contrary to the children in the childrens best interest and grant the mother's request in that regard. The Father's Day visitation was reduced from every second Sunday to every other Saturday. The Child Support Enforcement Program payment would leave the child support figure of $100 to the mother and the table amount of $647 for child support and $100 for child care expenses. The order of the court was based on the principles set out in s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act.
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parental arrangement. The petitioner now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in the paragraph of the separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the petitioner's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of theseparation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he's no longer using the spouse. The corollaries judgment will be granted in the amount of $2,000 per month that the petitioner receives for every month that he remains in the shared parenting agreement.  The petitioner has filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. It is filed September 15, 2009. The respondent filed an affidavit in which he argues that the corollars of the divorce are set aside and that the parties' separation agreement was invalid because it reflected the wrong principles and was not binding. The petition argues that (1), since the parties had entered the separation, and because the children no longer live in a traditional parenting arrangement, the agreement was not fair to them and was therefore not binding to them. The parties have since entered a shared custody arrangement.  2) The petitioner's direct evidence is contained in Exhibit 3 and is contained at page 5. The affidavit is in the Office of the Judge and is filed at page 6. The Respondent has filed a Notice of Appeal for the Petition in which the petitioner seeks to change the spouses' relationship. The Court notes that the respondent filed a separate action for a corolla relief judgment against the petitioner in relation to spousals and child and spousum support. The issues before the Court are whether the Court should apply the corollaary relief judgement, or apply the wider Corollary Relief judgment, to the petitioner, to be incorporated into the corollo relief judgment, and whether anything outside the parties’ reasonable contemplation had occurred since the date of the agreement to undermine the integrity of the settlement. Corollaries of Divorce are filed at various levels of the Court."

The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The delay of six months was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the the accused. The reason for the delay was not established. 2)There is no evidence that any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice are something that he could overcome. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. The Court found that the accused had not suffered actual prejudice and the conditions of his release were not so onerous as result in anything but the usual prejudice over and above that suffered by other accused charged with similar offences.
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. The petitioner was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be employed. The couple had two children, Chad and Ryan. The respondent was an undischarged bankrupt. The parties' primary asset was the respondent's pension plan. The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. She attributed her difficulties to her illness in 1976 and the lingering disabilities of her children not because of the marriage. The marriage had been very stable and the parties' income was reasonably stable. The court determined that spousal support would be discontinued in 1996 because of a liquidity problem with the pension plan and the husband was not eligible to make additional contributions. The husband was to pay $300 per month as child support for the child and $350 per month for the wife. The pension plan administrator determined that the fairest way to divide the pension was to allow the wife to make the choice between the only two options available. HELD: 1)The parties had already attained the earliest eligibility date but still had not graduated. The child's primary asset, the pension, was the police pension and he was an uncharged bankrupt who subordinated his employment demands to his family obligations. The Court found that the retirement method of calculating the value of the pension would be the fairer one, as long as the child was a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the pensioners were entitled to spousals. 2)The wife was to contribute as child child support of $260 per month. She was to also pay child support based on the pension's value for the next 3 years for the children. 3)The court ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the proceeds of the sale of the assets equally divided between the parties. 4)The husband was ordered to pay as child and child support as child of $300 for the marriage, $350 for the matronly home and $500 for the husband's car. 5)The Court allowed the option of either paying lump sum amounts or periodic payments based on valuation assuming the child's retirement after 25 years of service. The statutory limitations apply."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.",HELD: The court held that the parents could not resolve the custody issue and defer to the court to determine where the child would attend school. The court found that the child was doing well in pre-school and would be better off without the parents. The parents could only resolve the issue by deferring to the Court to determine which city she would attend to. The child was normal and was resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The Court found that both parents were competent and capable parents.

5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","The Court granted the application for the second time. The application concerned disclosure only. The Court found that third party records were in the same category as the fruits of the investigation against the accused, namely, the alleged victims of aggravated assaults and particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. The Crown also sought updated criminal records for each of the accused. The court also found that the following documents had words, phrases or numbers that had no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected. The documents were numbered according to their chronological number and the number starts with the tab under which the document was found and then the chronological number of the page. The number starts at 5-2 and then goes 5-1. The document is not to be used or referred to in any other way, whether civil or criminal. The accused's interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full answer and defence will outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The accused submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was required to address s. 91 of the Code. This requires that the witness have at least some experience with the type of weapon and that it is of interest to people as decorative item. 2) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. The Court notes that the Crown argues the sword is a primacy weapon in that it only had the appearance of a sword. The only evidence before the trial court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. The trial court found that the blade was blunt and not as sharp as a traditional sword but it had a sharp edge and it was of interest for the purposes of showing respect to the type and location of the sword. 3) The accused testified that he had just purchased the sword from someone named 'Froggy'. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not have a specific reason for buying the sword, but he was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores and that the item was of special interest to the people as a decoration item. The police attended to the scene where they saw the accused walking with an older female. As he met up with her and her uncle and her parents, he met them up at a novelty grocery store. As she was aware of the sale of the wares in novelty store, he pulled them up and put them on the counter. He slowly lay on the ground on his stomach, with his hands out to his sides. He had a strong odour of liquor on his breath and slurred his speech. The female who had been with him disappeared. The defence sought to admit the evidence of the appellant on the basis that he bought the sword for $10.00 at some point from someone else.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In 1997, the defendant purchased the property from the plaintiffs and entered into an agreement with Great Plains to continue to operate the golf Course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. The defendants refused to accept the plaintiff's expert's report and sought injunctive relief to prevent them from operating the ninth Hole until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations in the expert'sreport. HELD: The plaintiff's application was dismissed.  1) The plaintiff cannot succeed simply because the defendant refused to comply with the plaintiff’s recommendations. 2) The defendant’ s position was that the golf ball problem was an ongoing issue for the plaintiffs for more than 10 years and that they could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The court found that the wording in the Option Agreement between Great Plains and the defendants affirms that the plaintiff anticipated the number of errant balls that would enter his or her yard. 4) The plaintiffs were awarded injunctions to put an end to the ongoing nuisance. 5) The defendants were ordered to pay $18,000 to the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  6) The Court refused to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem."

The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and granted leave to appeal on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds and allowed the Crown's appeal. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s.679(3) of the section. Turning to the public Interest, the applicant would be inimical to the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the likelihood, as I see it, of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."

Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the erection of signs on private property and restricted the use of signs which were not permitted in the downtown core area. The respondents argued that the signs were intrusive and distracting and posed safety concerns to pedestrians and other motorist. The Town argued that since the by laws were rationally connected to the objective and did not prevent advertising, the limits imposed demonstrably justified under s.2 of the Charter. The application was allowed and an order was issued pursuant to 266(3) of the municipal government act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs to the respondents were $1,500 against all respondents. The limiting measures of the bylaw were rational connected to and effectively addressed unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of the signs. The primary objectives of the By-laws were to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prevent distraction to motorist and pedestrians. The by-law also addressed the issue of whether or not the Town has a right to regulate the erection or destruction of signs. In this proceeding any restriction on the respondents' freedom of expression are rational and are based on preserving and facilitating the Town’s planning goals. The violation is reasonably and demonstrably justifiable within the meaning of s.1 of the charter. The limited measures were rally connected to their objective and effectively addresses unrestricted useof available space to maximizes use of sign. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevent ads, but only limits it. The limitation did not prevents advertising, but limited it."

The Court of appeal then apportioned liability between the applicant and the Municipality at 50% each. The present action follows the first action, which was appealed and was apportioning liability between both the applicant municipality and the municipality. The second action was also appealed and the court allowed certain amount of the claim, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale, to be considered.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. The Public Trustees is a public trustee and is not served with notices of application for property guardianship and did not intervene in such applications. The practice under the previous legislation was very much ad hoc. If the applicant was from out of the Province or was not a beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, bonds were usually required. The applicant was not seeking to be appointed without a bond and the fees charged by the public trustee are set out in Regulation to the Public Guardian and Trustee Act. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a Bond. 2) This was not an appropriate situation to dispensed with a Bond as the applicant did not have adequate assets to administer the estate. The Court reviewed the applications and found that the application to be made personal decision making and decision-makers was a routine one. The application to appoint personal decision makers was in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted.

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When he turned right, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. The plaintiff locked his doors and skidded to a halt, attempting to avoid the other vehicle. HELD: The defendant was convicted of failing yield. 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that the intersection was safe to do so. The court found that his failure to yield did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failing to yielding the defence of due diligence was established. 2)The court found no evidence that either driver was impaired. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. The pedestrian may also have had only parking lights on."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. HELD: The application for calculation of the amountof child maintenance was returned to the Chamber list for March 8, 2004. The only benefit which would be derived from ordering a trial of the issue as to child maintenance by mother was to enhance counsels' fees.  1) The mother's failure to produce any financial information was not the only reason the issue was adjournned. Whether the mother would be required to produce the father's business records would be another matter because counsel for Mr. Overs did not have the slightest interest in canvassing the father for financial information. Whether he canvassed the father would not be of any assistance because the parties could not afford such expense. Whether it would be appropriate to have the father canvass the father in the absence of the mother to determine his income would be a matter for the court. 2) Counsel for Mr Overs did find it necessary to canvass for financial records of the numbered corporation owned by the husband's wife to determine the amount payable by the petitioner. Harkening back to the 1999 judgement, the father stated that he would not require the mother's attendance at the ranch nor to obtain any records of her father's farming operation.  3) Counsel provided no evidence as to why the respondent would continue to canvather for financial evidence in the father’s absence. Counsel for the respondent did not seek financial information from the numbered company nor could he determine the actual amount of income from the operation with her. Counsel provided the respondent with a bank account. Counsel argued that since the corporation owned but one truck operated by the father, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that income from it should be imputed to the petitioner would be nothing less then ludicrous. The fact that the petitioner’S income is deposited into a joint bank account does not justify imputing portion of that income to the homemaker spouse. Counsel submitted that income should be canvassed for"

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry. The accused was not called as a witness. The Court heard no evidence of any measurements, observations or calculations made by the accused in relation to an accident reconstruction nor did the Crown attempt to file any crash data retrieval information. The only issue was whether the Defence was entitled to an adjournment to call Sergeant Barbar as a witnesses. HELD: The accused is entitled to be called as his witness."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused's identity was established on an Appearance Notice and a letter from SGI issued to the accused. Although there was no identification of the accused in court, the Crown sought a Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention to be tender. The Certificate was never issued to counsel. The accused admitted receiving the notice but argued that he had not signed it.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants based on allegations that one or more of the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants denied having hired an independent contractor and claimed the claimed privilege was waived. The parties also brought several other questions related to the use of the helicopter shuttle service, including whether it was unsafe for the plaintiffs to use it, to obtain information from the applicant, to call into evidence witnesses, to assess the credibility of answers that may be provided by corporate officers with respect to the reasons for the choices they were made and to test the credibilityof answers that could be provided if given the chance. The questions related only to the pilot's report and not to the helicopter-jousting issue were properly answered."

The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets.

The court has jurisdiction to vary the agreement on the grounds alleged notwithstanding that the Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction .","The respondent commenced an action for divorce against the respondent on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered the agreement.

Deliberations: 1) as agreed by the parties, there was no question that the respondent was entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia. She was also entitled to seek a divisionof assets under s. 29 of the Nova Scotia Matrimonial Property Act and to seek division of liabilities under the provisions of the Matrionial Property act. 2) The respondent by virtue of the Judicature Act is entitled to the same relief as accorded to the plaintiff in Welding v.

She is also entitled in the same action entitled to a division in assets under S. 29of the NovaSC Matrimony Property Act in the course of her proceeding."
b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications were brought under the Family Maintenance Act s.10. The respondent sought an order for the payment of child support by reducing the monthly maintenance payable by reducing it from $250 to $250 and cancelling the arrears of $13,273.39. The mother sought to cancel the order by cancelling $13 million in maintenance payments accrued under the 1993 order and by varying the access provisions of the 1993 Order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was not in a position to pay full monthly maintenance provided by the 1993 orders and therefore cancelled the arreears. The Court reduced the ardds by ordering that upon the payment $5000 on account of the arrow accrued prior to December 31, 1998, the balance of the Arrears accrued prior prior to such date shall be extinguished. The arrearages were $11,838.39 and not $13.72 for the 1997 and 1998 child support payments. The petitioner was not prepared to apply for a further variation of the order. The order of the Maintenance Enforcement Officer was also reduced."

The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the hotel since 1989. She filed a grievance in 2000 alleging that her work hours had been reduced due to a change in management. The respondent denied this allegation and applied for judicial review. Application for judicial Review granted; portions of the decision accepted; portions were not accepted; the decision was not appealed; the court found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation; the appeal court found the wording to be patently unreasonable and it could not be read into the language of the collective agreement as being arbitrary and inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties. The court found there was no logical basis upon which words of that import could be read and the court could not support the conclusion that Article 9':01 could reasonably be given an interpretation that had the potential to detrimentally affect employees returning from maternity leave, depending on their standing of seniority."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. The Court held that the Crown had failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a) of The Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held that in order to obtain a new trial, the Crown must satisfy the Court with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury. The trial judge did not confuse the issue of fact with either the actus reus or the mens rea of dangerous Driving. The jurisprudence currently recognizes four situations. The first is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no evidence. The second is an honest mistake. The judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. The third is an incorrect assumption. The error of fact is not an issue here. The decision of the trial court was based on a misunderstanding of law. The errors of law are not new to the Court. The Supreme Court of Canada held that it is not possible to tell whether a person made a mistake by driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public in all the circumstances. The test that the Court must apply is not new. The majority opinion in R. v. Morin (2006 SCC 26) held that if the Court orders a new Trial, it could rule on the admissibility of Cst. Low's expert opinion evidence."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions were based on Queen's B Bench Rule 188. In each case, the plaintiff had commenced a action within the limitation period as provided in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act. The limitation period had expired and the plaintiff was directed to commence a new action. The action was adjourned sine die. The third motion was brought by the same defendants. Allowing the application, that with the exception of the claims based on malice, the action should be struck because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed in s.(3)(d) and s. 4(e) of that Act. While the cause of action had fully accrued and the appellant had a prima facie case, it was arguable that the limitation time had not run until after the expiration of the one year limitation period."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act, or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due, and where he has no title the purchase-money never becomes payable. This argument mixes two different streams of the law of garnishment: the law pertaining to 'conditional debts' and that dealing with the garnishable debt. In the former, the debt becomes an unconditional liability at the time fixed for payment, and is conditional upon the vendors being able to make title, and in the latter, where he can assign his right to payment to someone else, the purchase money never becomes paid. Both streams of garnishing law speak in terms of conditional debt. The case of the garnished note in Roblee was different because it was a long-term GIC and not a conditional debt and therefore subject to the garnishment of a long term GIC. The garnishment case in this case was different from that in other cases."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The original custody judgement had provided for the joint custody with shared custody of 5 years of age. The mother, who had recently been removed from Saskatchewan, opposed the application for sole custody but argued that it was in the child's best interests to move with the father to Whitehorse, Yukon, on a more secure basis. She also sought less restrictive access. Application for access granted to the child by the mother; the father granted sole custody to the mother and access granted only to the father; the mother was granted interim custody and the father sole custody. The child was to have regular weekly access and the mother's access was to be limited to those with access to the Child. The father had taken the child out of Saskatchewan and was now residing in Whitehorse. The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined in the original judgment and the child was well adjusted socially and emotionally. The increased contact with her extended family in the Yukon (including her paternal grandparents and her maternal grandfather) provided an increased social network that would be in the best interest of the children. Although the mother initially opposed the father's application for custody, she later changed her mind and said that she wished to move closer to the family. The court reviewed each of these factors and found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the original Custody Judgment. The decision of the SCC in Gordon v. Goertz was based on the same principles as that in Allston v. Kurz. Johnston v. Kaluz, 2004 SKQB 275. The SCC states that a material difference in circumstances existed when it was thought that cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for joint parenting, was possible. As the mother demonstrated that it wasn't, a review of the custodial parent's order as to custody is justified."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders made by the Board pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required the company to comply with its obligations to obtain and produce materials requested by UFCW. The corporate parent objected to the subpoena and sought the production of additional documents. The Trade Union Act prohibits the use of third party documents in the workplace, but the Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning. The application for a declaration that the Board is not subject to the Charter provisions of the Trade Union act and is not seeking to interfere with the tribunal's jurisdiction, is not opposed to but against. The parties agree that a review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record. HELD: The order was quashed. The Board conceded that it had not had the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and production orders in the manner it had done in the past. The Order was also quashed in respect of the alleged breaches of the Charter by the corporate parent. The Court held that the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to order the production and destruction of documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was without jurisdiction to do so. The Supreme Court has not held that s. 2(d) of the Constitution Act is unconstitutional. The Saskatchewan Court has held that it has the jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. The issue is whether the legislature intended the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal. The fact that the board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. The subpoena and the production order were struck. The portions of the subpoena that were struck are not part of that record. The portion that were not struck are of no relevance to the application. The remainder of the portion that had been struck are irrelevant and do not constitute part of this record. In this sense, the Board incorporated the Evidence into its order within the exceptions outlined by Denning and the standard of review."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for a fixed monthly compensation rate based on new policies, on an average of $1,000 per month. The termination reduced the level of compensation on new policy renewals by 25% and eliminated the incentive for selling to less experienced sales agents. The sales agent claimed that since his compensation was based on the basis of his prior year's sales, rather than on commissions, he would have been in a better position to mitigate his damages. Allstate denied this claim. The Court of Appeal held that, in the circumstances, Allstate had not proven that it had not provided reasonable alternatives to the sales agent's compensation. The defendant applied the test in Cronk v. Canadian General Insurance Company (1994), which held that if the terminated employee had chosen to move to Nova Scotia, he might have been entitled to a pay rise of as much as $3,000. The trial judge rejected the argument that the non- competition clause was a material factor in determining whether the terminated agent should receive less compensation. Rather, he rejected the idea that the terminated individual had made little effort to seek alternative employment."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were in a relationship for approximately thirty years and had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement and alleged that the husband was abusive of her. The husband had been deployed for five months and the children were in his care every second weekend. The parties had little face to face and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. The children were placed in the husband’s custody and the husband had sole custody of the children while he was deployed. The mother expressed surprise and dismay at the husband when he asked her to return to high school and the parties’ common ground. She did not take the opportunity to explain her position on the parenting issue. HELD: 1) While shared parenting is appropriate for the children, it does not mean that they should be parented by one parent. The father was required to perform all of the parenting tasks. The child’d be expected to learn how to manage their time with their mother and there was no evidence that the wife was unable to do so. The evidence did not support the assertion that the mother was incapable of doing so. 2) The evidence from the parties was inconclusive. It was clear that the parties had no common ground regarding the parenting arrangements. 3) The children had been in the wife’S care for approximately 30 days at the time of the separation and she had consistently refused to cooperate with the husband on any of the child”s parenting matters. The court found that the interactions between the parties were hostile and it was difficult for the wife to understand her role in the parenting process. The Court found that both parties were unable to provide appropriate support and counsel. 4) The Court was satisfied that the children would not benefit from joint parenting if there was a power imbalance between the spouses. The nature and extent of the conflict between the parents was one factor to be considered."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing until November at which time the respondent Authority would review a decision of the respondent authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction and the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. There was nothing unconscionsable about allowing the hearing to continue even if it should become known to the Crown. 3)Discretion should not be directed to decide what a decision for potential penalty imposed by the Commission is or is not in any event effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There is nothing unconsciuous about allowing a Commission hearing to be held in a procedural fashion and none was known to be done."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective counsel of the complainant. The matter was remitted to a trial judge to determine whether the appellant should have taken the position that his non-lawyer was not a competent lawyer. The court found that because the complainant had not been properly advised of the legal process beforehand and there was no evidence that she would have been impeached by the Crown, the decision to use audio evidence as a defence was not made lightly. The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the spouse by challenge to the audio tape was made by the appellant as a reaction to the complainant's choice of counsel. The appellant did not have confidence in the counsel as he did not want to be associated with the Crown's legal affairs and was not prepared to challenge the complainant more vigorously on her allegations and to seek further corroborative evidence of her story before laying the charge. The decision to not testify was made freely based on information fully at hand that the agent was not trained in the legal system. The judge believed the complainant and there were no errors made by him in the trial process. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact. The appeal is dismissed."

The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff, now 30 years old, sued the alleged driver and his insurance company (which was defending the action against its insured Jerome Thomas under his reservation of rights) under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The parties agreed to a sum of $162,500 which was reduced by considerably due to the plaintiff's admission that he had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the woman he had seen in the mall parking area, and that he did not recognize the driver from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation. The Court also considered the reliability of the statements submitted by the third party, including whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate the van.HELD: The Court found that the third parties' credibility were in dispute as to the identity of the driver and the identity as the driver. The court found that although the plaintiff had no idea the driver was from the mall, he assumed that he was the driver when he spotted the van parked in front of the store. The third party's credibility was also questioned as to whether the plaintiff was aware of the location of the vehicle when it was struck and, in addition, whether the vehicle was in driveable condition. The evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The issue was whether the third Party was to pay the plaintiff or the plaintiff himself. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitated number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially related to the issues of the identity the vehicle which struck the plaintiff, the identity and owner of that vehicle and whether the owner had the driver's consent for operate it when the incident occurred. Since the defendant did not reach the parking lot until after the van had sped away, the only clear evidence before the court on the identity was that of the plaintiff. The defendant admitted that he sold the van, but had no proof of its ownership. He also testified that he didn't recognize the vehicle from the Police Department photo lineup entered in the Court's Main Registry and that there was no evidence that he allowed or authorized a person other than himself to operate it. The Plaintiff's claim that he knew the driver but only assumed that the driver resided in another state and did not have the driver"

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to trafficking contraryto s. 267(a) of The Trade Facilitation Act. The evidence was obtained after the initial stop and was excluded pursuant to s24(2). HELD: The Court held that all evidence obtained after that initial stop should be excluded pursuantto s24.(2). It would not place any particular significance upon the fact that the accused did not see green material in the complainant's purse as he advised her that she was under arrest for possession of marijuana. The Court found that the evidence obtained post-stop was not relevant to the investigation of the accused's vehicle as it did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. The accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed and that all of the evidence gathered after the first stop should not be excluded. The court found that in light of the officer's actions and manner of driving, the Court found no symptoms of intoxication. The strong odour of raw marijuana emanating from the interior of the vehicle would in itself amount to reasonable grounds for lawful detention but also for arrest. The Crown did not require the accused to look at the bag that had been tossed out of the complainant’s vehicle. The presence of a small child in the back seat of the car during the search was entirely reasonable. The clear law surrounding the search for drugs and alcohol in motor vehicles does not preclude the use of the police in the course of their duties. The police are authorized to make certain inquiries and need not turn blind eye to matters which legitimately raise their suspicions. The s. 4 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. The rights of the people on duty in the check stops should not been turned into means of conducting either an unfounded general inquisition or an unreasonable search."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"FIRE, A Crown Corporation contracted to represent the applicant a prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. Much was made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigating of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation.

b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. The appellant had been in a small room with only three persons present when she and her friend, who had been out buying cigarettes, visited the victim. The judge found that the appellant sat on the couch across from the kitchen table where the victim was seated and that at some point shortly after their arrival, the appellant got up and proceeded through the doorway behind the victim to use the washroom. A few moments later the victim felt something wrap around his throat and he was choked until he passed out. The Crown and the defence both took the stand in their respective states, accusing the appellant of robbery, assault with weapon and wearing a belt around the victim's neck to choke him.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","Rule 37.02 – Order for Consolidation – Motion dismissed – Request for consolidation The Court reviewed the rules and case authorities before it and found that although there were common issues and facts between the four defendants, there was not sufficient commonality regarding the nature of evidence intended to be called at trial. The Court found that the matters being heard together were not the same issues as the ones being heard separately and that there was no evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule."

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The defendant sold business equipment to the plaintiff in September 2007. The plaintiff alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentATION, unjust enrichment and unjust enrichment. The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The Plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn in Whitewaw and in September of 2007 entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment, the Cash Equipment and the Camera Equipment. The Cash Equipment was designed to enter and receive payments for purchases at the inn, mostly restaurant purchases. The Camera Equipment was intended to provide security and to monitor the actions of the employees of the business. HELD: The plaintiff was not found to have suffered any damage. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within two years of the claim being discovered. This claim was discovered prior to 2007 and therefore the Plaintiff had until October 2009 to commence his action. His action was not commenced until January 2010. There was no evidence of fraud or of unjust enrichment as there was no service contract between the parties. The defendant supplied the equipment and installed it correctly. There is no material representation and no fraud as there were no service contracts between the Parties. The Court concluded that there was nothing to allow the plaintiff to conclude that the evidence showed that the Cash equipment was not working properly and that the plaintiff had completed his part of the transaction by supplying and installing the equipment. There were no material representations and no fraudulent or unjust enrichment, as there is no service agreement between the companies. The defendants signed an agreement to supply the equipment to them and install it. The court concluded that the claim was statute barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007 and they had not performed their part of their agreement and were not in breach and therefore there was further no evidence that the Plaintiff was satisfied with the work done. The Defendants supplied the Equipment that they agreed to provide and in their view, installed it properly. The evidence does not support the conclusion that there is any material representation or any fraud as the plaintiff was unable to establish that the Equipment installed correctly. The Certificate of Analysis (CDAs) was considered by the Court and was found to be the original of the action. The Defendant supplied the rest of the equipment that the plaintiffs were ordered to install and the equipment was in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff at all material times."
d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applied to the plaintiffs’ amended claim. It did not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.

The plaintiffs had not filed an application for an order disallowing the amendments or for an extension of time to commencing the action on a nunc pro tunc basis.
6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The sole director of the company manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director. The companies were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. They appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, where the convictions were set aside. The Queen's Court judge who heard their appeal allowed it and set aside the convictions. He did so on the basis the steps taken in connection with the manufacture of the log- home packages by the company and Varga were not such as to engage the licensing provisions of the Act. With that, the Attorney General applied to the court for leave to appeal on the ground the judge misconstrued the licensing provision of the act and thus misapplied them. HELD: Appeal allowed. The convictions must stand. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not to the extent and to the effect the judge of the Courtof Queen'sBench thought appropriate. The fines and surcharges were nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they too must stand"
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The Director argued that the Chambers judge erred by misapplying certain information about the circumstances of the respondent, who was sitting in the Vehicle, as part of his arguments. The respondent entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. The accused pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 80 hours of community service. The Chambers judge was also at pains to emphasize that the Vehicle was not their only asset of any kind. They were also considering whether to appeal the conviction of the common law spouses and whether the Court should grant leave to appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that the case law precedes exceptional circumstances, where a decision of this nature is often made in the context of a case such as this one. With respect to issues (a) and (b), it is not at all sure that the judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime, and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case legislation in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making process."

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant, who had been injured to his lower back in an automobile accident, applied for income replacement benefits contending the accident did not cause the disc herniation. The respondent Saskatchewan Government Insurance denied the claim. The applicant applied for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. The evidence of two family physicians in support of his contention was insufficient to establish causation on a balanced of probabilities.[1] The applicant was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. A review of all of the evidence led the Court to conclude that the applicant had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on the balance of probability. His appeal was dismissed.[2]Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. The deceased was not found to be suffering from herniation or from other injuries or dysfunction in his discs. Up to October 1995, the disc began to heal and he was symptom free for several weeks. He began to experience pain in the same area as the pain he suffered after the accident, but then began to feel worse. For a period of time after the discHerniation, he was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the herniated was caused by the accident."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The Court found that the observation period was not conducted properly and that the police officer was not in a position to check for licence, registration and sobriety. The video evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count #1 as it was not shown on the video. The officer did not look 'eyeball to eyeball' at the accused for the entire duration of the observation as it is viewed as a reasonable limit prescribed by law and justified under s. of the Charter. The observations were not conducted in a fashion that would violate the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights.

b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff, who was the primary caretaker of the infant, was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of profuse vaginal bleeding. The defendant, who had performed the caesarian section delivery operation, was called in to attend to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, Dr. Urbanski, was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hysterectomy, which could otherwise have been avoided, became inevitable. The plaintiffs sued for their irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery. HELD: 1)The medical evidence showed that the most likely cause of the bleeding was retained products of conception. The doctors' reports and the hospital records all showed that there was a small amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity, which was likely the source of the bleed. The patient's hospital records did not show this. 2)The Court found that the surgical care provided by the defendant was not the only method which could have remedied the bleeding, given the advanced stage of the necrosis and the degree of deterioration. The surgical care offered by the defendants was not based on a pure science and was not, in the least, the most appropriate approach. 3)The surgical care of the plaintiff was the most important issue. The court ordered that the records be received as prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. 4)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the loss of the child and for damages awarded to the defendant for the hospital and the surgical expenses incurred in the care of her care. 5)The court also ordered that certain surgical expenses be paid to the plaintiffs to be paid in full. 6)The plaintiffs claim that the costs of the operation were justified by the fact that the plaintiff had to perform a hystrocystomy which could not have been prevented due to the obstreperous nature of the hemorrhage. 7)The claim that costs were awarded in the amount of $50,000 to the mother. 8)The doctors' notes were to be treated as substantive evidence and weighed against all other admissible evidence in deciding the issues."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.",The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer. The accused was on duty at 2:00 a.m. when the Citizens on Patrol Program personnel were on the lookout for a vehicle that was driving erratically. The police observed the accused use the telephone for a short period of time and then noticed him use the phone for a few minutes. He was asked if he had anything to drink and the officer advised him that he had had a little bit of beer earlier. The officer advised the accused that he should not drink and drive and advised him to watch for any problems. The conversation was short and he did not move towards the door. The refusal was attributed to anxiety attacks. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain a sample and that the Intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece.
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties and a further order preservingand detaining them. The defendants had filed an application under s. 33(2)(b) of the Builders' Lien Act seeking an order preservation and detraining certain proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a separate order preserving & detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicants had not met the first two tests of the mandatory injunction test. 2)Saskatchewan courts must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as a principle test. 3)The Court must be cautious to see if the defendant has a moral or legal duty to act positively. If the applicants show a strong probability that the proceeds of their actions will be sufficient to satisfy the first test, they must demonstrate irreparable harm. 4)The court must be aware that the applicants would suffer irreparable damage if the order was not granted because of the numerous liens filed by the defendants. 5)Safer litigation would be a better remedy if the defendants were required to pay full compensation. 6)The issue here was the balance of convenience test. The applicants failed to meet the first three tests. 7)The plaintiff must prove a very strong probability of grave damage which will accrue to him in the future. 8)The applicant's assertion of irreparableharm will become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under S. 253)(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for police as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: 1) The accused's evidence was not credible as it tends to show that the accused's consumption of alcohol was consistent with both: (i) him not having BAC of over 80 mg% at the time of driving; and (ii) the BAC readings were determined by the alcohol expert. The accused was found not to have had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer had reasonable reasons for not acting as if the accused had been drinking alcohol all day. 2) The Court accepted the accused’s testimony that he had only consumed six beer and that his level of intoxication was in his view borderline and he required an ASD test to give him the grounds to make an Intoxilyzer demand. 3) The evidence was accepted. The only witness was a alcohol expert who gave opinion evidence on the drinking history of the accused. He was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the alleged alcohol consumption. The defence argued that the drinking was so low in the blood that it was a flight of the legs. The court found that the evidence of the alcoholics was at odds with the accused and accepted the evidence from the alcohol experts. 4) The court was satisfied that there was a reasonable reason for the accused not stopping, given that his blood-alcohol concentration was over 80mg% at that time. The drinking history was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed. The appellant’ s. 12 driving prohibition was not valid because of the drinking habits of the individuals he had met and because of what the accused claimed was a “last drink” defence. The Crown was not convinced that the alcoholic was not trying to elude or get away from the police. The evidence of Cobbledick and the accused was at issue. The issues were whether there was proof beyond areasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. The issue was whether the accused offered a credible reason for not pulling over and driving."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The Crown could not demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the minute following the transaction with the accused. The accused was the constant observer with binoculars who never lost sight of the accused, Carvery, who could have been purchased earlier in the evening and had been in his possession before he met Mr. Carvery on Gottingen Street. His possession was done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in the bagged substance appeared to be consistent with street level drug trafficking practices. The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was walking with the client when the transaction took place and that he gestured to another place for the deal to take place. The encounter between the buyer and the accused was not consistent with the pattern police officers would typically observe in street level drugs trafficking. However, the evidence respecting a piece of plastic baggy that was cut with a pen and paper could be seen by the Court as the accused gestured towards another place to avoid detection. The appellant's evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level transaction was consistent with these drug trafficking activities and not consistent for any other possible explanations."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and s.255(1(b). The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There will be no costs. The Court held that the trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The trial judge found that the waiver did not remedy the deficiency for the accused, nor rendered any wavier ineffective. The Trial Judge committed no error in finding and finding a breach of s.10(b) for there was evidence to support both findings and there was no error of law. The accused was not provided an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The matter was abandoned."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert. The owner argued that the board's decision to refuse to grant an adjournment to prepare his appeal against the demolition order had been motivated by a history of non-compliance, the intolerable sub-standard living conditions endured by the tenants, and the absence of a pro-active board to responsibly manage the safety and security of the residents and visitors. He alleged that the order was biased against the vulnerable and vulnerable. The board confirmed the demolition ordered and confirmed the building's demolition order. The respondent seeks a period of 6 months from the date of the appeal to bring forth his written proposal. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The Board's order is confirmed. 2) The Board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. In this way the board has ensured that the plaintiff knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 3) The board has compliedwith the directionof the Saskatchewan court of appeal to ensure that all disclosure is made to both parties. The applicant has not been denied his right to proceed with his appeal."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The Director's application was granted.  1)The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. 2)The Director's legal effect vis-a-vis the property seized is not changed with passage of the2009 Act. 3)The Law of the Land is Created: The Act sets out the test the court must apply in determining whether to order forfeiture of seized property. Under both regimes the terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof. There is no evidence that the legislation has fundamentally altered the state of the law or altered rights as of past time. The Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone. 4)The Court rejected the Director’s argument that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 legislation was prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The legislation is a civil not Criminal in nature, and it does not have a criminal offence for the Director to pursue civil remedies under this statute. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child, who was unemployed, applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. The mother of two questioned the father's financial situation. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and return to school will not have a material effect on the father. The child support he was ordered to pay was retroactive. 2) The mother's choice as to work only three months of the year was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. 3) The child care expenses were ordered to be paid based on the mother's $60,000 annual income and the father must pay $328 per month as and for the support of the child.  4) The applicant's mother had filed a supplemental Reply in August 2003 which was not satisfactory. The applicant then brought a motion to compel the father to provide additional financial disclosure. The application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father was determined by an arbitrator. The applications were not heard for more than a month. 5) The primary questions to be answered were whether the father had intentionally made a decision to work less than $600 per month and to only work 3 months of year. The evidence showed he had not pursued any employment opportunities since his termination with Ipsco. He had not made any serious attempts to find employment. The court was of the view that the father could find employment that would provide a reasonable income. 6) The application should be allowed to proceed retroactively."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Labour Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or with a purposive approach, the result is the same. The ordinary meaning of s5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power tomake interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint before the labour Relations Board, or the existence in the Labour relations Board to make final order in respect of the application; and the existence and power in the labour board to make that order in the same process."

Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The judge granted the application on the basis that he had not been privy to the information requested regarding the witness not being available at the date of the trial.

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of 2 years less 1 day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house; theft; breaking and breaking and attempting to obtain jewellery; breaking into a dwelling property; breaking down a bank vault; theft. HELD: 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. The judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999. 2)The community support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training was likely to be more effective than the sentence of three to four years imposed. However, when one reviews this record it becomes easy to see the gravity of the offences and the need for community protection. A penitential sentence is not appropriate when all the circumstances presented are already in danger of being used as justification for it. A community sentence is appropriate when the offences are already being dealt with in the context of rehabilitating. A conditional sentence is imposed when all of the circumstances are considered."

Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. 2)The wording of the subsection and the legislation surrounding it all add to the uncertainty. 3)The legislature said nothing of the possible effects of timely posting but untimely receipt of notice of appeals. That being so, and since the period could not be extended in the absence of power of enlargement in the statute, the court held that the appeal could not possibly be entertained. 4)At best, the right to appeal to the boardof revision exercised properly or effectively. The phrase 'could give notice by meansof registered mail' must also be taken in implication to allowing for notice of appealed by meansOf course, giving notice by registered mail, unlike giving notice via email, does not entail a single act occurring over a span of time. It entails series of acts occurring over span of span of days, beginning with posting, continuing with delivery, and ending with receipt. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. Moreover, this is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail as in the sort described in s. 303(1).

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit showing that disclosure had been made. The respondent then applied to the Queen'sBench for an order of prohibition. The order was granted on the reasoning that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.

9_2008skpc147.txt,"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.",The plaintiff and the defendant had a contract to feed and maintain one hundred and one cows for the defendant. The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundredandone cows. The plaintiff cared for the cows as he did in the 2004 contract. He sent monthly invoices to the defendant who paid them as they were born. The defendant never received a bill for the cattle. The parties conducted their business together according to the terms of the 2004 agreement with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to 60 cents per day per cow. Another sixty calves were delivered to the plaintiff's pastures in the spring and early summer. Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be. He testified that he and the plaintiff never had a chance to sit down and discuss the bonus. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $850 for the $900 he owed for each live calf brought to his attention. The court had no way of accurately determining whether the figure should be $800 or $900 because the parties did not reach an agreement where the plaintiff was entitled to pay the sum which had been previously refused. The agreement between the parties that the plaintiff refused to pay any sum for the second consecutive year was not enforceable except by an agreement between them as to the amount of the bonus which had not been reached. The Court has no way to accurately determine whether the amount should be between the plaintiff and defendant except by a determination of the parties as to whether the agreement was enforceable.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. The defendant alleges that this ice and snow had built up along the edge of the road such that it acted as a ramp that lifted the truck up and over the guardrail to land in the excavation site. HELD: The application to add Saskatoon to the list of third parties is granted as requested. 1) The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it. It is not proper to assess evidence or go into possible defences.  2) It is proper to determine the prima facie claim of a third parties and to assess whether the applicant has filed material which establishes a prima Facie claim against the proposed third party. 3) The applicant has not filed any evidence to assess prejudice to the plaintiff.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation.

M. assisted the police in solving other crimes, placing himself in other crimes and implicating others for which actions he received threats. 2)The youth court judge counted time JM. had spent under custody as secure Custody. 3)The Court was informed that J. m. was given the opportunity to participate in the escape described in relation to the other youth and made the conscious decision not to do so.

d_1998canlii13884.txt,"FIAT. The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.","FIAT. The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) of s. Charter to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. Defence counsel opposed the application. The Crown argued that the delay was unnecessary and was not sufficient to prejudice the accused. Defence argued that if the delay is not unreasonable, it does not cause the accused any prejudice. The Court rejected the defence's argument that the 35 month delay was excessive and was caused by the Crown's application to remove the prosecutor. The application was dismissed. The 7 month delay caused by defence counsel's request to remove a prosecutor was not unreasonable. The 8 month delay is caused by scheduling delays which occurred as a result of defence counsel requesting the removal of the prosecutor prior to the preliminary hearing. The delay is also caused by Crown actions which the accused has not previously disclosed. The 9 month delay by defence of the application was not unreasonable. The 10 month delay due to the application to have the prosecutor removed was not reasonable. The 11 month delay attributed to the actions of the accused was not unusual. The absence of information from the RCMP and the delay in the execution of various motions by defence lawyers were not grounds to waive delay. The 15 month delay did not prejudice the Crown as the accused had been prohibited from leaving Saskatchewan for several months prior to his arrest and was employed throughout the delay. There was no evidence as to the cause for the delay or how it affected the accused's reputation."
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue in Andrew (CA) is whether or not the trial judge considered Hrynewich Holdings in its entirety. HryNewich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of s.(25) of the LCRA and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. However, it is instructive when interpreting the spirit & intent of ss. of the lAA. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants. 1) The court spoke on the historical background of depression-era legislation in Lozinski Mayoh and Mayoh. While it was clear the Court was aware of its previous decision, it was forgetful of its conclusions as to how sale proceeds should be allocated against the purchase money debt and nonpurchase funds. However the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.  2) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding and the reasons in HryNEWICH Holdings are the reasons behind the disposition of this appeal. 3) The appeal in Andrew will deal with the issue of the proper amount of the deficiency judgment. The court will deal specifically with the issues of the sale proceeds and the proper proportion of the total sale proceeds. The appellant is entitled, pursuant to s. 2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, to take into account the sale of land by judicial sale of goods and services (including purchase money, non-Purchase money and machinery). 4) The Court will deal primarily with the purchase and non Purchase money portions of the debt. 5) The appellant will be entitled to the balance owing on the purchase, non Purchased money portion of the loan. 6) The respondent will be allowed to sue on the basis of the purchase price of $56,280 for the balance owed."

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.",The applicant sought to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that she would have sole custody of the 7 year old daughter and the respondent would not be removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of their mother since that time. The mother had indicated in her notice of motion that she intended to move to Kelowna to enroll the daughter in a Christian private school and she had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture that she did not need and allowing him to move back into the matrimonial home. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents and there was nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have beenreasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. 2)The threshold criteria was satisfied. 3)The evidence was inconclusive as there was no evidence that the applicant raised any objection to the move. 4)The Court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community. 5)The court was not prepared to grant interim relief without a determination on the merits.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The defendant/plaintiff sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contracts. The plaintiff counterclaimed for expenses it claimed due to the failure to perform the contract. The court found that the defendant's responsibilities under thecontract were not as extensive as they would have been if the wording in the original invitation for tender had been used. The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of equipment rentals, equipment rentals & other expenses it claims were required due to its failure to Perform the contract, and for services it had never been paid. The defendants' counterclaim for damages arising out of losses arising out from losses, by the plaintiff/plattee's unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras, and which it has never been awarded. The nature of the work, the type and model of equipment used, and the amount of money used were all in the purchase order. The equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and used as described in the response to the tender. The materials used were not thesame materials as those listed in the tender and were used to blend coal. The transport and lifting of coal from the coal mine to the LBC was not straightforward and the equipment was not used to move coal. However, the plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being lifted and to reduce the risk of fire within the banks. The loan from the third party to the fourth party was used to bring coal from other sources to the bank. The fourth party, which was the equipment supplier, was to be paid on the weights determined at the bank level. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to only be construed by the wording of the tender, and any variation in wording between the 1984 invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for bids was inconsequential. The contract was not subject to the parol evidence rule. The Court found that in light of the defendants' agreement to delay commencement of the contractual contract and the fact that the equipment supplied was not as described by the tender for the purpose of setting out the requested tender, nothing herein turned on the delay in commencement of work nor in respect to the type of equipment brought on site by the defendants."

The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so.
