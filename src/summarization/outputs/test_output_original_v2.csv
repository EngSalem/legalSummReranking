0,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"This was the second bankruptcy for this bankrupt. The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of just under $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. HELD: An order requiring the bankrupt to pay monthly installments of $500 for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income he would be remiss if did not offer the court's assistance to educate the bankrupt relating to this obligation.","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to ss.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and directing the Registrar of land Titles at Battleford to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation in the form of damages from the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not in my opinion a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. The title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.  2)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon had been satisfied. On the facts of this case there has been an obvious mistake which requires rectification. The confidence of the public in the administration of justice and the land title system would be in danger of being undermined if such obvious mistakes were not cured by the courts.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other."
2,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"After the death of his wife, the executors of three separate wills commenced a partial settlement. The first was for the wife to be his sole beneficiary in the event of her death. The second estate was to be divided into five equal shares. The wife was a distant cousin with whom he had little contact and whose exact whereabouts were unknown. HELD: The Court found that the wife's death was caused by a mixed drug overdose. The Court ordered a single hearing of all issues so that it could avoid repetition of viva voce testimony and duplication of effort.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance."
3,Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. An appeal to this Court lies on any question relating to the Board's jurisdiction or upon any question of law. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipality, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant. 1)Section 85 of the Assessment Act provides that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s.63(6) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions. When such a waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions do not constitute a bar to the board's hearing the appeal. 2)Section 63(3) does not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear an appeal from the Assessment Review Court. That jurisdiction is derived in the first instance in this case from s63(3).","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal."

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to 7 months notice. 1) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 2) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. There is no suggestion in the material that the plaintiff was asked if he was prepared to assume both jobs or if he felt qualified to do so. His unblemished record for the previous six years confirms that he was not necessarily prepared for the role which was thrust upon him. 3) In this case, assuming all of the defendant's evidence is true, have to agree with counsel for the plaintiff who characterized the plaintiff's conduct as 'griping' whether it related to Mr. Dust's absences, Mr. Rissling's estimates of time to perform work on Mr. Conner's vehicle, or his comments on the other person's lack of knowledge. 4) In the case of a person in the plaintiff’s position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice periods selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-managed one. The one incident that does not relate to griping; namely, requesting the car washer, whose job it is to clean vehicles, to also clean his on company time, as an isolated incident, has to be regarded as a minor infraction. 5) Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff will be entitled.  6) The Court considers that the defendant bears a reasonable amount of notice to be entitled to.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."

HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions the accused. The assault itself might not fall within the confines of Section 267(2) in that being semi-conscious or unconscious, they are closely related in time and otherwise. 2) The accused did cause bodily harm even though it was the truck that actually killed the victim. The Crown did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused bodily harm. The accused is responsible for all of the results of the assault which he committed, no matter how unforeseen or how unintentional.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm."
6,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. Accordingly, the appellant is essentially asking this court to set aside the trial's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence, and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages."

The original recovery order was obtained pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08. It contained 85 paragraphs primarily responding to the affidavit filed by the respondent in relation to the house construction and stated that his three earlier affidavits were prepared in his capacity as president and chief executive officer of the company. The second affidavit, dated January 19, attached copies of the Statement of Claim and Defence and the third affidavit attached the pleadings and confirmed that the respondent was the owner of the property and that the third container was to be re-routed back to Canada. The respondent appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although the affidavit was inadmissible, the cross-examination could not be used to determine the merits of an interlocutory application.","Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order. Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue.

8,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence on the grounds that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: 1)The accused was an 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second child at the time of the crime. She had no criminal record but was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. The accused was a known drug dealer and lived in the basement suite. She was a friend of the accused's friend, who had been rifling through the suite when she asked him to sell her some drugs. The two of them were armed with tire irons and on receiving the signal from the accused, they forced their way into the apartment along with the victim. The victim was stabbed to death and his door was kicked down and his life was threatened. The offender appealed his sentence to the equivalent of more than ten years imprisonment, arguing that the sentence imposed by the trial judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that a sentence be proportionate, proportionate and not in the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. Appeal allowed; 1)the accused had no previous criminal record and did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of Prodanovic, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and 2)she was doing well in all programs in prison.  3)The victim was a drug dealer who had purchased drugs at the house in question from Dobra Provanovic, sometimes paying with sexual favours. On receiving the Crown's signal, the accused and the third man attacked the victim and knocked him down the stairs to the basement, where he and the other assailant broke down the door to the defendant's suite. The defendant then followed the victim to his suite and assaulted him with a tire iron. The third assailant, who was never identified, also assaulted the victim in the same suite.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."

The applicant also sought an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any potassium sulfate produced at its plant. HELD: 1) The applicant was granted injunty against the respondent. 2) The defendant had no written client list or other written information about the process used by the plaintiff. 3) The plaintiff had not received sufficient assurances that the technology licensed to it by the defendant was efficient enough for its needs. The defendant entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's technology as a possible option for its operation. 4) The defendants entered into an exclusive marketing agreement. The plaintiff made no representations as to the use of the technology. 5) The court was unable to determine whether the defendant had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles known as ion exchange and crystallization. 6) The application was dismissed with costs of the application. 7) The Court was of the view that the plaintiff had no contractual or other relationship with the defendant.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."
10,Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application by the defendant for an order setting aside default judgment pursuant to Rule 12.06. The originating notice (action) and statement of claim were issued and judgment entered against the defendant on October 18th, 2000. An execution order was issued and the defendant's wages garnisheed. The defendant's claim is that Mr. MacLean's dog ran onto the Conrod Settlement Road in front of the plaintiffts motor vehicle forcing the vehicle into the ditch with resultant damage and that the accident was caused by his negligence in keeping his dog under control. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not given any reasons for not filing a defence in this proceeding other than his assertion that the originating notice was not served on him. He did not recall the circumstances of the particular service.  2)The test to be applied in an application to set aside a default judgment is well established. In Ives v. Dewar (1948), 1948 CanLII 275 (NS CA), the test is whether the defendant has a fairly arguable defence or is there a substantial issue between the parties to be tried.","The respondent entered a default judgment against the applicant and issued an Execution Order. The applicant applied to have the default judgment set aside on the basis that the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim were never served upon him. Application dismissed; on the evidence the documents were served upon the applicant; even though the experienced process server had no independant recollection of service, he swore an affidavit of service which was accepted.

The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.

12,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties which was effective October 1, 1999 and expires September 30, 2002. The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the hotel since 1989 in various capacities. At the time of the grievance, she was employed in the front desk department. Her return had not resulted in a reduction of hours for employees with less departmental seniority than she. She was the first to experience a reduction in her work hours when she took the job. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation at hand and that her conclusion ascribes meaning to that clause which its words cannot reasonably bear and which interpretation was apparently not even argued before her at the arbitration hearing. Although there is clear evidentiary support for her essential findings of fact, it is impossible to determine the extent to which the arbitrator erred in interpreting the provisions.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made."

The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.

The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992. They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement. One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003. The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years. HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated. He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped. He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999. Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support."

HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The accused's respiratory problems did not make it impossible for the accused to provide a sample. 2) Even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. There remained sufficient time in the circumstances surrounding the detention to afford the accused a further opportunity to attempt to consult counsel. 3) The police hastiness does not change the fact that the detainee's right to counsel was violated. The reasons therefor make it understandable and are relevant when one addresses the s.24(2) issue. In my view, the admission of the evidence would not, having regard to all of the circumstances, bring the administration of justice into the hands of the accused.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive."

The respondent was the owner of the vehicle under a vehicle registration certificate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made Ms. Clayton aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11/2001 to November 14/2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The Credit Union sought to defeat this security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and was always in possession of it. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. In the special circumstances of this matter, the Court declined to order costs of either motion.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion."

HELD: 1) The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the Will. 2) Clause 11 does not describe a contrary intention. In that clause, J.D. underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. 3) All of the inheritances which leave to my children and grandchildren and Maureen Banyard belong solely and absolutely to them and is not to form part of matrimonial assets. 4) The provision of Section 31 which prevents lapse in the case of gift to the child or other issue of testator makes it unnecessary to consider whether the intention is not clear from the Will and adopts the 'rules of construction'. 5) The Court must ascertain the ordinary meaning of the words used in light of the surrounding circumstances.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."

HELD: 1) Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, the petitioner sought to set aside the agreement she made with her husband. She did so on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered the agreement. Her claim was based on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability.  2) The only question remaining is whether this court has jurisdiction to hear the petitioner's claim for divorce and her claim for division of property under the Matrimonial Property Act. Since it would appear that Mr. and Mrs. Walker had their last common habitual residence in Ontario, the division of matrimonial assets would be governed by Ontario law.","The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets.

At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand, whether the officer's determination that the accused had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: The Court dismissed the accused's application to exclude the Certificate of Analyses based upon a breach of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The wording of the section does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. The absence of any reference to alcohol in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist."

The father had been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of a conviction for child abuse. D. lived with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area. The mother lived with the paternal grandmother in New Brunswick. She had thirteen children and had the care of her son in an unsupervised situation. She was better set up in her home to receive the child. There was an indication baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and she would move to the city if she got custody. Both parties agreed that the child was in need of protective services. An order was made under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the mother who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them."

The defendants counterclaim for the sum of $56,000 for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. HELD: 1) The delay in this case is full nine years after the cause of action arose. There is no evidence that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the parties had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. The plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for some 9 years. 2) Limitation of Actions Act s.3(e) requires that the action must be commenced within 6 years after any such action arises. 3) This is a contractual matter which, under S. (1) (e) of the Limitation Of Actions Act purports to give the trial judge wide discretion in disallowing defence based upon the prescribed limitation periods as matter of course. In the Random House Dictionary, 2nd Ed discretion is defined as 'The power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgement'. It will generally be less equitable for limitation defence to defeat the claim of diligent plaintiff than one who has sat back on his rights.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel."

The Divorce Judgment shall be granted on the grounds set forth in s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act in that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses have lived separate and apart for more than a year. Her financial needs require such support. Her position deteriorated as a result of her marriage and her financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue. She requested that the court order the husband to comply pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Agreement and purchase her an automobile pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The husband argued that his financial situation was such that he could not continue to provide such support for an indefinite period of time. The wife argued that she had not established any disadvantages arising from the marriage, but there were disadvantages related to its breakdown. HELD: The Court concluded that the wife was entitled to spousal child support at separation and that such entitlement continues. The obligation to pay such support as outlined in the Agreement was clearly reviewable by the parties. The Court found the evidence supported a conclusion it was only for one year.","The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending."

Even at the higher level, it would have been difficult to maintain the same lifestyle. 2) The respondent was required to pay child support of $25,000 to the Maintenance Enforcement Program. 3) It would not be practical to require the respondent to wait for his equity on the precarious condition that the children would be able to raise an additional $35,000 through mortgage renewal when she is ten years older and may or may not be employed.","The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home."

The respondent was a dependent child at the time of the accident, having attained the age of majority and not continuing with his studies or having firm plans to do so. He continued to suffer from his injuries, required close supervision and was unable to work or further his education. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The judge clearly understood that the child was not intending to work permanently but was taking a hiatus to pursue post-secondary studies. The future ability to 'withdraw from parental charge' was unknown. The court was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and depart from it.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."

He testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his evidence on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were substantial. She ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found that the judge misapprehended the evidence by failing to give proper effect to it.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."

The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the action. Defence counsel argued that the plaintiff ought not to be successful in her application for a summary judgment because she has not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. HELD: Judgment was entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed.  1) It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of an order of interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. This might ultimately be for a Trial Judge at an assessment of damages. 2) An order for interim payment is not mandatory. It is discretionary Order of the Chambers Judge. 3) In cases where there is considerable uncertainty existing as to what is likely to be recovered by the plaintiff, the proper approach is that where the Court is faced with such a degree of uncertainly, it should conclude that it is unable to make a determination of what will be recovered in those damage areas of uncertainty. 4) An application under Rule 33.01(A) is not a trial or mini trial where an estimate of the plaintiff's ultimate recovery can be difficult and may amount to nothing more than a haphazard guess. In such cases the Court should refrain from making an order.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages."

Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne.

The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to the plaintiff and her husband, and argue that in fact it was an investment by them into the auto broking business known as Auto Brokers 1999. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no evidence that the plaintiff loaned money to either of the defendants. Some of the payments made by the plaintiff to the defendant and/or his company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd. were made in her sole name. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was dismissed on the basis that the defendant had not advanced any money to her personally. 3)The defendant was not a shareholder and director of this corporation.","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant."

The respondent challenged the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed and quashed the warrant. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which must be addressed in light of the totality of the circumstances. The trial judge did not substitute his view of the evidence for that of the issuing judge, which was an error of law.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."

The wife argued that she was entitled to a share of the proceeds from the sale of the home. She also sought an order for the respondent to return certain personal belongings. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for a rehearing on an expedited basis. 1) There was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. It was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking the value of the house, and the parties' individual contributions to that value into account when then classifying, quantifying and dividing matrimononial assets. 2) The court found no reason why the matter could not be heard again by the judge should his schedule permit it.

There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value."
38,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The plaintiffs were involved in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was operating a police vehicle at the time of the accident when the plaintiff's vehicle was struck by another vehicle. The plaintiff was wearing a seat belt when the accident occurred. She said she turned on her headlights when she saw the police vehicle approaching the intersection. She testified that she did not see the vehicle in front of her but that she thought the lights were on in the vehicle. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff was contributory negligent in failing to observe the accident from the time she entered the vehicle until the accident scene. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the defendant had lost control of his vehicle when he turned the lights on. It was also found there was insufficient evidence to establish that the plaintiffs' headlights were in operation when they entered the accident.,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."

The search warrant alleged that the applicant filed fraudulent T4 and created a false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been used as a basis for the search warrant. The applicant claimed the judge ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue the warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias and depriving the applicant of natural justice. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant's own evidence supported the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. 2)The application for leave to appeal was dismissed on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support the warrant application. 3)The issues were whether there was reasonable apprehension or reasonable apprehension as to bias.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."
40,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The parties were married for 17 years. They separated in 2004 after the petitioner petitioned for divorce and the Respondent filed a counter-petition. The parties had four children. The oldest child resided with his mother when she was attending university. The youngest child lived with his father when he was working part-time. The mother was the primary caregiver and the father provided for the children's education. The wife worked full-time as a daycare worker. She was also the primary child carer. The husband was employed with the federal government and drove a cab on weekends. The two older children lived with the mother when they were not attending university and the parties' home was far from complete. HELD: The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the children to be placed in the custody and primary care of their mother. There was no evidence that the children had any preference as to where they should live. The Court gave effect to the principle that the child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with their best interests and take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors."
41,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The Defence position was that he should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a danger to the public because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour, which showed a reasonable possibility of causing death or injury to other persons, and a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his behaviour. The Court reviewed the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which made it clear that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender and long term offender provisions, there must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated within a definite period of time. This is especially true where the offender does not suffer from an inherent defect of character or reason.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."

HELD: The Court found that the father was the primary caregiver for the child and that the mother's role in the child's life was to be shared with the mother. The Court also found that there was insufficient evidence to support the father’s claim for independent access to the child.,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access."

HELD: 1) The plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the defendant. The defendant has been on medical leave for over 2 years at the time of responding on July 14, 1999. At that time he remained qualified at Level 1. Any training or upgrading could possibly relate solely to a prolonged period of absence from the medical practice. In those circumstances, the answer to questions and may not be particularly relevant to these proceedings. 2) It is the position of the plaintiffs that they require particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of the defendant in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. His performances both before and after the surgery performed on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, they claim, are relevant to that issue. The plaintiffs maintain that they are not seeking documents relating to the inquiries or reviews, only factual information. 3) The Court is limited to looking at the claim and particulars provided, if any, when deciding whether to strike paragraphs pursuant to Rule 173(a). 4) The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated and punitive damages. Punitive damages are awarded in situations not related to the subject litigation.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."
44,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was in the passenger seat and crossed to the driver's seat of an idling vehicle to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. He testified that he was quite intoxicated and was too impaired to be driving. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver’s seat but did not intend to drive the vehicle. There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind.,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."
45,Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The Crown applied to have the complainant's oral statements admitted into evidence as an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence. The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. The court found that the test of necessity has been met. The evidence supports the inference that the statements made by the complainant are admissible because certain aspects of that statement were independently verified.,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."

The issues were whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing and whether the landlord could refuse to grant an order for possession when there was an outstanding order. HELD: The matter was remitted for rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) Section 47(5.1) permits the landlord to order that service is sufficient, even if not in compliance with the Act, to be able to terminate and take possession of the rental premises. The issue of service on Ivy and Richie was never considered by the Rentalsmans. 2) Section 60(5) permits a landlord or tenant to order service of and notice to all tenants. There is nothing in the decision that would permit the landlord's assertion that it did not have notice of this hearing.  3) Section 20 of The Residential Tenancies Act permits either landlord to terminate a monthly tenancy. Section 25(1) allows either tenant to terminate monthly tenancy but only if the tenant has signed a written lease. The tenant was not given any written notification of any breach and therefore the landlord had not complied with the legislation. 4) Section 50(2)(c) of The Act permits the tenant to give notice of termination of a tenancy without any cause. The only reason given to this hearing was because of improper parking and the Tenants were not doing that anymore. It would not seem fair to evict on those grounds alone.","This is an appeal by the landlord pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman who, pursuant to s. 47 of the Act dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession. HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman. The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants."

The issue before the court was whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children. HELD: 1) What, if any, retroactive support should be ordered in this matter? 2) What is the father's share of both childcare costs and Sylvan Learning Centre costs in addition to his s. child support amount?  3) What spousal support should not affect the right of the mother to pursue the issue of retroactive child support in the future.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."

Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1) The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's Charter rights. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the accused to speak. The recording was not conscriptive evidence in the sense described in Stillman. 2) Even if there was a breach of s8, such evidence was considered non-conscriptive and ought not to be excluded pursuant to s24(2). The evidence obtained pursuant to an authorization granted in relation to the investigation of an offence under s. 271(1) was not a charge listed in the definition section nor a section that creates an offence. The accused relied upon the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stillman, supra, for 'automatic exclusion' without engaging the weighing process outlined in s. 24(1). The accused argues that such an intention amounts to pure speculation and falls short of what could be considered to be reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought. 3) There was no Charter breach and the evidence was in fact admissible and ought to be admitted. 4) The seriousness of the breach was minimal and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

They may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred.

HELD: 1) There is a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089, which says that if a will is prepared in circumstances raising justifiable suspicion that it does not reflect the mind and wish of a testator, then it is for those who propound the will to overcome the suspicion. This is not to say the propounder need prove negative that the testatory was not induced by undue influence to sign the will but the court must scrutinize the evidence closely in light of the suspicion to determine whether undue influence ought to be drawn. 2) All the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial of the foregoing issues including the Rules pertaining to disclosure, production of documents, examinations for discovery and pretrial conference. There was no other discussion about beneficiaries and she did not ask about giving money to any other family members or individuals. 3) The testator is to bear the burden of proof with respect to the alleged undue influence. 4) It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses.","The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator. HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered."

A temporary guardianship order was issued in Alberta. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child in 2005, the respondents temporarily re-located to Calgary and put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. On the same day that the order was granted, it was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order under which the respondents became the guardians of the child not in the permanent care of an agency (subject to limited exceptions). HELD: The appeal was allowed and the adoption application was remitted to a judge of the Family Division. The mother's bona fide intention to appear or be represented was reasonably capable of belief; the steps she took to engage counsel were reasonable in the circumstances and she acted with dispatch. The court would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing (paras 6, 7 and 8) and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. Clearly the due diligence requirement is not applicable here.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.

The Respondent was the respondent's spouse within the meaning of the legislation and the Pension Benefits Standards Act and was not the biological mother of the applicants. The applicant failed to respond to the notice on the original date for hearing. She therefore necessitated a second date. The applicants were entitled to costs for the second day but these were offset by the expense she caused the Applicants on the first date.,"The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.

The judge on appeal had jurisdiction to make an order that both returned the child to the custody of the parent and had him remain in the care of the minister for a temporary period. The Minister appealed the order. HELD: Leave was granted or withheld on considerations of merit and importance. The issue was of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal. The governing criteria may be reduced to two-each of which features a subset of considerations rather than fixed rules, that they are case sensitive, and their point by point reduction is not exhaustive. The court found the issue of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the court, or to the field of practice or the state of the law, to warrant determination.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy had not been converted into a monthly to month lease because the landlord refused to give his consent in a timely manner. The practical effect of either possible result could be work hardship on either side. The tenant was entitled to make a reasonable business decision and not be second guessed by tenants, Residential Tenancies Officers or Adjudicators simply because they do not agree with the landlord. The legal result must flow from the decision.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."

The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care.,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them."

The plaintiffs applied for certification. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased the Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The plaintiff sought to have the action against itself struck for failure to produce a proper representative plaintiff. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff could not rely on s. 14 prior to certification of the action as a class action. The Court dismissed the application for examination on the Red Seal affidavit. 1) The Court found that there had not been any previous cases in which a plaintiff was allowed to cross examine a defendant on an affidavit. 2) It was important to note that the wording of s14 and s24 of the Act in my view precludes this type of pre certification notice. 3) There was no reference by the Court to s14 or 24 of the class action Act. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding the preliminary conflict objection. 4) The court was not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow the plaintiff to make the requested order for disclosure of the names of the nine property owners.,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction."

The appellant argued that the hearing judge erred in holding that the income replacement benefit payable during the post 180 day period pursuant to s.117(1) and (3) of the Act is not to be less than the income substitute benefit payable for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to the Act. HELD: The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. The IRB calculation was correct. The respondent's IRB was reduced by 90% to determine his net income. The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' employed by SGI beyond advancing an interpretation of s. 117(4) that is inconsistent with the weighted average approach used by the SGI. As the respondent had not been successful in this proceeding, he was not entitled to any more costs.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality."

The appellant assumed a substantial portion of the respondent's support. The respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was still feeling effects of her illnesses but could in my view do some part-time employment. She did not appear capable of full time employment. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis that she was over 18 without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge."

S. Smith on February 2, 2007. The petitioner seeks that the parenting judgment be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance since the last parenting order was made. The respondent has provided generous access to the petitioner since the birth of the twins. 2) The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him in this regard. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; if the applicant is unable to show the existence of material change, the inquiry can go no farther: Wilson v. Grassick (1994), 1994 CanLII 4709 (SK CA), R.F.L. (4th) 291 (Sask. C.A.). 11) What evidence is there to establish material change in the situation of the child means that an application to vary custody cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order. The child's 2009 income is $77,942.41 less union dues of $882 which establishes his Guideline income for 2009 at $77.060 which results in monthly child support obligation pursuant to the original order of $1072 per month for the twins and $420 is to be paid within 30 days.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs."

The landlord also appealed the hearing officer's findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) It is open to the Hearing officer to accept some of the evidence of a particular witness and not other evidence of that witness. The Hearing Officer is not bound to accept all evidence told to her by the witness. 2) The grounds set out in the landlord's appeal relate to the findings of facts made by the Hearing Office. The tenant's appeal relates to the hearing Officer's finding of facts related to her claim for reimbursement of one-half of the utilities. 3) The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction. This appellate function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal. Only when there is no relevant supporting evidence is the line between a valid non-appealable finding and an invalid appealable finding crossed.","The applicant landlord appeals from a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office, which ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $787.13.

The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others."

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The Court found that the accused was not guilty of the offence of common assault because the complainant had not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred.,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

The accused was detained for 11 minutes and a breathalyzer demand was made. At the police station, the accused was arbitrarily detained for that period of time and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. The officer placed the accused in the police vehicle because he was investigating a possible drunk driving charge but also because it was cold outside and the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. 2) The Court found that the accused's right to counsel was not breached. 3) The delay was of a relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel. 4) The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. 5) In R. v. Ritchie, [2010] SKCA 13, the Court held that once breath samples are provided under s. 254(3), the officer's grounds for demanding the samples are irrelevant. 6) Section 254(2) gives authority to a police officer to demand a breath sample for analysis at the roadside, if certain conditions are met. The police officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did can form reasonable grounds for the admission of the evidence.  7) There is no rule with respect to the exact number of minutes which must elapse before the demand falls outside the 'forthwith' requirement.  8) There was little in the accused’s testimony upon which to determine the impact of the breach on the Charter protected interests of the accused. He testified that he was unaware of how long he waited for the officer to call Legal Aid. He was not advised of the reason for his detention. 8) The court found the accused should have been given an opportunity to contact Legal Aid duty counsel. 9) The certificate of analysis was admitted.  10) The defence argued that because the officer did not inform the accused of the reasons for the detention, he should not have been provided with the opportunity to consult counsel.  11) The time line for completion was within the parameters set forth in Ritchie and the delay was 11 minutes.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.

The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The Crown appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge was required to address s.2 of the Criminal Code with respect to the definition of a weapon. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as such. The categories of lay opinion evidence, as with the opinion evidence of experts, are not closed. The weight of the evidence is for the trier of fact. 2)The Crown argues that a sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, the Crown suggests that the Crown required special qualifications that would justify his opinion; that the blade was properly the subject of expert evidence put in under the guise of opinion evidence; and that the switch-blade has a useful contrast: there is no apparent normal, peaceful use to be served by a sword. 3)The judge properly placed the evidence in the context of the issues she had to address.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.

The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. HELD: The Interlocutory Injunction was granted. 1)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the Plaintiff company - the loss of customers, or market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test.  2)The applicant was facing a serious threat to its business and it had reasonable argument that this Court should examine the situation and perhaps intervene.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April.

The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence.,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath, and the appellant’s claim for breach of the Charter must fail. 2) There was no evidence that the police officer observed the bloodshot eyes of appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 3) The evidence was not clear that the officer observed what type of footwear the appellant was wearing. The defence made the point that if he had been wearing flip flops, that footwear may have caused him to walk awkwardly or stumble. The appellant was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night as well as all the indicia of impairment referenced above. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot, the remaining indicia which Cst.

The court of appeal would have jurisdiction to prohibit a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench from making any change to his or her own judgment even though the judge is not functus officio.,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement.

The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The judge was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. He gave more than adequate reasons for questioning the foundation of the assessments. This finding, combined with his review of all of the evidence, was more than sufficient to support his conclusion that there was no'reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community'. 2) The court dismissed the appeal. The judge did not fail to take adequate consideration of the expert's findings.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal."

The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."

The parties were disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each had made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. The applicant failed to establish there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally, to warrant a determination by the Court of Appeal.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The defendant was entitled to damages as against the plaintiff for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment. The plaintiff could have made a loan to the defendant. There was no record of it as far as loan documentation went. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant Lilia if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada.  1) The defendant had agreed to these payments being paid back to the plaintiff. 2) Lilia's testimony as to working four hours for November, at $15.00 an hour, was not supported by the evidence that supports that these payments were not consented to and agreed to. 3) The plaintiff should have been paid $480 for her 32 hours worked in December and in addition should have received $417.68 for vacation pay. This totals $897.68.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance."
76,Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine. He was bound by a youth probation order based on a conviction of possession for the use of cocaine. One of the terms of that probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had permission of the Court. The accused was sentenced to six months deferred custody and supervision. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38(c).","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."
77,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The defendants applied for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendants. The defendants applied to stay the proceedings pending the decision of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the application for certification of the BC Action. HELD: The applications were dismissed. The court found that the application was discretionary and that cross-examination on what they have been told, and about their individual opinions related to the qualities of their respective counsel, would not add to the evidentiary record. The application was dismissed. It is unacceptable for legal counsel to present argument in the form of an affidavit, but it does not follow that by doing so, the affiant lawyer becomes obliged to open up his or her client files for review by third parties, nor examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross examination.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."

HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so, and any implied waiver could be restricted to material relating to the formulation of the expressed opinion. The Court found that when an expert takes the witness stand or an expert's report is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver of information in the expert's file which is foundational to the opinion.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers."

The parties married in 2008 and separated in April 2011. The mother wanted to change her residence (and that of their two young children) presently, which amounts to an application to change residence on an interim basis. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: 1) The mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. Her ability to act as parent to her two existing children will necessarily be impacted by the arrival of a third child. There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour. This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. Her willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a significant factor in her remaining the primary parent. The move is not for a job, nor for any other sort of economic opportunity. He does not presently (nor in the near future) present a viable parenting alternative. In any event, the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. 2) There was nothing suggesting the children had anything other than a close and loving relationship with the mother.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time."

The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1)The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. The trial judge's comments and interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the trial judge could understand it. The proper test is whether his conduct denied the defendant a fair trial or gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 2)The appellant had the necessary experience in respect to foundation and structural repair that he could give expert evidence as to not only the type of structural repair but also the need for structural repair. 3)The respondent was self-represented. He was entitled to give his opinion evidence.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation."
81,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court of Appeal dismissed the College's application for leave to hear an appeal from decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The College argued that the Psychologists Act 'confers only a limited right of appeal' within the meaning of s7(2)(a) of the Act and that it was not relevant to the resolution of the issues in this application. Section 7(2) is subject to the need to obtain leave with respect to interlocutory decisions and to the two exceptions contained in s. 7(3) and s. 33 of The Interpretation Act, which are to establish the jurisdiction, powers and duties of this Court and its judges.  1) The Psychologist Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of a Court of the Queen’s Bench or a judge of that Court. This meaning is supported by the objectives and purposes of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc immediately prior to the first day of March, 1918 and by consideration of what s. 14(3)(a)(i) of The Psychology Act means that it is a general, albeit ambiguous, right of appeals conferred by s. of The Courtof Appeal Act, 1978 and its predecessors. 2) The psychologists Act did not provide that the legislature can take away the right of an appeal conferred in s 7(1) in an enactment, but that does not limit the member's right on appeal from that Court to this one. This is the object of the right, the attainment of which we are bound to strive to achieve when construing and interpreting the provisions of the court of appeal. 3) The College was granted a specific right to the Court to appeal. It was necessary to consider on a case-by-case basis whether the Court had jurisdiction derived from a complex matrix of sources and whether an enactment would overturn such decisions.","HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench."
82,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court held that the plaintiff's amended claim was frivolous or vexatious and that he had no legal right to bring the application. The Court also held that an injunction ordering a fence to be built was beyond the authority of the Court and that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of the neighbourhood predating the plaintiff’s purchase of the property and that “having regard for the requisite elements and considerations to be applied... the claimant has not been able to demonstrate that the fir trees amount to nuisance”. It is noted there was significant amount of evidence from expert reports relating to fir tree growth patterns and the effect it can have on one's health. The court held that one who chooses to live in a semi-rural environment where there are a significant number of trees must expect to have both the benefits and advantages of those trees and some of the minor inconveniences that naturally accompany them. HELD: 1) The plaintiff failed to establish what can be regarded as nuisance, that is an inconvenience materially interfering with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence, not merely according to elegant or dainty modes and habits of living, but according to plain and simple notions. Whether damages can be claimed or would be awarded for this is a question to be decided at trial.  2) Taking into account all of the factors and considerations as they relate to this case and the Claimant's proffered complaints, the Court was prepared to strike the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the Sykes' property onto the Labuick property. Even if the plaintiff could prove that the debris in his yard is solely from the trees, this would not be sufficient.","The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space."

The Court found that the trial judge erred in failing to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow a review of recently disclosed documents. The court also found that there was no direct evidence linking the accused to trafficking in cocaine or conspiring to traffic in cocaine. The Crown had not disclosed the existence of the documents and, in the circumstances, the court was not in a position to assess whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was ordered.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."
84,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: Application allowed. 1) The appellant was ordered to pay ongoing spousal support of $10,000 per month and exclusive possession of the family home. The respondent was also ordered to file garnishees to collect those arrears.  2) There was no evidence to support the Chambers judge’s finding that he stopped paying the bills for his family home at the end of October 2015 and that that in fact was not the case. 3) The respondent had been paying ongoing support (spousal and child) of $12,726 per month for the past 3 years. She had taken out her sousa from the line of credit after the separation.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."
85,Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The accused was charged with possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. A search warrant was issued and the accused was taken into custody. During the course of his examination-in-chief, the accused went to some length to differentiate the peer-to-peer file sharing network from the centralized server model. The accused requested an opportunity to consult with counsel of his choice. The officer advised the accused that he would like to be able to answer any technical questions that he might have concerning the file sharing program. The evidence showed that the accused had access to three computers, one of which was a laptop computer, the other a desktop computer, and the third one was a red tower custom built computer. The computer was not locked and the search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex. The court was not satisfied with the officer's assessment that the computer was the same and therefore could not be accessed by the accused.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt."
86,Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. The Court ordered a judicial stay of proceedings. The accused was to appear in bail court on all charges. The court ordered the personal attendance of the accused on the dates set out in s. 11(b) of the Charter. The Charter application was granted and the preliminary hearing was scheduled for September 12 15, 2016. The trial was to take one full day.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable."
87,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not violated. The evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count 2. The police officer did not have the ASD with him when he stopped the accused because he turned off the street he was driving on to what appeared to be a 'goat trail'. The breathalyzer did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused indicated that he had just had a beer and that he wanted to call a lawyer. The officer had his back turned and he actually went to another room for a brief time leaving the accused unattended.,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings."
88,Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, had published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in the Star Phoenix newspaper and websites owned and operated by the newspaper and its parent company, Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation as a result of the publication of these articles. The defendants sought an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites controlled by them. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed this request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that no party will suffer actual prejudice as a consequence of the requested amendment.","HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages."
89,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equated to $10,902.32.  1)The Court accepted that in the absence of an express term in the contract, which the parties agreed to pay in accordance with the terms articulated by the plaintiff, the defendant was not free to charge whatever it chooses to charge. 2)The court was not satisfied that the defendant's failure to identify precisely why they were paying some accounts, but not others after November of 2015, would be evidence of the estoppel by convention that the plaintiff seeks to advance. 3)The plaintiff had received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought but not entirely. The defendant asked that it grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair price.","HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work."
90,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This action was brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. Fossil was the principal officer of Fossil and incorporated it for the purpose of becoming involved with Tudex. The dismissal of the Fossil's action effectively releases Tudex from any further obligation under the contract. The repudiation of the contract by Tudex is legitimized. An order for rescission is not necessary. The claim of the plaintiff that there has been a breach by the TUDEX entitling it to damages must be denied. In its counterclaim Tudex seeks rescission, not only of contract of June 2, 1981 but also of the agreement relating to the market study. HELD: The claim for judgment for $56,500 and damages is dismissed. 1)The letter of September 18 effectively did that. The letter of the 18th letter was legitimized by virtue of the fact that Tudex, having accepted the performance of the Tudex on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor, there is no basis for a rescission of contract pertaining thereto. 2)A mutual mistake existed. The defendant thought Fossil, through Lovell, was to bring in investment capital and the T.L. memo enclosed by Crooks with the letter enclosed by the letter did not confirm that. 3)A case for award of damages was not made out on the evidence. 4)The claim for $31,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescission was disallowed. 5)The fact that a reasonable bystander could not infer a contract conditional upon Lovell acquiring investment capital for Tudex was not an irresistible inference to be made.","The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore."

94,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This appeal concerned the interpretation of s. 4 of the standard form lease, N.S. Regulation 270/87 made pursuant to s. 26 of the Residential Tenancies Act and certain sections of the Rent Review Act. The tenants entered into a year to year lease in 1989. The rent provided for in the lease was $500 per month. The lease was automatically renewed at the expiration of the lease unless either the landlord or the tenant had provided at least three months notice to terminate prior to the date of renewal. Despite the specific provision with respect to rent payable contained in a lease, the rent was raised from $500 to $515 per month effective May 1, 1990. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted albeit apparently S.C.A. No. 02392 in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease."

This was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications for the processing of pickled herring and included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The equipment was used in the manufacture or production of the product and was exempt from tax. The appellant argued that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration unit in full. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services was upheld. 1)In order to be eligible for exemption from tax under s10(1)(h)(I) it is appropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process. 2)In this case, the appellant was awarded its costs.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."

This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the court. Although the appellant submits there were extenuating circumstances in his favour that should have detracted from his conviction, there is nothing that this court can do about that.","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

97,Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The contract allocated the risk for the fire loss to Fraser Brace and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. The appellant issued a builder's risk policy to Fraser- Brace but the policy was never required to carry builder's insurance. The trial judge found that the building was never at the insured's risk and that the policy issued to the insurer was void. He ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire it had no liability to the Province or Fraser-Bace for causing the loss. In summary, there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. The Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. In this case it never did.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant.

The doctor who had treated the appellant had advised him that he was obliged to report accidents that had not been reported. When the appellant reported the accident to the police, he refused to supply a sample of blood. The trial judge did not err when she found that appellant's s.8 Charter rights were not violated.

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including adivorce, joint custody and an equal division of property. HELD: 1)The petitioner was given leave to return to this Court so that child support may again be considered. 2)The respondent's leave of absence was extended for three years. 3)The parties had a traditional marriage. The parties had two children, Dillon and Levi. The petitioner had re-entered the workforce after many years absence. Clearly, she suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. She had employment which she believed would within a few years enable her to become financially self-sufficient. It was the petitioner's responsibility to assist her in achieving this goal. The Matrimonial Property Act provides that the welfare of children should displace the other considerations enumerated in the Act. It is apparent that the children will benefit by living in the matrimononial home for the foreseeable future. If he is going to make such a career move he must first organize his situation in such a manner that he can keep up his obligation to his children. What constitutes an extraordinary circumstance has been considered in a number of decisions. The father voluntarily quit his job so he could enrol in a training course that he thought would advance him in the workplace. He is entitled to do that but he is not entitled to pass on to his former wife and children (or to the public purse as it happens in this case) the economic consequence of his decision.  4)The court refused to order costs with respect to the respondent's application for an order for joint custody.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support."

The Crown seeks to use her prior statement as substantive evidence in the trial. HELD: 1)The Crown has satisfied the requirements for substantive use of the statement set out in R. v. K.G.B. on the balance of probabilities that her statement, but for the demonstrably false portion, meets the threshold of reliability. 2)The evidence of the police officer who provided the videotaped statement does not corroborate every aspect of the witness's statement but does so sufficiently, in enough different particulars, that the Court is satisfied on thebalance of probabilities the statement met the threshold for reliability.

She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability."
105,Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The applicant applies for an order that the respondents be prohibited from any further proceedings or actions in relation to a formal complaint against him, dated December 15, 1988, alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor. The court did not deal with a statutory requirement, as is the case before me. This court has the jurisdiction to waive rules but does not have the authority to waive statutory requirements. Accordingly, the Teskey decision is inapplicable to the matter before it. The powers of the respondents to regulate and discipline its members is conferred by statute and as such, am of the view that the exercise of such powers must be complied with strictly. In Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed. (Sweet Maxwell, London, 1969) at p. 245 the author states: Similarly, statutes dealing with jurisdiction and procedure are, if they relate to the infliction of penalties, strictly construed: compliance with procedural provisions will be stringently exacted from those proceeding against the person liable to be penalised, and if there is any ambiguity or doubt it will, as usual, be resolved in his favour. This is so, even though it may enable him to escape upon technicality. Applying s. 27(3) of the Interpretation Act, 1995, conclude that the word'shall' in s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, must be interpreted as imperative. It is mandatory. It was not directory. Disciplinary proceedings expose a member of the Law Society to punishments including suspension of the right to practice and disbarment. The nature of disciplinary proceedings can have devastating effect on the most valuable asset barrister, solicitor and solicitor has his or her reputation. This reinforces my view that s.53 must be strictly interpreted. The duty of respondents is the protection of the rights not only of members of the public but also the members of Law Society of Saskatchewan. This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. Leave is given to speak to costs. 1)The applicant was convicted of one count of theft and two counts of fraud on September 6, 1991.

The charge arose out of an altercation which occurred at Uncle Charlie's Bar in which the accused subdued a penitentiary employee with a headlock and removed him from the bar.

The complainant was restrained by the accused and fell down the steps onto the complainant. He was not drinking on the occasion and did not wish to drink. The defence argued that the complainant was trying to get at the accused while being restrained, and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer abeating to him. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the complainant's self-defence.

Such payments were consistent with the applicants remaining in possession under a month-to-month tenancy following the expiry of their previous sub- lease in 1997. 2) The applicants have not obeyed the requirements of the Act by way of notice of motion. 3) The relocation at no cost to the applicants or VIP is as consistent with an agreement to accommodate the needs of Bennett as with the agreements asserted by the applicants.

Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy."

HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2)."
109,Issue | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Non_IRC Document : ,"The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitation extended from June 1997 until September 18. HELD: 1)The Court found the respondent to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. The Court also found that the respondent's action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner had served his solicitor with her Answer did not result in the parties reconciling their agreement to live separate and apart. It was clear from the answers given by both parties that when they did reunite, their objective was to have their lives fully restored and together. 2)There was no serious argument that they cohabited in 1997. The only issue was for how long. The untrue statements set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to residency, statements that he swore as true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment; and his action in denying the petitioner's application for default judgment were true.","In issue was whether the parties cohabited for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their 1996 separation agreement to live separate and apart. The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge."

The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense.

The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care.

The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in failing to properly apply the principles of negligent misrepresentation as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Queen v.

The agreement provided for each brother to get one-third of the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. HELD: 1)The agreement was interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3rd, 2003, it was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The first way was to include the word'milk' in the definition of a 'quota'. The second way would be to include 'fluid milk'. The third way, to divide proceeds equally among the brothers. 2)The plaintiff was not aware at the time that the agreement only referred to Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was not obligated to share proceeds from the sale of it. 3)The court was not satisfied with the interpretation of the agreement in this case.","The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales.

HELD: 1)Questions directed at whether insurance was obtained and if so who arranged and paid for the same were not admissible at trial. 2)Questions on the availability of alternative forms of transportation, the cost of such alternatives, the reliability or safety of the alternatives were not relevant. 3)Questions regarding the status of the plaintiff's insurance policy were not asked at this time. 4)Questions about whether the plaintiff knew or ought to have known that the helicopter shuttle service was unsafe were not questions to be answered. 5)Questions relating to the other six theories were clearly irrelevant as they were not raised by the pleadings. 6)The plaintiff was entitled to discovery of a document or record if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead to train of inquiry which may have either or these consequences.","FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed."

As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments to proceed.  2) The applicant was a joint owner of the property and should have been included in the original action. The fact she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. The material filed does not establish inexcusable delay. 3) The defendant's claim that it has suffered actual prejudice is not accepted. 4) The application is allowed. The court reviewed the relevant requirements of the Limitation of Actions Act and determined that the Court was constrained by only one rule: he must exercise that unfettered discretion judicially.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act.

The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause."

The defendant argued the Agreement was a lease and that liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of the Tariff of Costs. 1) The agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to pay the final payment. The applicant was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance. 2) It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c). The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The primary incidents of ownership are use of a sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay a capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest in excess of 500 base hours. The parties treated the trade-in as an advance payment even though the value of the trade in does not equal the amount of the advance payment; the difference being $679.33. 3) The central issue is whether the agreement is a lease or a security agreement. The issue was whether the consent by Mr. Poirier to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability because of exclusionary clause eight of the agreement. 4) The parties did canvass the circumstances within the framework of this summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3."

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'."

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. The Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. There had not been a breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of police witnesses during the trial.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied."

The accused was charged with sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and uttering a threat. He had not been gainfully employed since that time and had been dependent on social assistance for his subsistence. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the Recognizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact. It would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture.,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence."
124,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"The appellant and the respondent lived together in a 'common law relationship' for ten years. Two children were born out of the relationship. The respondent and the appellant separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. HELD: Appeal allowed; s. 15(1) declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect; declaration suspended for 12 months per reasons. 1) This is a case where the pre-existing spousal relationship was in all ways a traditional and fairly long term relationship. Persons involved in an unmarried relationship constitute an historically disadvantaged group. There is ample evidence that unmarried partners have often suffered social disadvantage and prejudice. The Supreme Court of Canada concluded that she had no legal right to any share of it on a marriage breakdown. The injustice of this state of affairs led provincial and territorial governments to consider legislative reform of matrimonial property law. 2) The Court assumed the facts to be as follows (and these assumptions are not challenged on this appeal): 1) marital status touches the essential dignity and worth of the individual in the same way as other recognized grounds of discrimination violative of fundamental human rights norms. It touches the individual's freedom to live life with the mate of one's choice in the fashion that one chooses. It is not a matter which should be excluded from Charter consideration on the ground that its recognition would trivialize the equality guarantee.  2) There can be different conceptions of what human dignity means. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, has been revealed as inadequate at both practical and psychological level. The reality may be otherwise. The sanction of the union by the state through civil marriage cannot always be obtained. Changes in the law; the reluctance of the one's partner to marry; financial, religious or social constraints '‑ these factors commonly function to prevent partners who otherwise operate as family unit from formally marrying. In short, marital status often lies beyond the extent of an effective control. The dramatic increase in divorce rate after 1968 was undoubtedly the principal factor motivating the need to find 'orderly and equitable' ways to settle ex-spouses' financial affairs. For several decades after its adoption, separate property worked reasonably well in large majority of cases.","The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter."

The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. She was found guilty of possession of the drug and the other charge against her was stayed. HELD: 1) Section 20(4) does not require the accused to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt or on balance of probabilities her innocence of any complicity in the designated substance offence or that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to have been used in the commission of the offence. 2) The societal purpose of the Act, and the forfeiture provisions thereof, was alluded to by Whitman J.A. in R. v. Gisby, 2000 ABCA 261 (CanLII), [2000] A.J. No. 1145 QL (Alta. C.A.): [1] The statement that ""there's some evidence that she may have had knowledge of the existence of the marihuana"" was based on the following testimony of Constable Baulkham: p. 44 My Lord, while we were up at the vehicle and we refer to Constable Nash, Ms. Brooks and myself had conversation and do ask a couple of questions if there was any other drugs in the vehicle, and she stated, 'No, just the marijuana'. The only other comment recall her making was, 'Just in the blue tubs'. 3) The forfeiture provisions attach a very real cost to the business of drug crime directly equivalent to the monetary value of offence-related property that is subject to forfeiture, thus raising the stakes associated with the Commission of those offences. 4) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(4), however, because Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S20(4). 5) There was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the foregoing testimony. 6) The interest in the property of a person who has neither been convicted nor charged with the offence will not be affected if the person 'appears innocent of any involvement' in the crime.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment."

All seven applicants were parents of children attending the two schools and none of the applicants had children attending either school. HELD: 1) The applicants had not been directly affected by the closure of the schools. 2) There was no evidence of any adverse effect on the students in view of the existing vacancies. 3) The applicant obtained standing for different reasons the judicial discretion to find he had public interest standing. There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion.  4) The respondents raised an issue of standing with respect to the application. The applicants raised a concern about the allocation of scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the mere busybody. The applicant did not have a direct personal interest in the issue before the court.,"The applicants applied for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the school board to close two schools. The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools., application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure. The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the owner was in contempt of the Consent Order and ordered that he comply with all requirements of the order. The Court ordered that the court issue a contempt order against the owner. The owner was ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $25,000 to the sheriff for failure to comply with the order and to provide an updated copy of the lease to the Development Officer each time it was altered in any way. A fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution as the owner complied with all of the requirements.","The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The material does not satisfy the Court there has been any material change in the respondent's circumstances. The respondent says his mother does not have the means but there is no evidence in this regard. The situation is somewhat akin to that where a payor, particularly the self-employed, claim his or her income has changed substantially. The onus is on the individual to provide cogent, and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. It is evident from the affidavit material filed by both parties that there is a substantial and ongoing conflict between them which affects their ability to make arrangements with respect to the parenting provisions in the consent judgment. As a result there will be an order requiring a spouse to pay for the support of any or all children in the marriage. This order will be made pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Act including basic support in a table amount based upon the imputed income. The alternative is that it is simply an agreed upon amount that differs from the amount that would be determined in accordance with the guidelines. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1) The Court found that it was not necessary to determine which of these alternate approaches constitutes the basis of the consent judgement as the material question before the Court at this time is the same in both instances. If the parties agreed to impute income the respondent has the onus of satisfying the Court that a material change has occurred since the making of the child support order or the last variation order made in respect of that order. There has been no material change to the circumstances of the children. 2) The respondent's taxable income in 1998 was $43,209.40. In 2000 it was $44,386.00. In making the variation order, the court shall take into consideration only the best interests of that child as determined by reference to that change. The Guidelines 3.(1) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, the amounts of child support","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children."

The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1) The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injury suffered. 2) The plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. 3) There have been many cases that have found slippery substances such as water or produce on a floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the defendant did not know the floor was cleaned at that time but did know that water and other substances could be in the vicinity of where the plaintiff fell. 4) An adverse inference can be drawn when, in the absence of an explanation, a party fails to adduce the evidence of a witness who would have knowledge of the facts and who would be assumed to be willing to assist that party. 5) There were many cases where the defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiffs. The judicial authorities have most often based the duty upon the invitor/invitee standard.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances."

He appeals his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. When the correct standard as enunciated in R. v. Hundal is applied to the evidence found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate. 1) The evidence did not support a guilty verdict for dangerous driving. 2) It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused intended to collide with the automobile driven by the appellant in order to prove the offence. The law doesn't require any longer than 18 months to establish a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those particular circumstances. The trial judge made a number of findings of fact. In doing so, he gave the benefit of any reasonable doubt to the accused. At the same time, he accepted the evidence of the Crown witnesses in respect of factual matters not dealt with by the accused in his evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition. In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt. The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months. The fine and surcharge were confirmed. 1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred. When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate. 2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law. The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249. Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required. Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient. 3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase. There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses. 4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances. The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct. The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity. It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all. The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea. 5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive. The conduct was at the low end of the continuum. He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living. He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle. Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here."

The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant did not constitute a change in use. It was clear that initially, the development officers considered the present use of the subject property as a club to be a non-conforming use. The adverse impact of neighbourhood effects generated by added or modified activities constitutes one of the guiding principles under the common law provinces City of Toronto v.

The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.

At trial the Provincial Court Judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the breathalyzer demand. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The findings of the trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the appellant had been drinking, had a very slight accident, and failed the SL-2. There is an exception to this rule in a case in which the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict. depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be another conviction.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty. While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

The Court also imposed a fine of $200 on the accused for failing to comply with the Regulations and the Animal Disease and Protection Act with respect to detection and control of rabies.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns."

The court ordered that the child pay monthly child support of $54 for the support of Jasmine and $70 per month for Sloane's hockey, golf and baseball expenses.

The applicant bank applied for a vesting order with respect to a sale of the real property. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price of the property. Notice of the application was served upon counsel for the bank and no opposition was taken to this application. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, R.S. 1978, c. L-5.1 was nevertheless reintroduced in the new Land Titling Facilitation Regulations (LTRs) and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders.  1) The court concluded by the material presented upon this application that the reservations expressed by Matheson J., endorsed in the Court of Appeal decision reviewing the judgment in the Clarkson case do not exist or apply to the circumstances respecting the application presently before the court. 2) The applicant, and others having similar interests or circumstances in the future, are nevertheless cautioned to consider the direction of the court of appeal given at para. of its judgment concluding, as it did, as follows: [3] During the presentation of the appeal, discussion arose as to the proper procedure to be followed by a receiver-manager who has arranged sale of real property pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Court suggested that the first step was to make application to have the sale approved by the Court. The notice of application should be served upon the registered owner and all other interested parties. The onus is on the applicant to prove to the Court that all such parties have been served.  3) The Court was satisfied the jurisdiction of the Court was retained by s87 of the land Titles act, which was not brought forward in the old Land Title Act, 2000 combined with s. 12 and s. 65 of the Queen's Bench Bench Rules. It concluded that there were no other interests that would be adversely affected if the vesting ordered applied for is granted. No subsequent encumbrances, competing creditors nor the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment."
136,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s.11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to s253(b), and was arraigned on the information. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. An institutional delay of 13 months in the context of the accused charged with failing the Breathalyzer offence gives rise to an inferred prejudice and renders his trial unfair. The prejudice is such that it can not be remedied in any other way than by entering a stay. Accordingly the proceedings are stayed.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."
137,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, I decline to do so for these reasons. The chambers judge determined that the best interests of the children required the status quo to be maintained. The father's counsel argues that the delay since interim reasons were filed on December 4, 2003 has resulted in a new status quo, there has been only one occasion only during that period when the children did not have access to both parents in any six-day period (leaving aside the January vacation). This raises the question as to whether she has sufficient resources to care for these children appropriately. Given all the circumstances of this case, the immediate question is the effect of my order on the obligation to pay maintenance. The first issue that arises in considering this question is whether it is appropriate for me to interpret the effect on the order declining to lift. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father’s counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of the judgment does not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The parties were to be governed by the order of Wright J. unless otherwise agreed and until further order.","This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation."

HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)There was no Charter breach. The six-month delay was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.  2)The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was not so long as to result in any significant prejudice to the accused or to the society that would result if the accused were not to face trial for this charge. 3)The six months delay in relation to the offences occurred within what could be considered a reasonable period for the matter proceeding to trial and there was no evidence about how this causes the accused undue hardship.,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence."

HELD: The evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused was found not guilty on all of the tests and observations. The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application, and to comment on their relative reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence.","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The City had met its duty to accommodate with respect to the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the driver or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. The fact that others passed Mr. Kivela on the casual seniority lists had two major effects. First, any individual with more seniority would have priority for recall and for retention of employment at the time of layoff whether or not the available work was truck driving. The second effect of not being made permanent at the appropriate time is that he was not able to access the City's employment because of his disability. It was almost exactly the same solution that was implemented in 1982 when the City and CUPE agreed to hire the driver as a labourer and yet assign him to truck driving duties. 2)In bidding for permanent positions, seniority throughout the Department is considered. Permanent employees have priority over casual employees in bidding for any permanent position. If there are no qualified permanent employees who want to transfer into the position, priority is determined between casual employees based on seniority, amongst those who are qualified. 3)The fact that some of the casual employees, who started after the respondent was first hired as a casual employee and remained casual throughout his 16-year career, were able to work more hours than the respondent, pass him in total hours and thereby gain seniority ahead of him. 4)The tribunal found that the respondent had met his duty of accommodate in ruling that the City should also have accommodated him retroactively when the respondent took steps to remedy the situation of others passing him by in acquiring seniority.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Crown had proven the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the counts of assault and battery. The evidence of tire marks on the driveway cannot be accepted as having any impact on the case nor is it suggested by the Crown that they should. In order to convict the accused of this charge the Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the intention. The accused did not intend to strike the complainant while she was laying on the ground.,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault."

143,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an application to vary a corollary relief judgment issued in 1998 and varied in June 2003. The parties were married for nine years and had one child, born January 6, 1989. The respondent was 46 and 42 years of age. The applicant had been supporting the respondent for 12 years. They separated in 1996. The wife was diagnosed with severe mental illness and had been hospitalized for six years. HELD: 1)The respondent was entitled and continues to be entitled by virtue of her continuing inability to become self-sufficient. The court must be mindful of the other factors set out in the Divorce Act as considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bracklow v. Fraser. 2)Spousal support should be time limited. It was not unusual for such orders to be indefinite at the outset. The mother was economically disadvantaged by the marriage, able to be posted away in pursuit of her career while she assisted with the care of their son. 3)The applicant's income was now primarily derived from his pension. He was awarded maintenance of $300 per month until August 2008. 4)The wife's disability was not an automatic ground for indefinite support. She required ongoing support.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support."

The complainant was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Court found on the issue of the credibility of the complainant. The court found that the accused was sincere and frank and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her."

The Crown tendered statements concerning two previous incidents in which the deceased alleged that she was choked by the defendant after he confronted her as to where she had been previously. The defendant choked the victim until she thought she was going to die and then sexually assaulted her. The victim testified that the defendant had choked her after she was assaulted by her husband. She also stated that she had scratched the defendant's left arm when she was found murdered and that she also had skin under her finger nails. HELD: The evidence was admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissibility of similar fact evidence. The trial judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the evidence is not tainted by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) The Court must not invade the province of trier of fact and condition admissibility on the evidence to prove issues of motive and intent and whether it is reliable. 2) The principles of the principled approach to the admission of similar facts evidence must not be limited to children's evidence in sexual assault cases. There must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting a finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 3) The evidence is presumptively admissible, without the need for voir dire, if it falls under an established exception to a hearsay rule because the exceptions all have certain inherent reliability. 4) There is a serious potential for moral prejudice if the evidence falls within a traditional exception of showing that the accused intentionally inflicted the injury, just as he had intentionally choked his wife in the past. The evidence would have to be excluded.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted.

However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."

The plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. Only one of the defendants was responsible for the decision to arrest the plaintiff and was solely involved in arresting him. HELD: 1)Credibility; 2)The plaintiff was lawfully arrested for obstruction. The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge are not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge were in dispute.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext."

Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion dated February 8, 2005, seeking from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants deny that Peak has any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim, or that the Beveridges have an obligation to pay dividends to the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment was dismissed.  2) The Court was of the view that s.34(2) of the Act does not prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2). 3) The amount sought to be recovered does not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. 4) It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross-examination of the defendant, Donald Beveridge, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. While the plaintiff does not specifically depose that there is no defence to the action on the merits, she concludes that it is her belief the defence does not apply to her. 5) There is no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiffs investment in the defendant. The realizable value of Peak's assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and amount that would be required to be paid to other shareholders. 6) The court was satisfied that there was no evidence before the Court as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment pursuant to Rule 129 of the Queen's Bench Rules.","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs."

The van was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries. Allstate joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act whereby it is defending the action against its insured Jerome Thomas under reservation of rights. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $162,500. The defendant was acquitted of all charges. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates a number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the identity of the vehicle, the owner of that vehicle and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it when the incident occurred.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle."

His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one Sandra Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to her. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases. 2) There was no notice given to the Crown of the application for fresh evidence and the original notice of appeal did not make reference to the possibility of an application to adduce fresh evidence, which would have raised a reasonable doubt in the appellant's favour. The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and (4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adducing at trial, be expected to affect the result.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered."

The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half due to mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as a 'creeping delay' resulting in uncomfortable conditions on board the plane. The plaintiff claimed negligence on the part of the defendants, unlawful confinement on the plaintiff's part and breach of contract as against the defendants MyTravel and Signature. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the specific allegations as contained in the amended statement of claim were true. HELD: The certification application was dismissed on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The court found that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendant as he was acting throughout in his capacity as an employee of SkyService and/or as agent and designate of Sousa and Rampersaud. The defendant was found liable for damages for bodily injury suffered by the passengers on the flight.  1) The plaintiff was found to have not proven that he or she acted within the scope of their employment. 2) There was no breach of the plaintiff’s duty of care to the passengers. 3) The plaintiffs were found to be in breach of their contractual obligations under the Montreal Convention of 1999. 4) The court was reluctant to deny plaintiff his day in court.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish.

The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? The individual items are as follows: non-arm's length salaries; personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses; capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and a Capital cost allowance. The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last three years and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances of this operation to use a three-year average.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."

HELD: The Court found that the respondent’s right to immediate free legal advice was violated and the Certificate of Analysis did not address the issue of whether the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. The Court concluded that the lack of a Prosper warning did not mean the respondent was not required to provide the police with an additional component of information once the respondent waived that right. The holding-off requirement flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded that making the police hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee in jurisdictions where duty counsel is unavailable, and where the detainee has been sufficiently diligent upon being informed of the right to counsel to trigger and sustain his or her ensuing rights, is consistent with the underlying purposes of s.10(b).","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."

The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. The lease term was not to begin until January 31, 2003. HELD: The Court found that the lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore it was not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of the PPSA. The leased equipment was the equipment that had been used and continued to be used by Sweeprite in its manufacturing processes. The total book value of the equipment was $331,738. The equipment was sold and the sum of $100,000 was placed in trust to be paid out in accordance with the determination by the Court of the legal priorities to the leased equipment in issue.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."

HELD: 1) The respondent has not engaged in blameworthy conduct. The court dismissed the respondent's application for retroactive child support.  2) There is no evidence before the court that the petitioner's delay between June 2004 and July 2006 (the first time the respondent broached the issue of revising child support by sending a letter to the petitioner) is a reasonable excuse for inaction. The respondent's failure to disclose her tax return on June 30, 2004 and each subsequent year constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. The petitioner has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. 3) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. No written request was made by the respondent within the meaning of s. 25. No verbal request was ever made by him. 4) The court should consider whether the mother's expectation that his/her support obligations have been fully defined the difference between an agreement and a court order cannot be ignored.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed."

The agreement contained four call options for the purchase and delivery of South American Low Sulphur Coal in quarterly installments of up to 100,000 tonnes. The court granted summary judgment but refused to award costs based on Tariff C. The issue was whether two or more plaintiffs, represented by the same solicitor, initiated separate actions unnecessarily; if so, any other matter relevant to the question of costs. HELD: The costs for the application were to be paid forthwith and were in any event of the cause.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract.

The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body. He was burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and set on fire. The flagman's failure to immediately halt the competition on noticing the presence of gasoline in the interior of the appellant's vehicle might be seen as negligent, but the flagman did not cause the fire nor contribute to the appellant’s injuries. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs on appeal.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."

Foley. The original Custody Judgment provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The mother failed to notify the father as to the child's whereabouts and prevented the father from exercising the shared parenting. HELD: 1) There has been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of original custody when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible. 2) The mother demonstrated that it would be more difficult for the father to relocate with the child to Whitehorse. 3) The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. 4) The threshold test has been met according to the Gordon v. Goertz case. 5) The child is too young to be able to take into account the views of the mother. 6) There is no question that the child will be better cared for in Whitehorse than in Saskatoon. 7) There was no evidence presented of firm job offers in the Yukon. The child was well adjusted socially and emotionally. The increased contact with her extended family in Yukon provides an increased social network that would be in the child’s best interests.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1) The Employer violated the collective agreement and was harassing and intimidating the faculty member. 2) The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test.  3) It is not necessary for every element of the tribunal’s ruling to pass the reasonability test. It is the policy and intent of the University to revise this statement of Academic Freedom as our collective wisdom grows. 4) The employer violated the Collective Agreement by suggesting that his dispute with the plaintiff should affect the opportunity for the plaintiff to appear at the symposium to present his research. In this respect, the board of arbitration found that the Employer breached the Collective agreement and interfered with the academic freedom of a First Nation faculty member by interfering with his academic freedom.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly."

The plaintiff's claim was grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which states that the union is entitled to indemnify its officers for actions done in the course of their office that made them the subject of the plaintiff's, or others, litigation. The union resisted the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the indemnity by-law and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association. Exhausting internal remedies. 1) The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of a high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 2) In the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts, the debate in the fourth action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. 3) In this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified under the terms of the union's by law. The dispute is in its essential character, contractual in nature; namely, is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of the indemnITY clause in the union by-Laws? 4) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of indemnity. In that respect, the contest in this case is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The argument between the plaintiff and Union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. 5) In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, the court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff”s claim and his application for summary judgment. 6) The plaintiff is engaged in litigation respecting the Union. The relationship between the union and its members is contractual and is governed by a written set of working rules and Bylaws.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success."

The bankrupt argues that allowing him a reasonably frugal family lifestyle will not permit him to pay his liabilities under the loan. HELD: The bankrupt is entitled to relief under S. 178. 1.1 of the BIA. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. No middle ground is available. 1)The bankrupt does not have the resources to discharge this liability now nor in the next several years. He is entitled entitled to a relief under Subsection 178. 2)The bankruptcy judge did not question the bankrupt's good faith in past dealings with his loans.

There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."

The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in failing to consider and apply the definition of'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him on this application.,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal."

The contract was frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. The plaintiff intended to construct a wood deck on the property. The defendant objected to the project as it was not reasonably forseeable by either party. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $176.22 for the loss of $3,604.13.  1)The contract was frustrating because it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the Ens job site. 2)The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract and cannot be self-induced. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to bear 65% of the loss and the defendant 35% of loss. 4)The court found that the supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."

He still works two weeks of 12 hour days (8:00 a.m. 8:00 p.m.) followed by a week off and contact with the father would be significantly reduced during these periods. 3) There was no evidence that there had been a material change to circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. 4) Access for the Christmas, 2007 and 2008 holidays was not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.

There was no unfairness to the appellant in the trial process. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. The fact that the agent was not a lawyer at trial did not prevent the court from allowing the appellant to proceed with the appeal. 2) The trial judge believed the complainant and as an appellate court, was in no position to review his reasons to determine if simply would have come to a different conclusion. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact. The process in situations like this has been developed by the courts so that an examination of the fresh evidence can be conducted to determine whether the accused's conviction result from the conduct of the trial. There is no reason why the same conclusion would not follow when an accused chooses to be represented by an agent who is not lawyer.","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

The evidence was part of the 'narrative' giving context to such events as Professor Van Bommel's e-mail to the appellant.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."

Niles, which dealt with the issue of retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the mother for retroactive variation of child support, a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses and a recalculation of costs. The court found that retroactive support was not justified because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. It found that the mother's blameworthy conduct warranted an award retroactive to date more than three years prior to the date of effective notice.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father."

The counterclaim was based on the fact that the defendant had cut down trees on the Claimants' property, by mistake, while allegedly doing a favour for the Defendant. The Court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. The Claimants were awarded costs of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $5,750.00. The claim against the Defendant was dismissed.","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial."

The company argued the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact that the sale price of the mall did not amount to an 'arm's length sale' because Ontrea was not a 'willing' buyer. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yielded, and that the adjustment of sale price did not require further adjustment. The Court also found that, based largely upon the affidavit of value accompanying the transfer and upon sale verification information he obtained from Cadillac Fairview and Ontrea, the company's sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property, which in turn represented the value of the real property, and did not include any non-realty items.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed."

The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clements was supported by probative evidence. The trial judge was overly generous to the appellant in even embarking on an analysis of the potential weapon to invalidate the contract.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis."

The plaintiff was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions. 3) The plaintiffs were awarded quantum of damages.","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."

He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter too severe. Dismissing his appeals with oral reasons, that the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that it must draw an adverse inference from the fact the grow-op operator was not called to testify. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons. 1) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if they concluded the photographs were of the appellant, they should also conclude that he was driving the Tempo. The trial judge did not err in suggesting that the appellant could not have outrun the police officer. The appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was the driver. 2) The appellant’s argument was misplaced. The jury was led to place a particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff's credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow operation. 3) The court was not persuaded by the evidence presented by the appellant that, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict reached by the jury in the trial was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, to render an unreasonable or cannot be reasonably supported by evidence.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v.

HELD: The application for certification was granted with costs of any cross-examination under Rule 317(1) being borne by the parties applying for the certification application. 1) The common issues being put forward for certification were not only devoid of the allegations of harm in the statement of claim but were inconsistent with the plaintiff's personal expectations and motivation as he explained them in paragraph 5 of his affidavit. 2) The issues to be resolved on certification application are complex and trial of an issue is not a practical alternative where there is conflict in the evidence. 3) The desirability of providing a complete picture of the proposed action, including the scope of the issues raised both in the claim and in defence, has generally been viewed by the courts as helpful in determining whether class action proceeding is the preferable procedure. 4) Cross-examination will not enable the plaintiff to recover anything for the issues important to him.","The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions.

None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

He pled guilty to three counts of identity theft. The accused had been in custody for two years and eleven months. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. The credit of four years and nine months was given for the time spent in custody. HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years imprisonment concurrent with the global sentence. 1)The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. He inflicted huge financial losses to say nothing of police investigation involving 15 police officers who expended almost one and one-half years of working hours. The time actually served on remand amounted to 1,336 days and cannot be attributed to the accused. He should receive a credit of double time.  2)The accused pleaded guilty. While it was a long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is even more important is that he eliminated the necessity for many people to testify and go through the consequent discomfort.","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors.

The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict."

HELD: 1) The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were adjourned for review by the interim order made in August 2010.  2) The respondent had no income when the child support order was made in 2006 requiring him to pay $500 monthly child support. The petitioner had 14 years of experience working on the pipelines. The respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. The parenting issue was best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility can be considered.,"The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support. HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011."
184,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on a range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. However, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. In all of the circumstances, the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that bodily harm to Dorion was objectively foreseeable by Knife as a consequence of the plot to which he was a party. After all, he admitted that his intention was to inflict 'hurt' on the victim.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."

The complainant swore she tried to flee after the melee in the hotel room and the defendant punched her in the face five times as hard as he could while threatening to kill her. The Crown had proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court accepted the complainant's testimony about the events at the hotel and found that the defendant physically prevented her from doing so on several occasions.,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial."
186,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault involving a 14-year-old girl. The accused had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant for approximately 15 years prior to the alleged incidents. The complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused when she was between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim in a manner that violated the victim's sexual integrity. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all four counts. 1)The accused's credibility was a mixture of their reliability (are they now accurately recalling matters they had proper opportunity to observe and commit to memory in the past?) and impartiality or honesty. 2)There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household might have lived and for what time periods. 3)The Crown's position as to whether the accused had committed any of the offences was not supported by the evidence presented by the complainant. 4)The evidence of each household was not exhaustive. The evidence was contradicted in important respects by that of A.G., the school guidance counsellor and the police. 5)The Court was not satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the accused was guilty of these offences.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end."

The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was convicted and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and 10 months probation. He appealed the decision of a Romanian court which increased the non-custodial portion of his sentence to 3 years imprisonment, and reduced his probationary term to 5 years. He now resides with his common law partner of 4 years but offers minimal information about his intended activities upon release. He owns no real property and has identified no significant activities which connect him to the jurisdiction. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for judicial inter alia release in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of a risk of non-appearance more severely than might otherwise be acceptable in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Code. 2)The application is for interim judicial release.  3)While Canada's legal obligations with respect to non-compliance are squarely before the Minister (given the nature of his pending decision under s40 of the Act), the applicant's ties to the community as being'minimal' does not engage those legal obligations. 4)The respondent's application for interim detention is for judicial relief pending the Minister's decision on surrender.  5)In light of the committal order, there is no reason to consider the third test under s679(3)(c).","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed."

The accused had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence. His record of findings of guilt, while not particularly reflective of violence, indicates lack of compliance with court orders. HELD: A period of custody is necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. 1)The accused had spent his pre-sentence detention in a secure facility. His injuries were intentional and foreseeable and the harm to the victim was intentional. 2)Given the young person's extreme and violent response in this case, it is clear that intensive programming for anger management is required. It is by addressing the circumstances underlying N.B.L.'s offending behaviour that public safety can best be protected. 3)The Court found the aggravated assault was a serious violent offence and designated it as such pursuant to ss. 42(9).","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required."

The accused argued that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's Charter rights were violated and that the admission of the evidence in the face of a breach of s. 254(3) did not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court concluded that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded."
190,Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and failure to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the Court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor car as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges. 1)The evidence did not support the Crown's argument that the bike was not a vehicle. 2)The accused did not have a licence to operate the bike. 3)There was no evidence that the motor vehicle was operating at the time of the offence. 4)The Crown failed to prove that the accused's bike was an electric bike. 5)The court was unable to decide whether there were pedals on the bike or whether the electric motor was operable.,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.

The plaintiff entered into a merger/purchase agreement with MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement in 1999. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The agreement provided that by virtue of clause 2.11 of the merger agreement, that agreement would prevail if there was a conflict between the agreement and the Partnership Agreement. HELD: The action was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.  1) There are no other provisions in s.8(2) that apply to this situation that may result in refusal to stay the proceedings. There is nothing in s8(1) that is relevant to the case.  2) The plaintiff argues a number of issues. The first relates to whether the arbitration agreement is invalid as it applies to the relationship of the parties and is in direct conflict with the arbitration clause, which purports to give an arbitrator the authority to resolve disputes and interpret law according to the Province of Alberta. The defendant, MNP LLP (“MNP”), seeks a stayed of the proceedings pursuant to ss. 8(8) and s. 9(2).  3) Arbitration at any time while this Agreement and any of its provisions are in force is a question of law and must be determined by the Court.","The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act. The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration."

The Court ordered that the trials be tried one after the other, in the manner determined by the trial judge.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence.

In his statement of claim the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of the defendant. The defendant responded by seeking an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules striking the action on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They also opposed the certification of the within actions on the basis that the relationship between them and the plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Dismissing the application and certifying the action as a class action, that the chambers judge erred in failing to properly apply the Anns test when determining whether a cause of action is a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c).","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act."

He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and rheumatology in the United States and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in s. basic child support and $249 per month in child support expenses. He did not comply with any of the support orders issued over the last 25 years or so. He managed to get away with paying only 5% of that which he owed pursuant to the 2001 order. 2) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he had not taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He was entitled to child support in the amount of $183,746. 3) The Court found that in the absence of some special circumstance, the respondent's child support obligation should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay and will not in the future be able to pay, is undue hardship. 4) The child remains a child of the marriage until order of the Court or agreement of the parties.","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."
195,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The offences occurred in 2011 and 2012. The accused had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration, followed by two years probation. The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence and imposed a 20 month sentence of imprisonment. 1)The Court found that the accused was at a low risk to re-offend and that the offences were of a pattern of sexual assaults. 2)The accused was found guilty of touching the complainant's breasts, touching her vagina and touching her inappropriately. 3)A sentence of two years incarceration followed by three years probation was imposed. The assaults did not involve penetration but the accused's previous relationship with the complainant established a pattern.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently."
196,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The sole issue was whether the plaintiffs and the lawyers with the Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest.  1) There was no delay in the application. 2) Even if the defendants' failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings was relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative. 3) The two lines of argument are not isolated from each other, as the court must take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including whether the lawyer possessed relevant information from a former client that could prejudice that client. 4) The relationship between solicitor and client is a fiduciary one. Lawyers are subject to strict ethical rules which find expression in codes of professional conduct adopted by the self-governing body in each jurisdiction. The obligation owed to former clients is one dimension of this duty. It is not the job of this Court to pass upon a lawyer's adherence to the Code, nor to punish or discipline lawyers. Nonetheless, where a matter of conflict is brought to the Court's attention, the Court must consider the matter with an eye to the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.
197,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that an in-court identification of the accused was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was admissible. It was not accurate to view the role of an accused person in the criminal process as passive.,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed."
198,Non_IRC | Issue | Reason | Conclusion | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"The Lawless children applied for and were granted provisional permission to attend a French language school in Maryfield. In February 2013, the CÉF informed the Lawless family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children. HELD: The Court dismissed the application to dismiss the claim and dismissed it. The Court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school because support for their success did not exist in this case.  1)The Court did not consider the facts of the lawless children's case. The court found that the Court's decision to not grant the children permanent admission to the school was based almost entirely on their special needs and accommodations relating to them, and it did not intend to interfere with the children’s integration into the francophone community.  2)There was insufficient evidence to establish that the parents were negligent in failing to provide adequate support for the children and that the court had no intention of interfering with their educational needs. 3)The children were denied provisional permission for the school for the 2012-2013 school year, subject to additional commitments from the school.","Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."

The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. At trial, the Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the accused's charges. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of both charges and excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician. The Court found the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the appellant's suspicion, and that the appellant had no problems walking or standing. The court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Jacques, 1996 CanLII 174 (SCC), [1996] and [2009] SCC 49 (CanLII). The Court reviewed the standard of appellate review of a trial decision which has relied on s. 24(2) of The Charter and found the appellant relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. The nervousness and lack of desire to explain what he was doing and the time of the incident were not factors that will be taken into account.",The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.
200,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of the land is a partial appraisal completed January 8, 2014 which appraises the mortgaged land at a market value of $85,000 to $125,000. The judge must use the substantial discretion vested in him to ensure a reasonable price on the one hand and to ensure that the sale not be abortive on the other. The court's direction on various aspects of the proposed order will assist both plaintiff's counsel and the bar in general.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful."
201,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the case was suitable for summary judgment because the facts were not disputed and the determination of a single legal issue would decide whether the plaintiffs had a tenable cause of action. The Court also found that there was no genuine issue for trial because the defendants had simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that the identical products were different. Therefore, the Court granted summary judgment and ordered the defendants to appear before the Court for a review of the merits of the claim. The court found that it was appropriate to hear the defendants' summary judgment application prior to the certification application.",HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.
202,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant had not been paid in full for the six years since the application was made. The court found that the respondent's application was not in the best interests of justice. The respondent had not followed through on his request for an assessment of his legal services over the past six years. It was not sufficient to require the respondent to retrace and justify six years of billings on the plethora of legal matters he was involved in with Cowessess. There was nothing in the evidence that indicated there was prima facie overvaluing or undervaluing of the services provided prior to January 2013.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated."

The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court, which determined that the trial judge erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal on the grounds that the respondent's response of force was no more than necessary to defend himself or effect an arrest. The appeal court judge did not err by applying the wrong standard of appellate review.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm."
204,Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The Court found that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant’s apartment suite to effect and arrest the accused. The accused was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the suite would be contrary to her section rights. The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry was excluded. The Court also questioned whether any officer had a warrant under s.16 of The Child and Family Services Act allowing her to enter her mother’ s home. The court concluded that the police officer did not possess a warrant to enter or apprehend the accused and that he was not attempting to act under the Criminal Code.,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
205,Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"HELD: The accused was charged with impaired driving and care or control contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had been arrested within seconds of encountering the accused that he had a reasonable suspicion for an ASD demand. He had no opportunity to observe the accused. He made the demand before asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. He failed to articulate the grounds for reasonable suspicion. The reasonable suspicion standard is very low and having regard to the evidence and existing law, that threshold has been met.","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code."

HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. The Court also found that her conduct over the last 18 months had shown that hers was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew. 2) The accused had demonstrated that she was motivated to overcome or control her addiction and that continued attendance at AA meetings would assist in identifying triggers that cause her to turn to alcohol. 3) Given the accused's two prior convictions for drinking and driving and her dedication to the AA program, it appeared that her pattern of drinking remained unchanged and her criminal conviction, fine and licence suspension did not deter her from offending.","HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years."

They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.

The respondent filed an answer and counter petition opposing the petitioner’s claim for shared parenting and an equal division of the family home and property and prohibiting the respondent from removing D.K. from the jurisdiction. The petitioner had been working full-time for the past four years and was earning an income of $7,199.00. HELD: 1) The Court held that the petitioner was entitled to a portion of the child support he would receive if he chose to live with the respondent. 2) The petitioner did not take a single vacation in the preceding two years, explaining he was self-employed and had no savings. 3) The court found that the respondent had a reasonable chance of obtaining a permanent residency in Canada. 4) The respondent had not taken any vacations in the past two years. The court was of the opinion that he had a reasonably good relationship with the petitioner.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."
